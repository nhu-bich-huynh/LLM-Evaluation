"We want to avoid the uncertainty where we are sometimes claiming that there is no responsibility either on the side of the Commission or on the side of the Member States."
"We have the opportunity now and the Court of Auditors is looking forward to assisting you in this task."
"The item is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"For the first time in 16 years, the European Court of Auditors has issued a positive statement of assurance with regard to both the reliability of the annual accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions."
"This is the end of a cycle that began with the Santer Commission, which resigned in 1999."
"This situation is due to the determination of the European Parliament and of its Committee on Budgetary Control to force the Commission and also the Member States - in matters relating to shared management - to manage European public funds correctly."
"I welcome the Court's work."
"I fail to understand why the Union does not enter into its accounts the EUR 37.2 billion that the Member States owe for staff pensions, since it has approximately EUR 44 billion negative own capital as a result."
"What an image to portray!"
"I wonder how we are going to be able to borrow on the markets to raise the EUR 60 billion needed for the stability plan."
"Lastly, I believe that this report has come too late."
"In any serious organisation, the auditor's report should be sent before 30 June in the year following the year audited."
"The quibbles about the complex issues and the many languages involved are not acceptable."
"The European Court of Auditors is now submitting its sixteenth report, through which it issues the statement of assurance concerning the legality and regularity of the operations on which the annual accounts of the EU budget are based."
"I would like to stress that the level of error in some operations remains high."
"For example, the Court of Auditors states that, for projects in the area of cohesion, the level of error is higher than 5%, which, in my opinion, is too high, despite the fact that there has been an improvement in recent years."
"In my opinion, the European Commission should make every effort to reduce the error level to the maximum acceptable level of 2%."
"It has to be said, of course, that the error level does not always indicate incorrect handling of delegated resources, but is often down to accounting errors in the administration of individual projects."
"In its annual report on the implementation of the 2009 budget, the Court observes in relation to the reliability of the accounts that some consolidated entities have not provided any statement in relation to their consolidated accounts, or have submitted an amended statement."
"The European Police College (CEPOL) is one of the entities for which the due information has been lacking for several years."
"This has important consequences, because, after an in-depth audit of CEPOL's accounts in July 2010, corrections were made to the accounts."
"Indeed, the 2009 financial report for the agency went back over the accounting management of the financial years 2008 and earlier, estimating the budgetary impact of the corrections at approximately 13% of the agency's current budget."
"Since the college became a community agency on 1 January 2006, the Court of Auditors has only issued reservations on the reliability of the accounts for the financial year 2007."
"That has not sufficed to put the accounts prior to 2010 back in order."
"Amendment of Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 establishing a programme to aid economic recovery by granting Community financial assistance to projects in the field of energy (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Van Brempt, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 establishing a programme to aid economic recovery by granting Community financial assistance to projects in the field of energy - C7-0139/2010 -."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you see before you a very happy rapporteur, because I think that we - and I very much emphasise the we - have produced a report that will hopefully soon be adopted almost unanimously, as all political groups in Parliament have worked intensively on it and in close cooperation."
"The report and the regulations it addresses have a lengthy history in this House."
"It had its origins, specifically, in the recovery plan launched in 2009 in the wake of the economic crisis."
"At the time, EUR 4 billion was freed up at European level, and these funds were earmarked specifically for economic recovery."
"The objective was that that money should also finance energy projects in particular: large-scale energy projects, devoted to carbon capture and storage, to infrastructure, and to a number of large offshore wind energy projects."
"At that time, Parliament having of course approved these projects, there were quite a few objections from various quarters and from Parliament itself, especially vis-Ã -vis the large-scale nature of the undertaking and the question of whether this or that project would create enough jobs."
"However, the most important criticism regarded energy efficiency."
"This was followed by a political agreement and the current situation is the result of that agreement."
"You would think that if Parliament, the Council and the Commission reach a political agreement about investing all surpluses in energy efficiency, that the report and the negotiations would be easy."
"That was not the case."
"We have been through some difficult negotiations, especially with the Council."
"However, I can say that we - and we did have to reach a compromise, let us be clear about that - were able to score a home run on most of the points."
"I would like to run through them briefly because they are crucial to a proper understanding of the current situation concerning the funds and how they should be implemented in the very near future."
"First of all, this is about renewable energy projects but, in particular, those which focus on energy efficiency."
"That, Commissioner, is what lies at the heart of the energy debate these days."
"I am very much in favour of renewable energy, but we know that, if we want really rapid results, we have to invest all our efforts in energy efficiency: it is a good solution if you want to reduce consumption; it helps alleviate the major problem of energy supply and - a very important point - it ensures lower energy costs for our companies and families."
"That is incredibly important."
"We are also working on industrial policy and we will definitely get back to you on that."
"Secondly, and this is very much linked to energy efficiency, the local level."
"Very often, Europe works almost exclusively with national Member States, and even the previous recovery plan focused primarily on major projects."
"Well, this one could not be more different."
"It focuses on the local level, on cities and municipalities, on small-scale projects which can be implemented immediately, delivering immediate results, and which can thereby have a major impact, not just on energy efficiency but also on jobs."
"That remains a very important consideration."
"Thirdly, funding."
"The previous major recovery plan consisted of what we call upfront funding; simply subsidising major projects, whether by means of cofinancing or not, because that is specific to Europe."
"It is the typical way in which Europe works."
"However, that is not the case with this fund and, for that reason, it is very innovative."
"The way resources are used here is by providing support in order to get those projects funded through guarantees and other financial means."
"With the exception of technical assistance, which is still funded through upfront funding, this means that you will have major leveraging."
"You need to multiply those EUR 146 million by approximately eight in order to get an idea of what the impact could be."
"I have now come to my last point, over which we have squabbled for a long time: the cap on money; that is, the money that is available to us."
"Parliament would have liked to see a different solution; which, indeed, was what we had agreed, let us be clear about that."
"Any remaining funds had to be invested in this project."
"We have reached a compromise: all the funds that are left over today have been registered and I firmly believe that this will mean that this project will be assured a long life - and I think that, if we carry on working together as we have done, we will also be able to ensure that it becomes incredibly successful for us."
"Just one more second, Madam President."
"I know I have run out of time."
"I would once again like to expressly thank everyone who has worked on this, in particular, all the shadow rapporteurs."
"I was particularly pleased with our cooperation, and I am not saying that out of politeness, but simply because it was an example of very fine and effective cooperation. Thank you."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, we are discussing the interim review of a successful programme to aid economic recovery in the energy sector."
"Up to this point, as part of the implementation of the programme established for us by Parliament and the Council, we have made 43 financing decisions for gas projects, energy infrastructure projects, offshore energy and carbon capture and storage."
"This has allowed us to spend around 98% of the entire budget of EUR 3.98 billion and to ensure that the programme has, to a large extent, achieved its objectives."
"There were only a few projects which could not be implemented."
"We are introducing this amendment regulation with the aim of meeting Parliament's requirements and initiating pilot projects for renewable energy, but importantly, also for energy efficiency."
"I regard these pilot projects as an opportunity to trial our activities in the field of energy efficiency, which will be one of the focal points of my work over the next year."
"I would like to thank Mrs Van Brempt very warmly."
"I would also like to thank all the strident Members of this House and the Belgian Presidency, because we have worked hard in this area over recent weeks and we are able to present a document today which will definitely provide a stimulus in the area of energy efficiency."
"In order to ensure that this amendment regulation, which is due to come into force now, takes effect quickly, our officials have already been making preparations for its implementation."
"In the next few days, EUR 146 million will be made available for projects which are important to all of you."
"Our partners in these projects, chosen by you, are municipal, local and regional authorities which have close links with the projects in question."
"These local partners will ensure that the funding is used in the best possible way, for public buildings, private buildings, combined heat and power facilities, district heating networks, decentralised renewable energy sources, more environmentally friendly urban transport systems and local infrastructures, such as intelligent networks, efficient street lighting and smart measurement systems."
"This means that we are doing something which will have an immediate local impact and which will act as a benchmark for my future activities relating to smart cities."
"If you make the appropriate decision today, our offices will begin implementing the amendment regulation straight away."
"In March or April of next year, we will definitely be able to report that our economic recovery programme is having a very positive effect, in the form of both large projects and small, decentralised projects, and is allowing us to learn lessons which will be important in future financial years."
"I would like to thank everyone concerned once again."
"Madam President, Mr Oettinger, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets concerning Mrs Van Brempt's report, I can say that the members of the committee very much welcomed this report."
"We have looked at it not only from a budgetary perspective, but also, to certain extent, with regard to its content and we have raised one concern, which Mrs Van Brempt was kind enough to include."
"This instrument is aimed at municipalities and rightly so, because this is where the greatest increases in efficiency can be achieved."
"However, I come from an area of Germany where the municipalities cannot take out any additional loans, because they are already too heavily in debt."
"This may be a problem specific to Germany, because of our local authority constitutions, but Mr Oettinger, as a former head of a Federal German state, will be only too familiar with this subject."
"Therefore, in Germany, we are in a position where those local authorities which should be making use of this programme are not allowed to, because the body responsible for supervising them has prevented them from taking on any further debt."
"We are very concerned about this. It could result in this programme being ineffective in these areas."
"We welcome this programme and would be pleased if it could be continued."
"We have called for the programme to have a separate budget line and we would like to transfer to it the EUR 15 million available in the agricultural policy area which cannot be accessed there because there is no legal basis for doing so."
"This is where the budget needs to be more flexible."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the decision to use the few remaining funds in the Recovery Plan started in 2009 in a different way and to take advantage of this opportunity to introduce a new principle with the setting up of an ad hoc fund is far-sighted and in line with what we have been saying for some time in this Chamber but have never been able to act on."
"We have seen a few timid signs, not yet brought up to date, in the Marguerite Fund."
"This represents, for us and for the PPE, a benchmark method to be followed for intelligent use of the European Union budget."
"The instrument is an ad hoc fund that deploys various methods such as loans, guarantees, equity shares or cofinancing, and will be governed by a special asset management company."
"The fund was set up with an initial sum of EUR 147 million and we do not understand why the door cannot be left open for the other residues due to the Recovery Plan."
"A significant sum could be raised by applying significant leverage through the EIB, the KfW, the Deposit and Loan Banks and other financial institutions, and this could have a great impact on the start-up of projects considered valid and given economic and environmental priority."
"From my point of view, the central aspect of the fund that will be set up by the end of this year is that it could become a kind of virtuous pilot project for the future organisation of a broader energy fund for appropriate inclusion in the next financial perspective 2014-2020."
"This principle could also be repeated for other sectors, such as TEN or eTEN networks."
"If you would allow me, some tangible sign at this critical time in the face of an employment crisis would make us all a little happier."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work, because far beyond the EUR 146 million that have been agreed, the impact of which we hope will be eight-fold, this initiative has important symbolic value."
"As the rapporteur explained, we are going to allocate funds to sustainable energy micro-projects, which will not only enable the realisation of important objectives such as security of supply and reducing CO2 emissions, but will also achieve an objective that has a very direct impact on the population: reducing energy poverty."
"The text that we are going to vote on is also important because it introduces an innovative financial instrument."
"This mechanism will help to overcome the resistance of financial entities to this type of project, as they will have the backing of international financial institutions."
"Finally, we should once again be satisfied that we have been sufficiently flexible to respect the good practice created in the Member States in order to structure the deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency."
"I hope that the implementation of this regulation will enable all the potential of those bodies to be developed, without the obstacles that tend to be imposed by excessive bureaucracy."
"Madam President, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur for the preparation of this report on energy projects and for the additional funds now provided by the Commission."
"EUR 146 million has been provided for projects which will be crucial for Europe and for the various countries and, in particular, as the Commissioner has said, for the local and regional authorities which will, I hope, be handling this money or these grants."
"I first of all want to congratulate the rapporteur on the presentation of her report on financial assistance for energy projects."
"I strongly welcome this initiative, which provides for the creation of a dedicated financial instrument to support the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects."
"The financing of projects in this area will help to stimulate economic recovery in Europe, and indeed in my own country, Ireland, and help to create new employment opportunities and also help in the fight against climate change."
"In all parts of Europe now, and particularly in my own country with a very high rate of unemployment, we want to ensure that all funding can be diverted into areas where jobs can be created."
"The funding of EUR 146 million which is available under the amended proposal must be targeted towards projects that will have a rapid, a measurable and a real impact on economic recovery."
"EUR 146 million is the funding that is available, but there is a multiplier of at least six or seven times that amount, which will be the overall investment."
"I believe that the establishment of a dedicated financial instrument will allow for this funding to be administered in the most efficient manner and the beneficiaries, as I said in my own native language, will include local and regional authorities."
"We all have a responsibility to bring this to the attention of those authorities, and our government will be making an individual application and then liaise with the regional authorities."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, today we celebrate a victory, albeit small, for green energy policy and a more European energy policy."
"I firstly want to thank our excellent delegation from all parties, under the leadership of Kathleen."
"I think we did a good job."
"(DE) I would also like to praise Mr Oettinger."
"Unfortunately, during the presentation of the energy agenda yesterday, we were obliged to be highly critical."
"However, this instrument has also come about because you have made a personal effort, in part in the face of opposition from the German Government and your partners in the Christian-Democratic Union in Germany, to ensure that it was able to happen."
"Why is it a small and bitter victory?"
"Because - and some have said this - this is EUR 150 million for the decentralised, the local, energy investments, where, on the other hand, we have billions - one billion for carbon sequestration, for example."
"I am still wondering if this one billion will be used."
"We are getting increasing indications that this project will not work."
"There is no balance between the decentralised, near-to-the-citizens, local-area projects and the big projects, some of which will, I think, fail."
"Why are we, as Greens, nevertheless voting for this project today?"
"It is because we are optimists."
"We are optimistic that this EUR 150 million, well managed, will create the base for a much bigger instrument which we will get under the next financial perspective."
"There are two conditions for that."
"The first condition is quality projects."
"I think that the EIB and KfW, which will manage it, will also look at deep renovation, and not only shallow renovation, projects."
"We need to leapfrog, especially when it comes to buildings and efficiency."
"The second condition is cutting the red tape for the local authorities that will apply for projects to get cofinancing."
"These two issues are crucial."
"Therefore, my questions to you, Commissioner, are: what will the Commission do to make sure that this fund will finance or give credit to quality projects?"
"And how will the Commission act to cut red tape so that local authorities have easy access to these funds?"
"Madam President, I will endorse every proposal to increase Union funds for supporting energy projects."
"Green energy should also be supported."
"However, it should be said honestly that the idea that green energy is the solution to all of Europe's energy problems - a kind of thinking which is often expressed here - is an illusion."
"However, the Union does need large, and I stress large, investments."
"The basic purpose of these is to ensure diversification of fuel supply."
"Such a solution is possible, for example, by building the Nabucco gas pipeline to connect the huge gas deposits in the region of Central Asia with customers in Europe and by developing transmission networks and building new interconnectors in Central and Eastern Europe."
"We do want to develop green energy, but at the same time, unfortunately, development of methods for extraction of shale gas is being completely overlooked and is not being appropriately funded."
"This is an unconventional gas which is already playing an enormous role in extraction in the United States and is giving America complete independence in terms of access to gas."
"Large amounts of this gas are found in France, Poland and Bulgaria."
"Here, in the face of the opportunity to use this great potential, complete passivity is to be seen."
"European solidarity requires that the Union support these projects as strategic for its future and as projects which guarantee the uniform development of all European states."
"It is a pity we are not talking, today, about great investments which will really solve our energy problems and unite and develop the European Union."
"While we are talking about important measures related to green energy, let us, however, remember that the idea that green energy will solve our energy problems is an illusion."
"I, too, would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has done on this subject."
"We are here to discuss a very specific programme to aid economic recovery, which is in the crucial area of energy in this case."
"In the current crisis situation that we are experiencing, proposals such as this one that help create jobs are essential."
"There is no chance of restructuring the economy if we do not make job creation our priority."
"This report sends a very positive message by drawing our attention to how to respond in this area at local level: how to respond specifically to local needs."
"We are in a period when we are debating, and will debate a great deal more, a series of legislative proposals in the field of energy, and we often tend to concentrate too much on the large-scale projects and networks, forgetting other causes in which intervention is absolutely essential."
"That is why I believe that this report could help us not only to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy, which is very important, but also to provide concrete benefits for local communities, which naturally means concrete benefits for the European public as a whole."
"That is why, Madam President, I wish to conclude with two final points: it is important never to forget that energy efficiency is also achieved, to a large extent, by cutting energy use through microgeneration projects like those included in this report; and, finally, it was a great victory for this House to ensure that the amount of financing to be allocated to these projects would be specified."
"That was not what we were aiming for, because we needed much more."
"I would therefore ask the Commissioner what he is seeking to do and intends to do to guarantee these needs."
"The submitted proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 is a response to the repeated requests of the European Parliament to create a new, single-purpose financial instrument for supporting energy efficiency and initiatives in the area of renewables."
"The support for measures in the construction industry to increase the energy efficiency of buildings, which annually consume up to 40% of energy in the EU, shows the justification for, and good sense of, this initiative."
"Funding to cover the activities of this financial instrument may be obtained by transferring unused resources from a number of programmes in which it is not objectively possible to use the allocated funding in time to the planned extent."
"An example of this would be the European Energy Programme for Recovery, which has a financial reserve of around EUR 150 million, as well as the multi-year GR programme for the climate sector, which was set up with a similar aim."
"I therefore think it would be very sensible to consider how we might best use the financial resources saved in order to extend the scope of the European Energy Programme for Recovery to include a new and, it would seem, necessary, single purpose financial instrument for supporting energy efficiency and initiatives in the area of renewables."
"We can make it easier for public bodies at the local, municipal and regional levels to implement projects in the area of energy saving and renewables thanks to this effective new financial instrument."
"(LV) Madam President, I am pleased that the European Union has learned to kill two birds with one stone."
"The first 'bird' is aid for business."
"At a time when the Member States are forced to cut spending and the banks are wary of giving loans, the European Union has come forward with a specific solution in the form of a new financial instrument."
"The second 'bird' is Europe's heavy dependence on imported energy."
"The aim of this new instrument is to reduce energy consumption and increasing usage of our own energy sources, such as wind, sun, water and biomass, thereby reducing our overall dependence on imported energy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I call on you all to support the creation of this new financial instrument to assist projects in the field of energy."
"It will help both our businesses in hard times and reduce our overall dependence on imported energy resources. Thank you for your attention."
"(LT) First of all, I would like to congratulate my group colleague for her significant work negotiating this document and including it in the issues that are especially important for the energy market of the entire European Union."
"In the context of energy security, it is particularly important to promote energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy, and secure the required financing for such projects."
"The successful implementation of such projects would directly contribute to achieving the energy objectives set by the European Union."
"This additional money will help local and regional public authorities improve financing for sustainable energy projects and implement innovative financial incentive schemes, such as guarantees and soft loans."
"Thus far, plans to promote energy efficiency, such as building renovation, which has already been discussed, have not been fully implemented."
"Therefore, I believe that this additional financing will become a good incentive to step up sustainable energy initiatives and projects, especially at regional and local level."
"(NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to compliment Mrs Van Brempt and her shadow rapporteurs emphatically on this important legislative initiative."
"I think that this regulation has real potential to be a powerful incentive for projects relating to energy efficiency and the exploitation of renewable energy."
"The regulation strikes a blow for sustainable energy and I welcome, in particular, a number of special areas of emphasis, such as: energy conservation, micro-cogeneration and integration of decentralised renewable energy sources embedded in local settings in electricity grids; and also micro-generation from renewable energy sources, and the use of renewable energy sources within the sector of public transport, electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles."
"The stress which Mrs Van Brempt and her shadow rapporteurs have placed on efficient outdoor lighting for public infrastructure and, lastly, on the search for electricity storage solutions, is promising."
"Thank you for your efforts."
"I hope that this can be a new step towards a genuine Green New Deal."
"(PL) Madam President, we are talking, at the moment, about something which is absolutely fundamental, not only when we are dealing with economic matters, but also when we are dealing in broader terms with the question of European solidarity."
"This is because energy is, in fact, the greatest challenge and the greatest test."
"Can that European solidarity work in practice or will it merely be a slogan or a catchword?"
"Or again - and this is certainly something expected by European taxpayers and voters - will it be put into practice in specific projects which will build European unity and which will show that in Europe, the different countries help each other, work on projects together and do not accept situations in which certain states from outside the European Union make agreements with other states over the heads of the European Union?"
"I think this should, at last, be said very clearly and directly."
"(CS) It is, without doubt, thanks to this Parliament that the volume of resources for projects in the area of energy efficiency and renewables has reached EUR 146 million."
"If it was up to the Member States, this figure would be substantially lower."
"Unfortunately, however, the legal form and structure of the fund remain uncertain, as does the question of what financial projects it will provide."
"In the interests of transparency, potential applicants should know who will decide on applications and how the selection committees will be appointed."
"If we are to dispel the suspicion that the newly established fund is targeted mainly at those who have not used the resources allocated within the EUR 5 billion package of the economic recovery programme due to non-implementation of projects, representatives of the new Member States should also be included in the selection process."
"The fund may be primarily intended for local and regional authorities, but we should also consider whether it would not be appropriate to allow private entities to apply as well, and not just where they are acting on behalf of public bodies."
"Increasing energy efficiency and the share of renewables should be a shared responsibility of both the public and the private sector, and European funding should therefore be available to both sectors."
"I see great opportunities in the combined production of heat and electricity, and in clean urban transport."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not easy to find so much unanimity in Parliament This means that the work was really outstanding and Mrs Van Brempt and all the other shadow rapporteurs should be made aware of this."
"It has been said that the resulting instrument is very positive for several reasons."
"It is positive because its procedures and timeframes are fast; positive because it is aimed at highly qualified project categories; positive because it is aimed at urban contexts, in other words, at local authorities which, by making specific decisions, are able to bring about real change in the state of affairs and improve air quality, housing quality and urban transport quality; positive because it is aimed at profitable projects and can therefore yield a return of resources; and positive, lastly, because the strategy will bring many more resources into play."
"In the face of all this, however, picking up on an objection raised by many Members, including Mr Geier, Mr Turmes and Mr Cancian, I wish to say to the Commissioner that the sticking point will be the implementation, the choice of financial intermediaries, the relationship with local authorities and how their financial difficulties are dealt with."
"Commissioner, this instrument raises the possibility of opening the way to other projects, to a stabilisation of this instrument and its extension to other sectors."
"The topic is crucial."
"The same thing must not happen that happened with the Recovery Plan and with the small and medium-sized enterprises that are still waiting for the EUR 30 billion approved by Parliament and the Commission at the end of 2008."
"(EL) Madam President, I, too, wish to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur on her very efficient work on such an important report."
"The report provides an important instrument for financing and implementing projects in the energy sector that will aid economic recovery at difficult times and help to complete the internal energy market and attain the climate and energy targets set by the European Union for 2020."
"The creation of a fund to support energy efficiency and renewable initiatives is especially important, even with a small initial endowment of EUR 146 million."
"I am delighted that the European Parliament has stood by its commitment to promote renewable energy sources and energy efficiency."
"Finally, I should like to comment on the need for a balanced geographical distribution of future programmes, so that they can benefit all the Member States."
"Greece received just 1.5% of the programme for natural gas pipelines."
"I trust that we shall have a fairer distribution in future."
"(HU) Madam President, it is such a massive achievement that Parliament's rapporteur and the Commissioner have jointly managed to make the Council retain this money in the funds available."
"This is a very important and highly significant event from our point of view."
"We hope that later on, we will be able to extend this to other budget chapters as well."
"It is just as important that we managed to spend this money on the original purpose it was earmarked for and, above all, through small and medium-sized enterprises and local authorities, on projects affecting the public."
"This is a truly important step forward."
"It is rare for the European institutional system to reach the public or small and medium-sized enterprises directly."
"This is why it is very important that we complete these projects successfully by 2014 and it would be of similar importance to examine efficiency in 2014 in order to improve the efficiency of this institutional system as well."
"I congratulate the rapporteur and wish for every success in spending the money."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, funding has been available, which should have been invested in the energy sector, among other areas."
"We have discussed this in great detail in the committee and we were not sure whether all the money could be spent."
"At that time, the Commissioner promised us that he would guarantee that none of the money would be left over or returned to where it came from."
"The most important thing for me is that the Commissioner has kept his word."
"He submitted a document to us fairly quickly which allowed us to ensure that the funding that otherwise would have been lost could be used for the energy sector."
"This was the first step."
"The second step was that Mrs Van Brempt managed to guide the members of the committee towards a solution and a compromise."
"She deserves our thanks for this."
"This was not easy, because it is simpler just to push through your own view, rather than finding a solution."
"This ultimately ensured, since we were also under time pressure, that the funding could be made available and could be used."
"Last but not least, we finally succeeded, with the help of the Council, and we must admit this in all honesty, in finding a compromise that allowed us to secure all the funding for the energy sector down almost to the last euro within the specified time and, as a result, to make sure that the funding was not lost."
"That was the most important thing for me and the most productive outcome and, therefore, I would like to thank everyone involved."
"(RO) I wish to remind you that in 2009, when the European Union's economic recovery plan was debated for the first time, the Commission made the undertaking that it would allocate EUR 1 billion to energy efficiency in homes."
"Unfortunately, this action has not been taken at the right time."
"Indeed, the 'smart cities' initiative has only had a small amount of money allocated to it due to the fact that, ultimately, if any funds remain unused, the Commission must allocate this money to the 'smart cities' initiative, which is happening via this regulation."
"I tabled an amendment calling for the level of management expenses and costs linked to creating and implementing the instrument not to exceed 5% of the value of each use so that the largest share of the money does not end up with financial intermediaries, but goes into investments for projects linked to energy efficiency in homes and the use of renewable energy resources."
"I also called for greater transparency and for the site www.buildup.eu to be used, not to mention for the applied model, whenever this instrument is used, to be made available free of charge to anyone who is interested so that we can benefit from best practices."
"I wish to congratulate Mrs Van Brempt for her report."
"I believe that energy efficiency must feature at the top of the European Union's energy strategy priorities."
"(RO) The Energy 2020 strategy launched yesterday by the European Commission marks an important step towards a secure, competitive energy market in Europe."
"It offers solutions to major issues such as how to diversify supply routes and sources, reduce energy consumption or coordinate operations with third countries."
"However, there are obvious shortcomings in terms of funding."
"The main aim of the European Energy Programme for Recovery is precisely to facilitate the funding of investments in this area."
"Its efficient implementation requires compliance with all environmental legislation and project promoters must keep to their funding commitments."
"In my view, active cooperation between national, regional and local authorities would facilitate the issuing of the required permits."
"Finally, I would like to stress the importance of public-private partnerships, which are a key element in the implementation of solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Van Brempt, for her excellent work and for an agreement that will at last make it possible to free up significant resources for the development of renewable energies and energy efficiency in the context of the challenge for green growth."
"The programme includes priorities that the Member States should take into account, particularly in achieving the objective of competitive modernisation of our energy infrastructures."
"Lastly, I wish to emphasise what I considered to be the qualifying points of the criteria for access by public authorities to finance, in particular, the commitment to work on multiannual strategies through a system of multi-level governance from territories to local authorities up to regional institutions and the institutions of the European Union, even in the context of rationalising the available financial instruments."
"This is an important result for the public and for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"(GA) Madam President, financial assistance for energy efficiency and renewable energy with the objective of economic recovery represents sensible and worthwhile investment."
"I totally agree with those who said that investment support for sustainable energy can be very effective and very beneficial, particularly when focused on the local level."
"By this means, we can provide a more sustainable future economically, socially and environmentally speaking."
"We must seize this opportunity to move towards a low carbon economy and facilitate the change for those who wish to change."
"Decentralisation is very important for sustainable energy."
"Therefore, this is a sensible, functional use of the unspent funds of the European Energy Programme for Recovery, if the opportunity is provided of facilitating the funding of investment projects related to energy efficiency and renewable energy through local and regional authorities."
"I thank the rapporteur for her extremely important work."
"(LT) Assistance for energy infrastructure projects from money earmarked to stimulate the European Union economy was debated and allocated a year ago."
"At that time, the money was intended for just two types of projects, which aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, i.e. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and wind farms in the North Sea."
"As far as this assistance and assistance for renewable energy in general is concerned, we generally cannot have a one-size-fits-all approach for the whole European Union."
"We must take into account the situation of each Member State, in particular, as regards energy independence."
"I therefore welcome the European Commission's proposal to review the procedures for the allocation of money according to the programme mentioned, taking into account the promotion of energy efficiency."
"However, I feel that we should not talk about this purely in the context of the financial crisis, because even once a normal economic cycle has been restored, the issue of energy efficiency will remain."
"The Member States should have the opportunity to react with more flexibility to changing circumstances and thus promote energy efficiency, energy diversification and an increase in energy independence."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the current difficult economic and financial scenario, Europe must continue to support projects in the sector of energy efficiency and renewable energy for a sustainable and social competitive economy."
"The means of operating the financial instrument must be improved in order to invest in decentralised projects to ensure geographical balance and promote even recovery."
"This financial instrument must be set up immediately and directed toward projects with a local dimension in order to impact on employment in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 663/2009."
"Credit lines that are able to complement worthy local initiatives are needed."
"Our preference must be for the financing of projects that also guarantee technological innovation to raise the competitiveness of industry."
"Unused finance within the framework of DG Climate Action's multiannual programme could be earmarked for the instrument and then directed towards projects within the sustainable energy field."
"I would like to thank Mrs Van Brempt for her excellent work."
"(PL) In January 2009, in response to the financial crisis, the European Commission proposed the reallocation of EUR 5 billion from unspent European Union funds, mostly to support energy projects which would contribute to economic recovery in the European Union."
"The European Energy Programme for Recovery, which is now being proposed, should be welcomed."
"Priority issues in this project are, in my opinion, support for cross-border gas and electricity infrastructure projects, including inter-connectors, and also support for Carbon Capture and Storage projects."
"I also consider it necessary to insist that the draft resolution also include projects in the area of electrical efficiency and renewable energy sources, which stimulate economic development by creating opportunities for additional jobs and help in the fight against climate change."
"Investments made in projects of this kind are most efficient when they are undertaken on site at district, regional and local level."
"Local projects involve a large amount of work, and this contributes to the creation of large numbers of new jobs."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with this EUR 146 million, we are entering an experimental laboratory together."
"Firstly, I would like to say thank you, because you have fought to ensure that it was not EUR 114 million, but EUR 146 million, and that the Member States were prepared to go slightly beyond their rather restrictive limit."
"As far as the experimental laboratory is concerned, we have four interesting questions to resolve."
"The first question is how we can achieve success in the field of energy efficiency."
"I believe that, of the three requirements relating to CO2, renewable energy and energy efficiency, the 20% increase in energy efficiency presents us with the most difficult and complex challenge."
"This is not just about mandatory national requirements, but about specific projects."
"Basically, we are using this manageable programme to evaluate which projects, such as building renovation projects and those relating to the field of energy in general, will be feasible."
"I hope that in two or three years, the first assessment of these projects for the next budget period will show that we have had some useful positive and negative experiences with regard to energy efficiency."
"I would like to make it clear that in two to three years, we will definitely be more knowledgeable than we are today and that we will have had some good experiences and made some mistakes."
"If this is the case, we will have invested the money wisely."
"Secondly, this programme allows the European Union to enter into a direct partnership with the municipalities."
"This is something which does not happen every day."
"It is clear that the energy requirements and consumption in public buildings and in private buildings that can be renovated, in other words, a smart city approach, can only be influenced by the EU via the municipalities."
"This means having direct contact with what is actually happening."
"Thirdly, I hope that we will be able to demonstrate with this programme that there is European added value for everyone."
"If we were only to obtain money from the Member States without providing any added value, we would be unnecessary."
"We must offer added value in the form of experience, effectiveness and competence."
"In this case, within two years, this programme will give us good arguments that we can use in the budget debates - a poker game involving the Commission, Parliament and the Member States - to obtain more money from the Member States in the interests of all the citizens of the European Union."
"This means that this is also an experimental laboratory for more budget funding."
"This controversial issue will affect every one of us over the next two years."
"Fourthly, we need an experimental laboratory for our partnership with the structural banks - the European Investment Bank (EIB) and KfW Bankengruppe - and with external private investors and funds."
"This means a partnership that goes beyond the Commission's offices with companies which have a close relationship with us, but which must demonstrate that they can do more than just manage public money."
"This may seem like a large amount of funding, but in fact, it is very little."
"This is not about the EUR 146 million."
"It is about a four-way test of our partnership with the municipalities, with the EIB and KfW, with the subject of energy efficiency at a local level, and with the proof that at a European level, this is the right area for more budget funding."
"With this in mind, I would like to thank you very much."
"Let us stay in contact."
"I am sure that in two years, we will all know much more than we do now."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, I note with gratitude that today is a public holiday in Belgium to commemorate the millions that died in two world wars."
"I am somewhat dismayed that this Chamber is not following suit and commemorating those millions, so I respectfully call for a moment of silence to commemorate all those who died in war in the name of democracy."
"Ms Sinclaire, you should know that the President is scheduled to make an announcement before the House votes today and then the time will be respected, as it should be."
"Madam President, as a Belgian Member of this House, it was a real pleasure for me to come here to work on a public holiday."
"As a result, I was able to reach the European Parliament from my home town in just 50 minutes, but that is entirely by the by."
"As rapporteur, I will be brief."
"Let me thank everyone, without exception, who has contributed to the debate today."
"We have heard some comments and very many good examples have been given."
"However, the connecting thread here is the enthusiasm over what we have achieved."
"Not without criticism, because I could very easily criticise the cap on money that has been set."
"There is a great deal of enthusiasm because this a good fund, because the money is available, because this is about energy efficiency and renewable energy and because this gives us, as Members of the European Parliament, the opportunity to take local action, too, through this project."
"That is what is needed."
"What is our common responsibility? In the first instance, of course, responsibility lies with the Commission, the European Investment Bank and other partners in this story."
"However, Parliament and us politicians are also responsible for ensuring that this project becomes a success, that it has a canvassing effect, and that involvement at local level becomes so large that the EUR 146 million multiplies not by eight but by 80, so to speak, because we have set many things in motion."
"In that regard, I have a lot of confidence in the Commission and the Commissioner. I know that this is a project which is close to the Commissioner's heart."
"He also has very good staff - as I have seen for myself over the past few months - and that will be very important for the outcome of this project."
"To conclude - I forgot to say it earlier, which is really remiss of me, particularly as a Belgian - I would make the point that the Belgian Presidency has given an exceptional account of itself here."
"To begin with, from the outset, a large majority in the Council was actually against this project. It is thanks to the major efforts of Minister Paul Magnette and his team that we now have a very good compromise and one that we will soon, I think, also adopt with a great deal of enthusiasm."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"In January 2009, the European Commission proposed reallocating a portion of unused European finance to support projects in the energy sector in response to the economic and financial crisis."
"Our discussion today on the report amending Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 is of particular importance: the proposal to use otherwise unused financial resources to support sector projects represents an opportunity in these times of difficult access to funding."
"In my opinion, the European Energy Programme for Recovery, which aims to finance initiatives and projects in the sector of energy efficiency, energy saving and renewable energies, supporting the investment of European public authorities, in particular, in urban settings, can give a tangible stimulus to the recovery of the European economy and the creation of job opportunities for young people."
"I am encouraged by measures on energy efficiency in the building sector, which uses 40% of EU energy, and that would represent a support to small and medium-sized enterprises at local and regional level."
"This assistance would also favour the development of promising initiatives in the energy efficiency sector at the level of local authorities which, due to the recent crisis, have suffered a drastic reduction in revenue."
"Ladies and gentlemen, last year I, too, welcomed the allocation of almost EUR 4 billion for projects in the field of energy as part of the Union's economic stimulus package."
"I also pointed out that the aid package neglected the Central and Eastern European region, which is most threatened from the aspect of energy security, and that energy efficiency projects did not benefit from the aid either."
"However, it would have been precisely through energy efficiency projects that the main objective of the package, namely rapid and effective job creation, could have been achieved."
"I am pleased that the new proposal allocates as yet unused funds to this very field."
"Renewable energy and energy efficiency projects are not only among the main means of achieving the 20/20/20 targets, but also increase supply security and competitiveness."
"These projects bring impressive results in the short term as well."
"They create new jobs in a geographically diverse manner and effectively dynamise economic actors."
"Spending the EUR 146 million fund on renewable energy and energy efficiency projects is a good start but we must admit that this amount is insignificant even at Member State level."
"We are very pleased that the Energy 2020 strategy unveiled by the Commission yesterday sets out the creation of an energy-efficient Europe as one of its main priorities."
"We trust that the strategic commitment to energy efficiency will also be reflected in the distribution of other funds."
"The European Energy Programme for Recovery provides a financial package amounting to EUR 3.98 billion for 2009 and 2010."
"It was absolutely imperative to create a financial instrument specially intended for using the funds in this energy programme, which could not be committed until the end of 2010, so as not to lose the remainder of the financial package."
"One particularly important aspect mentioned in the European Energy Programme Regulation is the geographical balance of the projects."
"This is a key element enabling the impact of this regulation on the economic recovery to be guaranteed across the whole of the European Union."
"It also acknowledges that there were projects in some Member States which were either not financed at all or only partially financed."
"Last but not least, I want to emphasise how important it is to renew these types of financial instruments aimed at promoting long-term energy efficiency in the EU."
"I call on the Commission to assess carefully the effectiveness of renewing these types of instruments and to examine the potential of using a similar approach in the future when dealing with other unspent funds from the EU budget."
"The opportunity to direct funds not spent according to the directive towards the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects was already set out in the regulation, but I welcome the fact that it was possible to find consensus as regards its specific implementation."
"Energy efficiency and renewable energy have frequently been named as EU priorities helping to implement the 2020 strategy and ensure energy security."
"Investments in this sector during the economic downturn are very important, as they will create a possibility for new jobs and will promote competitiveness, the spread of innovations and economic stability."
"Furthermore, the financial instrument planned - like the setting-up of a fund for European financial institutions - will increase the amount available several times over, thus increasing opportunities to finance projects."
"It is only regrettable that the financial instrument planned is not continuous, but hopefully it will establish a suitable incentive for further energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy."
"Crisis in the EU livestock sector (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Esther Herranz GarcÃ­a, Albert DeÃ, Mairead McGuinness, Giovanni La Via, Michel Dantin, VÃ©ronique Mathieu, Gabriel Mato Adrover, Herbert Dorfmann, Georgios Papastamkos, Mariya Nedelcheva, Filip Kaczmarek, JarosÅaw Kalinowski, BÃ©la Glattfelder, CzesÅaw Adam Siekierski, RareÅ-Lucian Niculescu, Sergio Paolo Francesco Silvestris, Elisabeth KÃ¶stinger, Milan Zver, Peter Jahr and Maria do CÃ©u PatrÃ£o Neves, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), James Nicholson, on behalf of the European Conservatives and Reformists, and Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, Paolo De Castro, StÃ©phane Le Foll and Iratxe GarcÃ­a PÃ©rez, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, on the crisis in the EU livestock sector (O-0141/2010/rÃ©v."
"1) - B7-0559/2010)."
"Commissioner, thank you very much for being here and for having shown so much sensitivity regarding this very important parliamentary initiative that is so necessary for the European livestock sector."
"The sector is particularly vulnerable to the crises affecting EU agriculture as a whole, due to multiple factors: the high costs of inputs, the fall in market prices, imbalances of power in the food chain and the current increase in cereal prices."
"The European livestock industry has to deal with these problems just like other agricultural sectors, but with an aggravating factor: the large investments that are particular to this type of production."
"As the European Commission is on the verge of presenting its communication on the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), I think this is a very good time to send a message of solidarity and concern to this group of producers."
"In my country, Spain, as in other EU countries, we are talking about a structural crisis, and the cereal price rises have just aggravated a situation that has been dragging on for several years now."
"The statistics show that a growing number of farms are being abandoned."
"However, this should not be the case in the context of global demand that will grow in the next few years thanks to the supposed improvement in people's standard of living."
"With a view to the forthcoming CAP reform, what measures is the Commissioner, or the European Commission, planning, taking into account the specific nature of the livestock sector?"
"I am talking about market measures, and other initiatives to prevent the models of intensive production that respect EU environmental standards being penalised by the future aid system, among other detrimental effects."
"Common-sense measures should be implemented that guarantee greater security of supply of livestock feed, the establishment of sufficient cereal reserves and the speeding up of the release of those reserves."
"Finally, to conclude, I would like to welcome the fact that this motion for a resolution makes special mention of pork and poultry, sectors that do not receive direct EU aid, but for which market and trade measures could also be established to alleviate their situation."
"author. - Madam President, first of all, I welcome the fact that this issue is being discussed here today."
"I think it is very timely."
"At present, the EU livestock sector is experiencing difficulties caused by a range of factors, including rising production costs, competition from imports from third countries, and, of course, various issues which contribute to the rising cost of feed."
"Although we have no control over droughts in Australia or severe weather conditions that affect the grain harvest in Russia, I do believe that Europe urgently needs to tackle its lack of self-sufficiency regarding protein crops."
"We are far too dependent on third countries for our feed and need to begin cultivating more ourselves."
"However, the situation at present is that we are forced to import a lot of our feed and I have said many times before that I strongly believe that the process of approving new types of GMO grain for import is taking far too long, and feedstuff from soya urgently requires to be speeded up."
"If this does not happen, livestock producers across the European Union will have to cope with rising prices, volatility and uncertainty for a long time to come."
"May I also briefly mention how the situation is affecting the pig and poultry industry."
"Farmers in this sector are feeling the crisis quite acutely, as their costs are rising and the price of pigmeat is falling."
"I would like to ask the Commission to monitor the situation closely and utilise all the tools that it has at its disposal to rectify matters."
"Beef producers, sheep producers, pig producers, poultry producers are all in a situation where they are making a loss."
"Need I go on telling the House that all these areas are actually suffering? But I have to say that ultimately, it will be the consumer who will pay because, if all the farmers stop producing, you are going to have to import this food from abroad, with all the problems this entails."
"So we have got to have security of our own food supply within Europe."
"If we do not do that, it will be at our own peril."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, the profitability of livestock production is directly linked to feed costs."
"In the growing context of volatile raw materials prices, decision making is becoming very complex for feed manufacturers and livestock breeders, as we saw at the start of the political year."
"The meat sector that is having the most difficult time is currently the pork sector."
"Therefore, I will focus my speech on the serious problems it is facing: the increase in the cost of animal feed, which represents 60% of production costs, and is therefore crucially important in terms of profitability for producers."
"In two months, cereal prices have risen by 50%, not due to an imbalance between supply and demand, as there is sufficient production, but due to speculation from outside the sector."
"Action must therefore be taken against speculation, along with a policy encouraging the holding of sufficient strategic stock to avoid speculation."
"We welcome the fact that grain intervention stocks are being put on the market."
"We just have to hope that their final destination will be the EU market, otherwise they will not help the livestock sector."
"A tax on exporting European cereal, as in the case of wheat in 1994, would be a possible solution."
"Another problem is the pressure of mass distribution with falling prices, which means that increases in production costs cannot be regained from the sale price."
"Producers' organisations need to be promoted that are capable of positioning themselves in the market, concentrating supply."
"The Commission is very much aware of the problem, but there is a lack of specific measures, which we hope will materialise in the future common agricultural policy, through efficient and flexible market management mechanisms to combat and act against the problems."
"This means combating speculation and using specific measures to promote the competitiveness of the sector in the market and increase its weight in the value chain."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to ask for the activation of the market measures applicable to pork, export refunds and private storage."
"The Commission does not think that the situation in the sector justifies this. However, in recent months, there has been a continuous decline in prices, and the prices received by breeders are below the average for the last five years."
"I believe it is justifiable for the Commission to trigger the existing market management measures, as some Member States have requested in the Council."
"Madam President, my answer will be in two parts, because the problem in the livestock sector relates primarily to the food situation and, hence, to the situation in the cereals market, and then I will also refer to the mechanisms at our disposal for the livestock sector."
"The Commission is following the situation in the cereals markets and its repercussions for farmers very closely."
"Cereal prices increased sharply over the summer due to supply shortages, particularly in the Black Sea countries."
"Thus, we have seen the price of barley and oats rise to as much as EUR 200 per tonne. At present, even though prices are very volatile, they are still well below the record prices of 2008."
"The strength of the euro against the dollar, which makes EU exports less competitive right now, is also a disruptive factor in the European market."
"Globally, despite the shortage recorded in Russia and Ukraine, the level of cereals harvested is normal, and stocks have been replenished thanks to the last two record harvests."
"In the European Union, average cereal production is estimated at 276 million tonnes, and if we add to that the stock from the start of the harvest, we have almost 60 million tonnes more than we are expected to use."
"The grain intervention stocks, which mainly consist of barley, currently stand at 5.6 million tonnes. A 2.8 million tonne batch has just been set aside for the implementation of the 2011 programme to help the poorest citizens, and the rest will be sold on the internal market shortly."
"The decision has, in fact, already been taken, and the cereals will be placed on the market at the end of this month."
"The pressure on the market has eased somewhat since the Commission announced this measure, which I recently announced to the Council."
"With regard to the situation in the cereals market, then, no emergency measure can be justified because, as I explained to you, the problem is not one of supplying the European market with cereals, since the high price of cereals on the European market is not due to a lack of market supply."
"The Commission is paying very close attention to market developments in the livestock sector, and more particularly in the pigmeat and poultry production sectors."
"The margins in this sector are, in fact, highly dependent on the costs of foodstuffs."
"Prices in the poultry sector are above the long-term average and appear to be at least partially offsetting the increased food costs."
"The price of slaughter pig is following the seasonal downwards trend."
"It is very slightly below last year's level."
"Production is currently well absorbed by the internal market and exports."
"Between June and August 2010, pigmeat exports were up by 10% and poultry exports by 21% compared with the same period last year."
"Consequently, despite these price issues, pigmeat and poultry producers have still been able to export for some time."
"The Commission will obviously continue to monitor developments in the market and will use the means at its disposal to intervene in the market if this proves necessary and useful."
"Indeed, two measures are currently available for the livestock sector: export refunds and private storage."
"With regard to export refunds, this measure would not be effective at present because the world price is rather high; therefore, an export subsidy cannot be justified."
"The relationship between the dollar and the euro means that export problems and a lack of competitiveness are possible, but this problem is not exclusive to the agricultural sector."
"We shall see how the rate between the dollar and the euro changes, and depending on that change, if we have surpluses in the internal market, we can then discuss private storage measures."
"For the moment, there are no meat surpluses in the internal market, and that is why private storage measures cannot be justified at present."
"However, I am willing to consider the possibility of resorting to these measures depending on how the markets evolve."
"On the issue of volatility, this will be addressed in the common agricultural policy reform for 2013."
"It is envisaged that this reform will include proposals for as yet non-existent mechanisms to address the issue of income volatility."
"As for the issue of transparency in the food chain, I am currently examining it with Commissioner Tajani to see how more information in this area could help clarify the way in which added value is shared out."
"Those are the answers I am able to give at this stage."
"Madam President, Mr CioloÅ, ladies and gentlemen, today's motion for a resolution will help to set the European livestock sector on the right course."
"I would like to thank Mrs GarcÃ­a for this initiative."
"The objective of the motion is not to cut Europe off from the rest of the world or to override the rules of the market."
"Its aim is to put in place fair market conditions for the European livestock industry, which will help to ensure food security for more than 500 million people in future."
"We must ensure that the European agricultural sector is not confronted with new and highly detailed production regulations on a daily basis and that farmers are not required to provide one certificate of competence after another, while maintaining high animal welfare and environmental standards."
"Rules of this kind apparently do not apply to imported agricultural products."
"Therefore, I am grateful to all the 534 Members of this House who voted in Strasbourg in favour of requiring agricultural imports to comply with European consumer protection, animal welfare and environmental protection standards in future."
"Mr CioloÅ, Parliament is ready to give you its full support."
"These standards must be applied to imports and this is why my group welcomes and supports this motion."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are here today to call on the Commission to implement suitable efficient and flexible market instruments to combat the crisis into which the European livestock sector has plunged."
"We hope that the proposal that the Commission will shortly present on market instruments for the milk and dairy sector will also include proposals to limit the impact of price volatility on the agricultural sector as a whole."
"Many actions can still be deployed to send out a strong signal to European livestock breeders."
"We believe, for example, that it would be very useful to the livestock sector to review the current ban on the use of animal meal for non-ruminants, for example, for the avian and fisheries sectors."
"As you know, this ban was introduced following cases of BSE but now, a few years on, the scientific community agrees in stating that the ban can only be justified for ruminants."
"In the case of non-ruminants, conversely, there is no danger to human health and the environment and we therefore hope that this ban may be overturned with the aim of offering these animals a greater possibility of higher-energy diets."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the livestock sector is an important traditional farming industry which represents the livelihood of thousands of producers across the EU."
"This sector is central to the socio-economic contribution made by agriculture to the rural areas of the European Union."
"It is a key agri-industry in Europe and even more so in Ireland, as Ireland is the fourth largest exporter of beef in the world."
"In particular, the high cereal prices exacerbate the problems for profitability amongst winter beef finishers, who have a higher dependency on cereal-based feed imports."
"There are three issues in particular that I wish to highlight: firstly, the necessity that the Commission put in place efficient and flexible markers and measures to curb extreme market price volatility."
"Action is also needed to close the gap between prices paid by consumers and prices received by producers."
"Secondly, it is essential that the Commission steps up measures to support the livestock sector in less-favoured areas, in particular."
"The next CAP reform must focus on the special vulnerability of certain livestock sectors and the significant production costs that farmers undertake."
"Under the next CAP, the excessive bureaucratic burden on livestock farmers must be addressed and reduced."
"Lastly, European producers comply with the most stringent regulations in the world in terms of food safety and quality, the environment, and animal health and welfare."
"These high standards must not put them at a disadvantage in comparison to third country competitors."
"It is crucial for the long term viability of the livestock sector overall that the Commission ensure that their actions on trade and agriculture do not compromise European farmers, but support the sustainability and viability of the European livestock sector into the future."
"Madam President, Commissioner, just as in 2007, world cereal prices are soaring, and farmers are seeing a sharp rise in their production costs as they did two years ago."
"Cattle feed accounts for 60-80% of their costs, and their revenues are plummeting: they survive on an average of EUR 700 per month."
"Must we wait for successive crises to destroy Europe's small-scale agriculture before we act?"
"Consumers pay EUR 17 per kilo of rib steak in the supermarkets, while producers receive EUR 3 per kilo - is that right?"
"On 7 September, Parliament gave its verdict by voting for the report on fair revenues for farmers."
"It urged the Commission to act swiftly and prohibit selling below purchase price."
"The MEPs took a stand, in Strasbourg, so as to strengthen producers' organisations, to stop speculation on the international markets and to control the influence of businesses in the processing and distribution sectors."
"Farmers expect even more: they want to see common market organisations established or strengthened, since they are the only means of stabilising costs and providing long-term economic visibility."
"Next week, Commissioner CioloÅ will present his proposal to reform the common agricultural policy; he will have to give some clear answers to farmers."
"Europe's credibility is at stake."
"Europe needs every single one of its farmers."
"Madam President, I very much welcome the fact that we are dealing with the situation in the livestock sector, because it is a serious one."
"I would like to draw attention to the problem which is the subject of paragraph 15 of the motion, namely, the problem of animal welfare."
"Standards of animal welfare should be obligatory and should be improved."
"I am emphatically in favour of ensuring that livestock have the best living conditions possible."
"However, the welfare of animals involves costs, and those costs are borne by the farmers, and there is a problem with unfair competition where meat products are imported into Europe from markets and third countries where no standards of animal welfare are maintained at all."
"This has to change."
"We should introduce these standards here, but we should also resolutely demand high standards - the same as we have in the Union - from all those who export their meat and livestock products to the European market."
"Madam President, Commissioner, lessons really must be learnt from the policies currently in force."
"The decision must be taken to stop this wholesale liberalisation of agricultural markets, which results in farmers earning, as someone mentioned just now, between EUR 700 and EUR 800 per month - EUR 700 and EUR 800 per month! - while the retail price of meat has risen by 40%."
"Make the decision to stop these excessive imports and stop the negotiations on that dreadful agreement to import 400 000 tonnes of beef from the Mercosur countries, as it would destroy entire regions."
"Have the courage, instead, to protect European agriculture and stop letting the World Trade Organisation decide the fate of our farms."
"Implement new tools for regulating production."
"Say 'no' to lethal competition within the European Union itself and introduce fair, stable basic prices, by promoting farming based on grazing."
"Take action to stop this appalling speculation on cereals."
"Commissioner, this is urgent; the situation is starting to take a tragic turn in our rural areas."
"A laissez-faire policy discredits the European project itself."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cereal price volatility is having severe repercussions on all livestock sectors but also on consumers."
"Cereal exporting is blocked due to the effect of the heat, fires, drought and floods - as is happening now in Italy."
"To aggravate the situation, Canada has reduced production following heavy rainfall this summer."
"Prices have been influenced not only by climate change but also by speculation on international markets."
"Cereal producers who are awaiting a price increase wait before selling their produce and put it in store, with the result that these agricultural products deteriorate."
"Speculation and severe climate change have led to a great increase in the prices of cereals used as animal feed and a knock-on increase in meat prices."
"I believe it is essential for the Commission to ensure timely, targeted action to deal with the volatility in agricultural-product prices through innovative market interventions under the new CAP."
"The Commission must prevent speculative practices in agriculture to preserve the businesses of farmers and stock breeders and guarantee consumers genuine quality products at fair prices."
"Madam President, I would urge the House to support this extremely important motion before us this morning."
"It is apparent to those of us who are from rural constituencies, and those who sit on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that the current position that many livestock farmers find themselves in is simply unsustainable."
"This is not an attempt to cry wolf, but if we do not rectify the problems identified within the motion, we will, as a consequence, face higher food prices and be more reliant on third country imports."
"Countries like China and the United States are all increasingly aware of the importance of food supply security and, as a result, are continuing to increase the support which they provide to agriculture."
"In Northern Ireland, the beef price is well below the cost of production."
"As long as the cost of inputs keeps rising, and extra-regulatory requirements continue to increase, then many farmers will exit the industry, resulting in land abandonment, lack of economic activity in rural areas and a reduction in food production across the EU."
"It is high time we recognised the importance of food security and the value of the work carried out by farmers across Europe."
"Finally, the current trade talks with the Mercosur bloc are having a destabilising effect within the industry."
"Coupled with difficult market conditionings and increasing costs, the livestock sector has been burdened with the further uncertainty created by reopening of the talks."
"The Commission is carrying on the negotiations and, regardless of the utterances of the Trade Commissioner, producers in Northern Ireland so far believe that the results can only be negative for European farmers and the quality of food being provided to the citizens of Europe."
"(RO) I think that we need to say right from the start that it is consumers who are the main victims of the crisis we are debating today, and not farmers."
"It is a known fact that in farming, cereal prices affect approximately 80% of the price of animal feed."
"This, in turn, affects roughly 70% of production costs."
"It is impossible to increase proportionally the sale price of meat to the producer."
"Livestock farmers have no contact with the end consumer, but deal with the processors who always have the option to import."
"At the same time, processors pass on their large profit margin which they have been accustomed to hitherto in the sale price."
"Unfortunately, this period is coinciding with a general economic crisis and the decline in the population's purchasing power is also affecting livestock production."
"There is another factor to consider."
"At a time when farmers will find it difficult to provide feed for their animals during winter, a huge number of them will choose to slaughter their animals, which will help prolong the crisis for more years in the future."
"In order to maintain domestic prices at a reasonable level and ensure animals receive the feed they require, intervention stocks need to be released."
"I am therefore pleased by the announcement made by Commissioner CioloÅ today."
"I share the view of my fellow Members who stressed the importance of growing new genetically modified organisms to provide cheap feed for animals and reduce the dependency on imports."
"Last but not least, today's debate is closely linked to the future of the common agricultural policy."
"We need a strong common agricultural policy which is well financed and well managed, and which can accommodate both structural development and modernisation measures, as well as market and direct support measures."
"(PT) We are all aware of the enormous difficulties that the European livestock sector is undergoing, the pig-farming sector in particular."
"This situation has a number of causes that are very clearly spelt out in the text of the resolution that we are debating today, the most important of which is high cereal costs."
"The European Parliament cannot remain indifferent to this situation."
"It is therefore necessary to act immediately using the available mechanisms, and on this issue, I welcome the Commission's decision to release 2.8 million tonnes of cereals, a measure that is positive but manifestly insufficient."
"New instruments must be found in the short and medium terms, for combating speculation in particular; in fact, the Commissioner has just said that that is the crux of the problem."
"Long-term solutions will need to be found in the context of the debate that we are about to begin on the new common agricultural policy."
"I therefore call on the Commission to take into account the recommendations made in the resolution signed by several political groups, including my own, because action is needed, in fact, and needed very quickly, Commissioner."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr CioloÅ, there is no question that the crisis must be resolved."
"However, this motion proposes solutions which we cannot support."
"Making the import of GM soya easier will not help to resolve the crisis in the livestock sector."
"On the contrary, we must begin to redevelop our own source of plant protein in Europe."
"Around 75% of our plant protein is imported."
"This is not acceptable and we need to introduce urgent changes."
"I also do not understand why many people are questioning the compromise which has been negotiated by all the groups and why they want to open the door to GM soya imports."
"That is not a solution."
"We also need to discuss what type of livestock farming we want in Europe."
"Once again, the small farms have been hit hardest by the crisis."
"On the other hand, industrial-scale livestock farming is developing in Europe which is not livestock friendly and which is not fair in agricultural terms."
"We ultimately need to do something in this area as well."
"My final point is that I am very surprised that EUR 450 million from the agriculture budget is being transferred to the ITER nuclear fusion project."
"I would like Mr CioloÅ to explain what we should think about this."
"(GA) Madam President, the result of the substantial increase in the costs relating to animal feed is instability within the European agricultural industry."
"The fluctuation of prices has an adverse effect on an already vulnerable livestock industry."
"The increase in costs of compound feed is pushing up production costs for the livestock sector, and more flexibility is needed in respect of assistance to this sector."
"It is time for the Commission to propose measures for reducing price instability and stabilising the price of feed."
"I am glad to hear from the Commissioner that he is considering a new instrument to deal with price volatility post-2013."
"Appropriate measures and instruments are needed now too."
"Madam President, I support Mr De Castro's remarks about meat and bone meal; deregulation in this area is highly necessary."
"The British livestock sector is struggling with high feed costs at present, and this is not helped by impediments which are placed in our way by the Commission."
"Top of the list is the individual electronic identification of sheep - a rule which is not applied to many other Member States, and nor is it a requirement for imports of sheepmeat from third countries."
"The impending ban on battery cages is producing huge distortions in our egg market, as caged eggs from non-compliant Member States can undercut our more expensively produced colony eggs."
"We have producers in this area running the two systems side-by-side before the deadline to try to recoup some of the GBP 400 million pounds we have spent complying with your rules which, of course, is putting more eggs on the market."
"Overhanging the entire British livestock sector like a lead balloon is the spectre of the EU opening bilateral trade talks with Mercosur."
"The British livestock farmer will be the sacrificial lamb in this deal and we are not happy about it."
"(HU) There are many reasons for the crisis in the livestock sector."
"Those who say that one reason is the unfair competition caused by imports and mention the dangers of the Mercosur negotiations are right."
"I wish to raise the issue of the surge in grain prices."
"It was foreseeable that grain prices would rise, and I have said this several times here in the European Parliament too."
"The European Commission has done nothing to prevent this."
"One reason for this problem is the reduction in intervention, which was a serious mistake."
"We must wake up to the fact that global grain trade is concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer companies."
"Incidentally, the same thing is happening in many of the EU Member States."
"The European Union decided not to keep emergency stocks, a decision which will further increase speculation in the future."
"The fluctuation of grain prices causes losses not only to grain producers but also to livestock breeders and consumers."
"In addition to this, the costs are also borne by European taxpayers."
"Remember that the European Union sold the 2004/2005 intervention stocks at an enormous profit."
"Grain prices were low in the past period."
"If the European Union had intervened then, a huge profit could now be realised from the sale of grains, which would also help livestock breeders."
"However, we have no such stocks, and this is not only bad for producers and consumers, but it also means that the European Union is deprived of the opportunity of providing aid to countries afflicted by famine, such as Pakistan."
"(HU) Firstly, Commissioner CioloÅ's efforts for the European Union to establish, at last, an appropriate protective mechanism against the global volatility of food prices deserve full support."
"Secondly, the high grain and animal feed prices point to the emergence of a shortage of protein in the European Union, on which Mr HÃ¤usling will draft a report."
"Thirdly, the fact that the common agricultural policy system is distorted, it over-subsidises grain farmers, and supports neither pig nor poultry farmers or livestock farmers in general, is another factor contributing to the current livestock crisis."
"Fourthly, livestock keepers are at a disadvantage in the supply chain compared to processors and traders."
"Fifthly, livestock keepers are forced to make disproportionately large environmental protection investments."
"This is particularly serious in the new Member States. This, too, should be addressed and remedied."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr CioloÅ, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs GarcÃ­a very much for this initiative and I would also like to refer specifically to the situation of livestock farming in mountain areas."
"In many regions of the European Union, there are agricultural alternatives to livestock farming, but this is generally not the case in mountain regions."
"If there were to be no grazing stock in the mountains, then many of the agricultural areas there would simply be useless and would be abandoned."
"This would not only restrict the business opportunities in mountain regions, but would also change the landscape and eventually reduce biodiversity."
"The dairy sector plays a special role in this respect, because it creates jobs and generates income in mountain regions and in other areas."
"This is why I believe that we must focus specifically on three issues in the reform of agricultural policy."
"We need a common agricultural policy (CAP) which takes into account livestock farming in mountain regions and provides subsidies to livestock farmers there."
"Secondly, we need a flexible second pillar of the CAP which makes it possible to provide special support for livestock farms in mountain areas."
"Thirdly, we need a quality policy which focuses, in particular, on products from mountain regions and which provides options for special labelling, so that added value can be obtained on the market for these products from the livestock sector in mountain areas."
"(PT) We are probably on the way to another commodities bubble."
"Prices on the international market have increased by more than 16% on average since June."
"Never has there been so much negotiating on the futures market, nor has there been so much money involved."
"Extremely low interest rates and too much money in search of good deals are leading to an increase in dealing and financial speculation on futures contracts, without any contact with the real economy."
"The figures for the largest cereals exchange in the world, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, are impressive, and transaction records are being broken in purchases of soya, maize and wheat."
"The practical result is the transfer of these increases to real market prices, even in a year when cereals are widely available."
"These increases in animal feed prices are causing terrible damage to the already difficult situation of many of our livestock farms, which will be unable to pass on the increases in what they sell because of the crisis and are unlikely to be able to absorb them."
"It is, therefore, time to take action and protect our food from financial speculation."
"I would like to know, then, what the Commission intends to do about this."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what a funny old world the agricultural world is!"
"A year ago, in this Chamber, we were all bemoaning the general production situation."
"Today, one production sector, the cereal sector, is doing better than the others - and I think we should, all the same, welcome that."
"However, its success is unfortunately having very serious repercussions for another sector, the livestock sector."
"The real issue today is the agricultural industry's inability to pass on the costs it has to incur to consumers."
"Therefore, as has already been said this morning, we need to help organise producers so that they can make their presence felt in their dealings with their customers and, in particular, in their dealings with the large-scale distribution sector."
"However, the chain, the functioning of the markets is more pernicious."
"How can we explain the fact that, for years, decades, we said that South American countries were placing a strain on production and bringing prices down?"
"How can we explain that, although prices are today increasing again in those countries, we cannot pass on that increase to our producers because, yes, there has been an increase in costs, but - and this must also be said - there has been no increase in producer prices?"
"How can we fail to mention the cost differentials that exist between our countries?"
"Admittedly, this is partly a question of national responsibilities. However, the dumping that goes on today between our various countries helps destabilise markets, and I believe that Europe should tackle this issue."
"Yes, solutions must be found."
"European cereal producers are aware, I think, of the situation faced by their main customers - farmers."
"They are prepared to enter into a contractual agreement."
"Are you prepared, Commissioner, to support that agreement?"
"Madam President, again we are here having a debate about farmers' incomes being destroyed by markets that are, to be quite frank, slightly dysfunctional in make-up and also cannot cope with major shocks like the grain price hike we are seeing."
"Surely it is time our farming and market system was stronger and I hope the Commission and the Commissioner notice yet again that the political groups in this House are further calling for an adequate CAP budget post-2013."
"The costs of inputs and overbearing regulations are making EU farms uncompetitive and the viability of our farm sector is deteriorating."
"Our grassland system of quality and environmentally sustainable beef production is being undercut by third country imports."
"We must give our farmers a fair chance and, in my experience, that is all they want."
"The EU's lack of self-sufficiency in grain is becoming a serious issue, not just for the beef but also for the pig and poultry industries."
"This motion is a statement of the seriousness with which this House takes ongoing developments in our agricultural markets."
"We as a Parliament must intervene when we feel the situation is urgent and, to be quite frank, Commissioner, our beef, poultry and pig sectors immediately need positive intervention."
"I look forward to your response."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, the situation this year is teaching us that an appropriate level of cereal reserves is essential to ensure food security and market stability."
"This security should be guaranteed by appropriate decisions at EU level."
"Another very important matter is the search for new sources of protein - this is a very good route towards the independence of European agriculture."
"We must, therefore, promote the cultivation of protein-rich crops."
"Let us remember, however, that it is our unconditional obligation to guarantee farmers permanent access to feed."
"For this reason, I support the motion which calls on the European Commission to establish a minimum threshold for the level of unauthorised varieties of GMOs permissible in imports of soya."
"Continuation of the policy of zero tolerance constitutes a threat to the entire food production chain."
"(EL) Madam President, there are currently two threats to global livestock farming and food."
"On the one hand, we have the seed monopolies, and we have seen the disastrous consequences of modified seed in this sector in India."
"On the other hand, we have the games played by financial organisations with the prices of basic products."
"In 2008, we had the biggest global production of cereals."
"In 2008, and here lies the absurdity, unless it is explained by financial games, we had the biggest food crisis, a food crisis that caused social disruption and the loss of many human lives."
"We need to monitor these two issues."
"We need to increase local resources, ensure that farmers have free access to seed and that livestock farmers also pay lower prices, and regulate the operation of financial organisations."
"(ES) Madam President, livestock farms are suffering the consequences of the crisis."
"Moreover, they have to comply with the strictest standards in the world, increasing their production prices, with the disadvantage that this gives them in comparison with third countries."
"I therefore think that the common agricultural policy firstly needs to guarantee sufficient funding after 2013 in order to ensure the viability of agricultural producers and breeders."
"Secondly, it needs to adopt specific measures for breeders that use sustainable protection measures."
"Thirdly, it needs to strengthen the measures to support the livestock sector in the most disadvantaged areas."
"Fourthly, it needs to stipulate that imports from third countries meet EU standards in order to prevent unfair competition."
"Finally, I ask the Commission to defend the interests of European producers in all trade negotiations, in order not to endanger the production of the livestock sector."
"Failing to adopt these measures could mean that Europe becomes a region without a sector that is dependent on imports and third countries."
"Madam President, the crisis in the EU's livestock sector has hit farmers hard in Scotland and there are many things we could do to help."
"Firstly, we could reduce the regulatory burden."
"It is madness that we apply more stringent red tape and regulation to our own EU producers than we apply to our competitors outside the EU."
"Our farmers are bound hand and foot by red tape, and yet we import vast quantities of foodstuffs produced under welfare and hygiene conditions that would constitute a criminal offence in the EU."
"The high cost of complying with all of this red tape is not reflected in the prices our beef farmers are getting for their cattle."
"British beef is now being sold well below the cost of production; lowland suckler-cow producers reckon they are losing around GBP 260 per cow; our dairy farmers have suffered a long spiral of decline."
"We have to stop the rot."
"(PT) The increase in cereal prices is another factor that is adding to and exacerbating the crisis in the livestock sector."
"The current common agricultural policy and the European Union's trade policies do not ensure a fair income for farmers, particularly small and medium-sized producers, nor do they prevent the effects of the increasing costs of the factors of production and the volatility of agricultural product prices: they worsen them instead."
"This volatility has causes that are not only, or even mostly, natural: amongst these is speculation on foodstuffs."
"Any measures that are taken in this area will always be limited in scope if they do not include banning the instruments that make it profitable, specifically derivatives."
"Safeguarding production, the right to produce, and food sovereignty and security require an end to the subjugation of agriculture and food production to the market and competitiveness."
"It requires effective measures for regulating and intervening in the markets, without which price volatility will get worse and concentration processes will occur, only to be survived by a small number of large producers."
"Madam President, I am very pleased to see the interest shown, including in the European Parliament, in a sector that is essential not only for market supply, but also for the stability of our regions: I am talking about the livestock sector."
"The answers to many of the issues and problems raised will no doubt be found in the proposals that the Commission will shortly be presenting on the future of the common agricultural policy."
"Parliament will also be able to discuss these proposals as early as next week."
"We will doubtless also address in them the issue of the fair distribution of aid among the various sectors, including the livestock sector."
"We will also address the issues of support for the livestock sector in more specific and more difficult areas and of mechanisms for managing income volatility."
"However, some specific questions have been asked which I should like to answer."
"The first one concerns the problem of cereal prices and intervention stocks."
"It is true that we no longer have the intervention stocks we had in the past, but this is because prices are higher now."
"Market intervention cannot be justified when prices are high."
"I believe that we must consider other kinds of mechanisms and, although stocks can play a part, we shall have to consider types of stock other than the intervention stock on the market that we had in the past."
"This issue should perhaps be dealt with at an even broader level than the European level alone, given that the market is now more open than in the past."
"On ITER, Mr HÃ¤usling: just because part of the 2010 budget has not been used for agriculture and is going to ITER does not mean that we do not have the resources to intervene in the agricultural sector."
"I can assure you that these additional funds that are going to ITER have not been taken from any CAP mechanisms; this money is still available and has not been used, because there has been no need to use it."
"Even with this transfer, however, I can assure you that we have the budget we need to be able to apply the requisite measures."
"I shall conclude by saying that the issue of volatility - and the impact that speculation on the market has on volatility - is one that the Commission is addressing more extensively, for derived products and commodities alike."
"I am working with my colleague, Mr Barnier, on this issue."
"The Commission will present some proposals."
"As for the distribution of added value along the food chain, together with Commissioner Tajani, we will organise a first meeting of the High Level Group on this issue no later than next week."
"I have received four motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (LV) These days, Europe's livestock farmers are experiencing difficulties that we must all overcome together in order to enable the livestock sector to develop and generate enough revenue for farmers."
"In the last few months, there has been a significant increase in cereal prices, made more acute by extraordinary events, such as the floods in Pakistan and the forest fires in Russia, for example."
"Of course, we have no influence over these climatic disasters, but it is within our power to draw up legislative proposals that could help Europe's farmers to overcome the consequences of these cataclysms."
"What is certain is that we can and must restrict speculation in cereals, which is also one of the causes of these difficulties."
"It is intolerable that such dishonest dealings cause losses for a sector that is one of the foundation stones of European agriculture."
"I should additionally like to remind you that it is essential for the Commission to defend the interests of European farmers in its discussions with the Mercosur nations on a new trade agreement and to ensure the conditions for fair competition."
"I call upon the Commission to begin working actively to help European farmers to overcome the existing difficulties in the livestock sector, as our support is vital for farmers."
"The livestock sector presents a number of problems for European farmers, including the rising cost of inputs, competition from third country imports, major fluctuations in feed costs and relatively low prices for meat."
"If we are to put in place a lasting policy for the livestock sector, we must take into consideration all the stakeholders, including farmers, consumers and the animals themselves."
"The objective must be to move away from industrial-scale livestock farming and towards more natural, respectful treatment of animals on small farms."
"All of this must be combined with the highest possible levels of safety for consumers in the form of comprehensive animal health services and clear labelling of all food products from animals, in particular, with regard to their origin and the way in which the animals are reared."
"The EU must put in place the basic conditions needed to safeguard the future of our farmers so that they can stay competitive internationally and their businesses can remain economically viable, despite the fact that we have the strictest animal welfare standards in the world."
"The increase in cereal prices is also a threat to the livestock sector in the EU on account of its dependence on feed imported from third countries."
"The situation is critical in the area of pork production, where feed accounts for 60% of production costs, but rising costs may gradually threaten all branches of livestock production in the EU."
"Europe should therefore reduce its dependence on the import of feed from third countries."
"It is surely no solution to switch to genetically modified feeds imported from the US."
"In the EU, it takes almost two and a half years to approve such feeds, in Argentina around three years, in Brazil three to five years, and China is also adopting strict measures in this area."
"In the US, on the other hand, approval takes only 15 months."
"The crisis in the EU livestock sector must not be exploited for the commercial ends of US companies, which see significant export potential in the European market."
"The European Union should aim to reduce production costs, to ensure that third countries comply with EU standards, and to ensure that producers get a decent price for their products."
"It is not acceptable for consumers to bear the consequences of higher prices, for producers to receive ever less money and for distributors to make ever greater profits."
"I do not agree with the Commission's view that no urgent measures are required, because we are facing a structural crisis which needs solving, and not only from the perspective of food security."
"European livestock farmers have been facing ever-growing difficulties recently."
"They are finding it difficult to cope with competition from third countries as the latter do not comply with the high standards which local producers comply with, and they are always victims of the European Union's commercial negotiations."
"However, we hope that we will see a different attitude adopted by the European Commission in future because it is not normal for European farmers to always lose out as a result of commercial agreements."
"The Commission also needs to be more involved in strengthening producer organisations in all livestock sectors, in order to enable them to negotiate better prices for their products, while taking into account production costs."
"At the same time, I call on the Commission to release as quickly as possible cereals from the intervention stocks to support this sector which has been hit hard by the crisis."

"This compromise document, this compromise text, has been long in the making."
"We have succeeded in reaching a broad agreement, and I should like to pay tribute here, before the ECOFIN President, to the Belgian Presidency, which has been directly and significantly involved in this matter, in particular, through the Minister's active participation in key trialogues, and I should also like to thank Commissioner Barnier, whose work has been particularly useful."
"Lastly, I should also like to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs, the Secretariat staff and the experts who assisted us."
"This work took more than 14 months, and there were 1 690 amendments."

"That concludes this item."
"Voting time"
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(PL) Mr President, alternative investment funds are of very great significance to the Union's economy."
"The managers of these funds have to keep to legislation and standards which enable the provision of services in the territory of Member States, and supervision of financial markets has to be accurate and effective."
"To this end, we must eliminate every lack of precision in the legal and administrative systems responsible for these funds."
"The proposals which have been submitted improve the transparency and efficiency of systems of supervision, and the greater effectiveness of legislation will bear fruit in an improvement in the stability and credibility of financial institutions, and, as a result, an improvement in the European economy."
"(IT) Mr President, today's vote represents a significant step forward by the European Union in the regulation of alternative investment funds."
"Under the directive, fund managers must be registered and authorised and respect stringent codes of conduct within the European Union."
"This is, in fact, the first time that this sector has been regulated, and I believe that the paper we have voted on has paved the way to achieving - soon, I hope - a true single market in financial products."
"I should like to emphasise the important role of the European Parliament, which has insisted on strong rules for greater monitoring of the financial industry, which will therefore also become - I hope you do not mind my saying it - more ethical."
"The lessons of the recent past, of the financial crisis triggered by excessive speculation by investment funds, should lead us to welcome this directive, which offers greater guarantees of protection to the public."
"I voted in favour of the compromise that was achieved and, finally, I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr GauzÃ¨s, on his mammoth task."
"Mr President, when we looked at the initial proposal right at the beginning, 18 months ago, we saw what many would describe as a 'wrinkly shirt'."
"This was clearly a proposal on which the industry had not been consulted - a proposal which would have shut markets, made it very difficult for European investors to invest in non-EU funds and led to a lower return for pension funds, affecting investment in developing countries."
"I was very concerned about those proposals."
"Fortunately, after the work between the shadow rapporteurs and excellent cooperation, as well as the good work by the Commissioner and the Belgian Presidency, we came to an acceptable solution that now works and which keeps markets open, increases transparency and ensures that European investors can continue to invest in markets outside the EU."
"We have to keep a watchful eye on the role of ESMA to make sure it does not block access to non-EU funds, but overall, we have come up with a compromise that is acceptable across the House."
"(LT) I voted for this very important document."
"Now that the European Parliament's decision on the abolition of visas for citizens of the Republic of China (Taiwan) travelling to the European Union Member States and Schengen States has been adopted by such a huge and significant majority, I sincerely congratulate the people of Taiwan."
"From now on, they will be able to travel to EU Member States without a visa."
"Furthermore, from today, all citizens of EU Member States, including Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania, will also be able to travel to Taiwan without a visa."
"I feel that Taiwan and its people deserve such a decision and I welcome this decision by the European Parliament."
"(DE) Mr President, I and my group welcome the fact that the citizens of Taiwan can now travel freely to the European Union."
"However, as far as I am aware, none of the EU Member States has recognised Taiwan."
"Nevertheless, I am not opposed to the visa liberalisation and I think it is a good thing that Taiwanese people can visit the EU without needing a visa."
"However, what is happening about Europe's newest state, Kosovo?"
"A total of 22 EU Member States have recognised Kosovo and only five have not done so, but the discussion on visas with Kosovo has not even started."
"The Commission has still not got under way with this."
"I hope that Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m will finally begin a discussion on visas with Kosovo in order to make it clear that the citizens of Europe's newest state can travel just as freely as the citizens of Taiwan."
"(SV) Mr President, the European Energy Programme for Recovery is an instrument used to finance investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy."
"Projects which can begin quickly and which will contribute directly to making the economy greener are worthwhile."
"The agreement, which ultimately released SEK 1.4 billion for the programme, represents a step towards a Europe that, with our combined efforts, will contribute to making it simpler and cheaper to be environmentally friendly."
"The launching of energy efficiency projects will create new jobs, make the economy greener and also enable us to be less dependent on oil-producing countries, which is particularly important in these times of crisis."
"This is exactly how the EU should work."
"Money that is not used can be allocated to other beneficial projects by means of this type of revolving fund."
"It took time for the Council to realise this, however."
"The negotiations were very difficult and the Member States did everything they could to try and wriggle out of their earlier promises."
"Today, I am pleased that we MEPs did not give in."
"During the negotiations, I endeavoured to introduce simpler rules and transparency in the application process."
"I am therefore very pleased that the agreement between the European Parliament and the Council is also clearly focused on keeping administrative costs down."
"Mr President, yesterday, the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, made an extraordinary speech in which he said that it was impossible to be outside the European Union in a globalised world."
"Of course, hence the lengthy dole queues snaking across Norway, or the food riots in Switzerland."
"But he went on to say something else: he said that the dangerous thing about eurosceptism today is that modern patriotism is based on a denigration of other countries, and here he could not be more wrong."
"A true patriot cheers the freedom of all peoples and values the patriotism of other countries."
"When Mr Van Rompuy went on to make his second point, which is that eurosceptism equals nationalism equals war, he would perhaps have been well advised to look at the aims of the allied powers in the two wars whose end we commemorate today."
"They were fighting for the freedom of all nations, for the restoration of sovereignty of all European countries."
"It was thanks to their patriotism that Europe was not united in tyranny, that sovereignty and independence were restored and, indeed, that the European Union became possible."
"Today of all days, he ought to remember that."
"Mr President, I welcome the decision of President Barack Obama to attend the EU-US summit this month in Lisbon and I voted in favour of the resolution today."
"There are so many important issues to be discussed."
"The EU-US agenda is full as ever, and both parties should use the opportunity to advance common positions on issues such as financial regulation, climate change, deepening of treaties and the fight against terrorism."
"Economic recovery, however, has to be the number one issue on the agenda."
"Our economic partnership is a key driver of global economic prosperity."
"Together, our economies account for half of the global economy."
"Therefore, we need to devise common strategies for our further actions to ensure a stable recovery from the crisis, including regulating the financial markets, the stimulus packages and strategies to efficiently address currency manipulation by other major global players."
"(NL) Mr President, I have voted against the Mann report because it is an example of politically correct self-blindness."
"Despite the fact that the mass immigration over the past 20 years has had disastrous socio-economic, social and political consequences, Mr Mann wants to allow even more immigration from outside the European Union."
"I found particularly cynical paragraph 110, which states that 'the creation of a climate among the population of the host country which accepts immigrants depends directly on proper and comprehensive information'."
"What this really means, in plain language, is that we will have even more one-sided government propaganda coming our way for multiculturalism, which has been a complete failure, and mass immigration."
"After all, if you want proper and comprehensive information about immigration policy, you will ultimately have to make a cost-benefit analysis of it and that is precisely what the immigration lobby does not want."
"Mr President, I have to say this resolution as a compromise was fine, but it seems to many in this House that it is too lengthy and it does not directly deal with the points we need to be making."
"It needs to be separated and shortened: the Transatlantic Economic Council issues could be shortened to maybe a 10-point plan, a three-point plan or whatever, so that we can actually use it when we finally go to speak to the Administration and our Congressional colleagues."
"I believe we also need to discuss issues such as a zero-tariff game, where current trade between the US and the EU can be enhanced and competitiveness can be increased by engaging in such a process."
"This could involve agriculture, but anyway, it is going to enhance whatever we do."
"Finally, Parliament must not wait for the Administration to determine what we do in TEC."
"We should set the agenda ourselves."
"It is all very fine voting for this - and I voted for it because I helped to negotiate it - but because of that, I realise that it also has its weaknesses."
"I think we should then look to the new Congress under John Boehner, who I am sure will be announced as Speaker, and Darrell Issa and his colleagues who we probably must welcome, in order to be able to do better business in the future on this issue."
"(NL) Mr President, a point of order."
"I made a mistake about the report and I also had a written statement about the European Union-United States summit, so I would ask that you allow me to present it now."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution because in my view, the European Parliament has to demonstrate that it takes seriously the issues of security, the fight against terrorism and organised and transnational crime."
"We are also serious in taking into account our relations with partners such as the United States, Canada and Australia."
"After the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament now has to give its consent to the agreements between the EU and third countries on the transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data, with a view to concluding those agreements."
"We must therefore use this power responsibly."
"In the light of the fact that Parliament has already decided once, on 5 May this year, to postpone the vote on the request for consent for the agreements with the USA and Australia, and that the current EU-Canada agreement on the transfer of PNR is no longer valid, we should make sure that when the time comes, we give the green light to these important measures, which will enhance security in the transatlantic area and beyond."
"(PL) Mr President, the Innovation Union initiative is crucial for the future of Europe."
"In PoznaÅ, in the region of Wielkopolska, where I live, the regional authorities have, for several years, held an annual event called World Innovation Days."
"This is a very valuable initiative, precisely because it is proper coordination at regional, national and European level that can make the Innovation Union project a success."
"Therefore, I endorsed the resolution on European Innovation Partnerships within the Innovation Union flagship initiative, and I think we should all be involved in action for innovation, because, as I have said, it is very important for the future."
"(LT) I voted for this very important resolution because I feel that the European Union's role in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe is particularly important for achieving the objectives set by the OSCE."
"Furthermore, it must be stressed that although they are very different structures, both the European Union and the OSCE follow the same principles and values, that is to say, respect for human rights and democracy."
"I agree with the resolution's provision calling on Kazakhstan to take concrete steps prior to the High Level Meeting in order to safeguard and respect fundamental OSCE values - human rights and the principles of the rule of law and freedom of expression."
"A public forum is due at the same time as the OSCE summit, and I really want it to be a success, free from any obstacles."
"Once more, I would like to stress that the OSCE must be led by countries that respect human rights and defend human rights and democratic values."
"They should be an example to other OSCE Members."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe that it makes useful and interesting proposals for facing future demographic challenges."
"Members States' social policies must devote particular attention to young people, the true driving force behind development and growth."
"We must encourage the immediate inclusion of young people in the labour market and their ongoing training to promote professional growth."
"The family must also be protected by means of more incisive and substantial measures because forgetting the family means overlooking one of the essential components of society."
"I therefore emphasise the importance of the paragraphs containing measures designed to promote the family."
"Besides, if we are to be able to manage the effects of ageing in a better and more effective way, we must also support the updating of social protection systems and pension schemes in particular."
"As Altiero Spinelli said, 'creating Europe depends on you as well', and this is now a real possibility."
"(PL) Mr President, the demographic changes which have taken place in the European Union over the last few decades have drawn attention to the necessity of reforming the system of social and retirement care and developing an effective migration policy."
"Encouraging people to take early retirement has become a common practice, and this has caused a fall in professional activity among people between the ages of 55 and 64."
"At the same time, a very serious problem is the unemployment rate among young people, which is higher than in any other age group."
"In relation to this, we should strive both to include and to retain in the labour market a workforce comprising different age groups."
"In addition, a more open migration policy combined with effective assimilation and integration could mitigate the results of insufficient population growth."
"Of course, I endorsed the report."
"(PL) Mr President, I endorsed the Mann report on the demographic challenge and solidarity between generations."
"It is a very good report, on a subject which is, itself, extremely important."
"The question of the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of age in access to goods and services is a key issue."
"If we are talking about solidarity, we should always remember, too, about this specific aspect of solidarity - solidarity between generations."
"Older people must not suffer discrimination because of their age."
"They have full rights as members of the local, regional, national and European community."
"The European Union looks after its young people - they are, for example, one of the priorities of next year's budget."
"This is good, because it is the young people, after all, who are going to decide the future of Europe, but, on the other hand, we should remember those who have already made their own very significant contribution to the building of Europe."
"Mr President, I fully support the Mann report."
"Indeed, I believe that solidarity between the generations is just as important as solidarity between Member States."
"I want to highlight three particular issues."
"I fully agree with paragraph 24, which speaks about an end to a compulsory retirement age so that people can choose when they want to finish working, but, at the same time, seeks to maintain a pensionable age, so that people who want to retire can do so and receive their benefits."
"I was particularly pleased to see that a number of my amendments on carers and family carers were taken into consideration, in particular, paragraph 125, which speaks about family carers, including the right for them to choose whether they wish to care or not, and also the ability to combine caring with paid work, and to ensure that they have full access to social security schemes and old age pensions."
"I am, however, equally supportive of the European Youth Guarantee initiative, which proposes that any young people who have been unemployed for four months or longer will be offered a job, an apprenticeship or additional training, etc., all of this to support their reintegration, or integration, into the workplace."
"As I said at the beginning, solidarity between the generations is crucial, especially in the current economic situation."
"(LT) I voted for this document by Thomas Mann because it reflects the problems of intergenerational interaction."
"Usually, we talk of the European Union's demographic problems from the point of view of young people."
"This document attempts to combine the specific characteristics of all the generations and related problems in health, education, labour and similar sectors, seeking balanced solutions to those problems."
"As far as the older generation is concerned, we should be grateful for its contribution to the development of the European Union, both economically and culturally."
"We must ensure that these people can grow old with dignity."
"However, due to ageing Europe, it seems that it will be quite difficult to achieve this."
"We must therefore not only create conditions for the improvement of family policy, but bring up a young generation which would be able to create added value, i.e. through the education system and non-formal education."
"Of course, we must make efforts as regards the integration of young people into the labour market."
"So thank you for this report."
"Mr President, demographers tell us that in order to sustain itself, a population needs a birth rate of 2.1 live births per woman."
"In the whole of Europe, the only country that is reproducing at sustainability level is Albania, or Turkey if you count Turkey as a European country - and nowhere else."
"According to one UN report, Europe, including European Russia, is scheduled to lose 100 million people over the next 40 years."
"Germany alone is going to see a shrinkage of its population by 20 million."
"These are not projections about what might happen if we do not do something, as there is nothing we can do about it now since the decline in birth rates has already happened."
"The only question is how we deal with it."
"How did we get to this stage?"
"What brought us to this pass?"
"One does not want to oversimplify, as there are obviously a lot of things going on, to do with changing working patterns, the spread of contraception, the different role of women in society, and longevity."
"However, I wonder whether one part of the problem is the way in which the state has expanded and squeezed out the private sphere, has annexed to itself jobs and duties that were traditionally discharged within a family - childcare, education and social security."
"The first generation raised with cradle to grave welfare or, in other words, to be excused the traditional responsibilities of adulthood, has also been the first to give up on parenthood."
"We now face a choice between demographic collapse or importing 100 million people to sustain our numbers and pay our pensions."
"This should be the top issue in Europe and it is not one we can address by arguing about changes in employment regulation."
"(HU) I welcome the Commission's proposal that our research framework programmes should go through a simplifying process."
"Over time, these programmes expanded due to good tender opportunities but, at the same time, the uncertainties related to administration and control increased."
"We need a new scheme that has greater confidence in tenderers and which, in addition to strengthening scientific and technical evaluation processes, also takes into account the simplification of financial and administrative processes."
"Naturally, there is a degree of risk in any financial transaction, but the exaggerated administrative control of such risks also increases the total costs of the whole process."
"We must strive to ensure that our research is attractive and accessible for the world's best researchers, European enterprises and universities."
"This also requires the harmonisation of rules and procedures as soon as possible, which should be done even during the Seventh Framework Programme, but certainly during the preparation of the eighth."
"For this reason, I, too, voted in favour of this proposal."
"(PL) Mr President, the foundation of Europe's economic development is investment in education as a form of investment in human capital and innovations which contribute to the creation of modern methods and technologies."
"To invest in innovation, it is necessary to concentrate on subsidising research."
"An example, here, are the framework programmes we have debated, which are the largest international research programmes in the world."
"By subsidising this kind of research, Europe has the opportunity to improve competitiveness in the global arena, create jobs for thousands of people and improve the quality of life of all Europeans."
"In order to maintain the highest standards in the framework programmes, the rapporteur has endorsed the maximum possible reductions in bureaucracy and simplification of administrative procedures."
"As a result, this would allow easier access to funding for this research in the European Union, and this, after all, is what we want."
"Needless to say, I endorsed the report."
"(IT) Mr President, facilitating access to the support system envisaged in the framework research programme means giving great impetus to the competitive capacity of the entire European production system."
"I am convinced that with today's vote, we have made a considerable contribution to achieving this essential aim, particularly for the small and medium-sized enterprise sector, which constitutes the backbone of the economy of every Member State."
"In fact, despite the high quality of their output, such businesses often do not succeed in gaining easy access to the resources that are necessary for boosting their production standards even higher."
"It is also useful to point out, as the rapporteur did, that the voting was extremely timely because it followed immediately from the intermediate evaluation of the Seventh Framework Programme and the preparation of the eighth."
"I thank the rapporteur for her work."
"(LT) I voted for the document on simplifying the implementation of the research framework programmes in the European Union."
"Unfortunately, I should point out that I missed the broader discussions during the plenary session, but the document itself is really important, and I welcome its adoption."
"It is important to establish a level playing field for scientists from all EU Member States, to provide equal payment for research activities, without dividing scientists according to their country's standard of living, because scientific progress is a matter for the whole of the European Union, not just individual countries."
"At present, the prevailing attitude is that work by scientists from the new Member States is less valuable than that done by scientists from the old Member States."
"Such a discriminatory practice is wrong and unacceptable."
"It is also important to ensure equal conditions for all research institutions, and not to divide them according to their size and financial capacity."
"This is particularly important for research institutions in the new EU Member States."
"It is not the size of organisations but scientific progress that creates value."
"Therefore, it is important to provide opportunities, not just for universities, but for non-profit research institutes and other scientific organisations, to submit applications and participate in research programmes."
"Therefore, I congratulate all scholars, and together with improved research mechanisms, we will move forward."
"Mr President, the Commissioner said he was willing to look at market supports where necessary and will intervene when necessary, but we need some kind of certainty for livestock farmers."
"They are being attacked on all sides; there is a huge increase in prices, partly due to speculation."
"I am very pleased to see that we carried the amendment which asks the Commission to deal immediately with the issue of adventitious presence of GMOs in imported feeds."
"That is something we have control over and we should deal with it, and we have been sitting on our hands and refusing to deal with it."
"We also heard about the high cost of compliance with EU regulations, so that we do not have a level playing field for third country imports."
"But perhaps one of the most crucial issues is the whole area of the food chain."
"Yesterday, the Court of Auditors issued a report on the sugar sector and one of their recommendations was that price formation be subject to regular monitoring by the Commission and that the Commission and the Member States ensure that competition law is correctly enforced in the sector, thus ensuring the treaty objective that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices."
"It is not only in the sugar sector that we need to do that."
"We need to do it in the whole food chain."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution because for years in Europe, we have seen frequent crises affecting the livestock sector."
"The causes are many, including a reduction in demand for mutton, lamb and goatmeat, partly due to the large-scale import of meat from third countries."
"The livestock sector has also been struck by indirect causes, however."
"I am referring to problems in the milk and dairy sector and the problem of cereal price volatility, which has seen severe speculation."
"With a view to CAP reform after 2013, it will be necessary to tackle the matter with commitment and come up with measures necessary for limiting the impact of price volatility in the agricultural sector once and for all."
"I therefore call on the Commission to develop more rapid instruments that make it possible to face up to the crisis situations within each individual Common Market Organisation speedily."
"(GA) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report and I was happy with some of the points made by Commissioner CioloÅ in his speech this morning."
"However, I want to say a couple of things."
"Firstly, the Court of Auditors report yesterday was a damning indictment of the Commission, showing that after EUR 1.2 billion in compensation, the closure of many factories and the loss of thousands of jobs, we are now only 85% self-sufficient in sugar supply."
"Secondly, during the week, I attended an agriculture seminar here and the same situation applied to fish coming into the European Union, particularly from Vietnam, some of which could even be polluted."
"In the livestock sector, the same applies, where third countries exporting commodities into the European Union can do so at an advantage compared to those within the European Union."
"A sine qua non for the European Union in addressing all these issues is to ensure that the same standards of regulation, the same checks and balances, and the same stringent enforcement applies to products coming in from third countries as to our own producers within the European Union."
"Written explanations of vote"
"Given that Ireland has requested assistance for 850 cases of redundancy at SR Technics Ireland Ltd, operating in the air transport sector in the NUTS III Dublin region, I voted in favour of the resolution, as I agree with the Commission's proposal, along with the respective amendments introduced by Parliament."
"I also agree with the request for the institutions involved in the process to make the necessary efforts to speed up the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) and with Parliament's position, deploring the Commission's serious shortcomings in carrying out programmes for competitiveness and innovation, particularly during an economic crisis which greatly increases the need for such support."
"in writing. - I wholeheartedly welcome the approval of â¬7.45m in EU aid to help retrain 850 workers made redundant from SR Technics."
"The support provided by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is urgently needed by the workers, their families and the North Dublin community, deeply affected by the closure of this company, which brought the loss of more than a thousand skilled jobs."
"I led an SR Technics delegation to meet Commissioner Å pidla in mid-2009, when the availability of this fund was confirmed to us."
"It then took the Irish Government six months to apply for the EGF, and seven more to answer to the Commission's request for clarifications."
"The slow and ineffective handling of the Dell application risks a return of much of the allocation to Brussels, and this lesson was disregarded."
"The Irish Government must act more swiftly to ensure that this aid is granted directly to those who need it, that it is not used to replace government funding, and that the training and re-skilling programmes offered are suited to the workers' needs."
"Astonishingly, the government is only now preparing to establish a coordinator for the fund, four years after its inception."
"I voted for the report on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund: SR Technics from Ireland, which will provide significant aid for the workers affected by the consequences of major changes to the structure of world trade."
"In order to better aid workers' reintegration into the labour market, the procedure for making the fund available will have to be faster and simpler."
"It is therefore necessary to identify suitable budget headings for making these transfers."
"The Irish company SR Technics has particularly suffered from the impact of the current economic and financial crisis on the aviation industry: it has lost significant maintenance contracts, forcing it to make more than 1 000 workers redundant."
"The loss of contracts and competition from regions that can provide cheaper services give rise to fears about the viability of this company and others of its type."
"In addition to agreeing that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund should be mobilised to deal with this situation, I must express my concern about the way in which airlines are cutting back on aircraft maintenance and repair, and the effect that this could have on flight safety."
"Another mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund has been approved, in this case for the application from IE/SR Technics from Ireland."
"Regrettably, as Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stressed, examination of this application was delayed by one year before being presented to the budgetary authority, as the workers were made redundant in April 2009."
"However, the support measures for the redundant workers include occupational guidance and training for the acquisition of basic skills, on- and off-the-job training for redundant apprentices, vocational educational training, and support for entrepreneurship."
"Finally, it should be stressed that the Committee on Employment had to draw attention to the need to present the unions' positions regarding these cases so as to guarantee that they can, if they wish, be involved in the application and in the implementation of the measures."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) has recently demonstrated on more than one occasion that it is a useful tool for combating unemployment, which is one of the frequent side-effects of globalisation."
"The EGF can be used to finance job creation measures, retraining programmes and workshops to support business start-ups."
"For these and other reasons, I wholeheartedly support Mrs Matera's report."
"To ensure that the money can also be used effectively, it must be carefully targeted and must reach its destination quickly."
"We must give priority to aid for European citizens and we must always keep this in mind."
"I am abstaining out of respect for the Irish workers ill-treated by globalisation."
"In the situation in which they are plunged as a result of the neoliberal policies advocated by the European Union, one could feel entitled to vote against the beggarly sum that the Eurocracy is reluctantly granting them."
"However, the little which is being given may relieve their hardship."
"This does not make the logic of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund any less despicable."
"It endorses the relocations that the owners of SR Technics have gone ahead with in order to increase their profits."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and the victims of relocations that occur in the context of globalisation."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers' rights."
"The aim of the EGF is to help workers who are victims of the relocation of businesses, and it is crucial in facilitating access to new employment in the future."
"The EGF has already been used in the past by other EU countries, so we should now grant this aid to Ireland, which has requested assistance for 850 workers made redundant from the company SR Technics Ireland Ltd, operating in the air transport sector, in the NUTS III Dublin region."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) receives annual funding of EUR 500 million with the aim of providing financial support to workers affected by major structural changes in world trade patterns."
"Estimates indicate that between 35 000 and 50 000 employees could benefit from this support each year."
"The money can be used to pay for help in finding new jobs, tailor-made training, assistance in becoming self-employed or starting up a company, mobility and support for disadvantaged or older workers."
"In order for the employees of a company to receive this support, at least 500 workers must have been made redundant within a period of four months."
"Therefore, the Irish company SR Technics Ireland Ltd is fully entitled to funding, because it has made 1 135 people redundant."
"I am voting in favour of the report, because SR Technics Ireland meets all the requirements for receiving support."
"The mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in the case of the Irish air transport company SR Technics does apply to the 1 135 jobs and could help to save them."
"Therefore, I have voted in favour of this report."
"My fellow Members, once again we find ourselves in this Chamber to approve an exceptional appropriation within our own borders."
"I say this with regret, as this measure implies crisis and a series of problems related to the economy, the labour market, workers and their families."
"However, we are fortunate to have such a resource available to us."
"This is exactly the type of situation in which the European Union shows its values and the reasons why it stands out from the crowd."
"European solidarity and the defence of European needs are values which must be defended and protected."
"This is the message that the European Parliament and the European Union wish to give out and I hope that there will be greater sensitivity in the transmission of this message, partly to combat lazy anti-European rhetoric and instead show just how essential support and assistance at the European level really is."
"I agree with the rapporteur and with the Irish authorities, who maintain that the global economic and financial crisis has had severe repercussions on the aviation industry and that the number of passengers, of kilometres travelled and of aircraft in service has undergone a distinct decline."
"I therefore support European aid for a sector that is vital to the relaunch of the Irish and European economy."
"Ireland's request for the deployment of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for 850 redundancies at the company SR Technics Ireland Ltd meets all the eligibility criteria set in law."
"In effect, under Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of 18 June 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the scope of the EGF was temporarily widened as it was expected to be able to intervene in situations like this, as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis, if there are 'at least 500 redundancies over a period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State, including workers made redundant in its suppliers or downstream producers'."
"In view of this, I voted in favour of the resolution, as I agree with the Commission's proposal, with the respective changes introduced by Parliament, and I welcome the fact that the Commission has identified an alternative source of payment appropriations to unused European Social Fund (ESF) funds, in line with earlier warnings made to that effect by Parliament."
"in writing. - With the adoption of this report, the EP requests the institutions involved to make the necessary efforts to accelerate the mobilisation of the EGF and, overall, recalls the institutions' commitment to ensuring a smooth and rapid procedure for the adoption of the decisions on the mobilisation of the EGF, providing one-off, time-limited individual support geared to helping workers who have suffered redundancies as a result of globalisation and the financial and economic crisis."
"It emphasises the role that the EGF can play in the reintegration of workers made redundant into the labour market."
"I voted for the European Parliament Resolution on the mobilisation of the EGF for granting aid to redundant workers."
"In October 2009, Ireland submitted a request for assistance to use the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in connection with the redundancies which were made in the company SR Technics, operating in the air transport sector in the Dublin region of Ireland."
"The global financial and economic crisis has reduced the level of air transport activity, which has resulted in a huge wave of redundancies in this sector too."
"In Ireland, 1 135 redundancies were recorded between April and August 2009, including 850 made at the company SR Technics Ireland Ltd. While acknowledging the important role played by the EGF in reintegrating redundant workers into the labour market, which is also corroborated by the 11 or so applications approved in 2010 alone, amounting to a total of more than EUR 30 million, I believe that this instrument is still not sufficiently well known and used by Member States."
"I also urge the European Commission to analyse the redundancies made during the economic crisis in the public sector and to develop a similar instrument to the EGF, which will support workers made redundant in the public sector in various Member States."
"Advocating the independence of an MEP's mandate is the responsibility of Parliament, and that independence cannot be jeopardised."
"In this case, the MEP is basically accused of offences relating to his management and accounting activities as chair of the board of the Polish Youth Card Association and Campus Sp. during a period prior to his election to Parliament."
"The offences of which he is accused have nothing to do with his activities as an MEP, and in this case, we should therefore proceed to waive his immunity."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"in writing. - (DE) The Polish citizen and Member of the European Parliament, Krzysztof Lisek, has been accused of three crimes by the district prosecutor in Koszalin in Poland."
"These are financial offences which are illegal under Polish law."
"In order to allow the case against Mr Lisek to be investigated under Polish law, a request for a waiver of his immunity has been made."
"As current European Union law clearly states how the immunity of Members of the European Parliament and waivers of immunity are to be handled, there must be a vote."
"I vote in favour of lifting Mr Lisek's immunity, firstly, because it will help him, and secondly, because this is the only way in which he can respond to the accusations made against him in his home country."
"I voted for the proposed waiver of immunity because I believe that the tabled request should be granted - provided that it is reasoned, even if just on the basis of reasonable suspicion - for the sake of the dignity of the institutions and in what should also be the interests of those involved."
"in writing. - Whereas Krzysztof Lisek is essentially charged with offences in relation to his management and accounting activities as chairman of the board of the Polish Youth Card Association and Campus Sp. during a period prior to his election to the European Parliament, and whereas the offences with which Mr Lisek is charged have nothing to do with his activities as a Member of the European Parliament, and whereas no cogent evidence has been adduced as to the existence of any fumus persecutionis, the EP has decided today to waive the immunity of Mr Lisek."
"in writing. - I voted against the GauzÃ¨s report on the AIFM Directive because it disadvantages an important part of the United Kingdom's most important industry - financial services."
"It has lumped all funds not already covered by the UCITS Directive, from investment trusts to hedge funds, in a single mixed bag of expensive legislation."
"It also has created burdens for European managers and investors in Europe that third countries do not place on their managers and investors."
"This will inevitably mean a loss of talent from London to countries outside the EU."
"As usual, EU legislation adds expensive costs to industry which disproportionately affects SMEs and therefore favours the big players."
"By punishing private equity funds, it will cause a loss of investment in the UK and Europe at a time that greater investment is needed to remain competitive in a globalised economy."
"It is applied at a low threshold which will particularly affect PE funds by bringing small funds quickly under the directive when they have made just a small number of investments."
"The capital requirements will be especially burdensome to PE and venture capital."
"Venture capital is needed to create new jobs in start-ups."
"Given that alternative investment fund managers represent around USD 1 000 billion of assets and therefore play an important role in financing the European economy, and given that the financial crisis arose in the investments market, although these funds were not directly related to the origin of the crisis, it is considered necessary to regulate all actors involved in financial services, and especially so to regulate these high risk funds: this will protect investors and foster stability in the markets."
"Such regulation plays a crucial role, because it replaces regulation at national level with regulation at European level, and provides for conditions for taking into account the specificities of the various funds covered, on the basis of their systemic risk."
"The establishment of rules of conduct for all financial services is being considered at a time of crisis, as is promoting a truly single market by making a framework of common European rules possible."
"The rules proposed by this directive provide greater transparency on the management of the funds themselves, as well as on how they are marketed within the European Union - by means of a simple authorisation in various Member States - and in third countries."
"in writing. - I voted against the GauzÃ¨s report on the AIFM Directive because it disadvantages an important part of the United Kingdom's most important industry - financial services."
"It has lumped all funds not already covered by the UCITS Directive, from investment trusts to hedge funds, in a single mixed bag of expensive legislation."
"It also has created burdens for European managers and investors in Europe that third countries do not place on their managers and investors."
"This will inevitably mean a loss of talent from London to countries outside the EU."
"As usual, EU legislation adds expensive costs to industry which disproportionately affects SMEs and therefore favours the big players."
"By punishing private equity funds, it will cause a loss of investment in the UK and Europe at a time that greater investment is needed to remain competitive in a globalised economy."
"It is applied at a low threshold which will particularly affect PE funds by bringing small funds quickly under the directive when they have made just a small number of investments."
"The capital requirements will be especially burdensome to PE and venture capital."
"Venture capital is needed to create new jobs in start-ups."
"The financial crisis that has hit the European Union hard has its roots in the 'unbridled' activity of numerous investment funds, particularly those from the United States."
"Amongst these funds, the alternative funds, or hedge funds, are characterised by aggressive speculation."
"This appears to be one of the major causes of the disaster, the consequences of which we are suffering today."
"In order to protect the future of the European market from the excesses of these alternative funds, I voted for the report by my colleague, Mr GauzÃ¨s."
"This text represents a major step forward in financial regulation."
"With this vote, we reinforce the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)."
"This European authority for financial markets will be set up on 1 January 2011 and will deliver, under strict conditions, a 'passport' permitting the activity of managers of alternative funds located in the European Union."
"The directive requires them to be authorised or registered, to respect operational and organisational requirements, and observe rules of conduct and transparency."
"It will subject them to the supervisory powers and ability to apply sanctions of the competent authorities of the Member States and of ESMA."
"At a later date, managers of funds located outside the European Union will be subjected to the same rules as those applying to European funds."
"I should like to congratulate Mr GauzÃ¨s for his outstanding work."
"I voted in favour of this report because I feel it is necessary to provide European savers with clear and safe financial instruments."
"I am convinced that we can only attempt to avoid further market destabilisation through strict and specific regulation."
"The report we have voted on today is therefore part of the broader framework of economic and financial regulation that the European Union is implementing."
"In this sense, the justified regulation of investment funds is also an effective instrument for preventing malfunction of the system such as, for example, excessive exposure to risks for subjects of systemic importance."
"I also support the idea of a European 'passport', which is being implemented by means of the authorisation and supervision applied to all alternative fund managers established and operating within the Union."
"Lastly, I welcome the requirements as regards the information to be supplied to monitoring authorities with the aim of guaranteeing greater transparency."
"The recent difficulties in the financial markets have shown that many of the strategies deployed by managers of alternative investment funds are vulnerable to some or even many risks affecting investors, other market players and the markets themselves."
"I voted in favour of Parliament's position as I agree that it is necessary to ensure that the actions of alternative investment fund managers should be subject to rigorous scrutiny in terms of governance."
"Alternative investment fund managers should be managed and organised in such a way as to minimise conflicts of interest."
"I agree that the organisational requirements established under the present directive should not affect the systems and controls imposed by national law for the registration of individuals working within or for investment firms."
"It is necessary to clarify the powers and duties of the competent authorities responsible for implementing this directive and to strengthen the mechanisms needed to ensure effective cross-border cooperation in the field of monitoring."
"The overblown financial system and its speculative action and lack of transparency were what caused the financial crisis."
"The crisis - like all crises - needs to be addressed with structural changes, a different modus operandi and barriers to prevent toxic products from being channelled into the economy."
"Supervisory measures, which need to be mainstreamed, are also important."
"However, neither the Commission directive nor the European Parliament's report guarantee real supervision and control of hedge funds and private equity."
"With its numerous exemptions and the terms laid down in the report for the purpose of supervision, speculation and a lack of transparency would appear to be here to stay."
"That is why I voted against the report."
"Although growth in the European Union is still suffering the consequences of the 2008 economic crisis, I voted in favour of Mr GauzÃ¨s' report because it helps rationalise the financial system through better control of investment funds."
"Indeed, speculative funds have been exposed as having helped exacerbate the crisis."
"By creating a 'European passport' system, the European Union is imposing a kind of 'code of conduct' on these financial bodies, which will now have to meet certain conditions within the European area."
"As a result, the single market will become more transparent and efficient."
"Following Parliament's vote, the Union is, at long last, going to regulate the activities of the most speculative investment funds."
"A long time has passed since Poul Rasmussen's own-initiative report which, back in 2008, proposed that strict limits should be imposed on these 'financial black holes'."
"It has taken the financial crisis to make the Member States and the majority of Parliament agree to adopt binding legislation on alternative funds."
"For the first time, these funds, whether or not they are based in Europe, will be subject to controls, restrictions on their activities and greater transparency; carving up businesses will no longer be possible, and the European Securities and Markets Authority's supervisory powers will be extended."
"Much remains to be done to supervise finance effectively in Europe;"
"ESMA, not the national authorities, should be the only authority with responsibility for this matter, and businesses should be protected even more from speculation."
"Had it not been for the reservations of the conservatives, the Union could have adopted more rigorous and more effective legislation."
"This is merely a first step."
"The text we have adopted will be revised in four years' time."
"This will be an opportunity to go further, on the basis of an assessment, in order to protect the economy and jobs from the damage caused by speculation."
"New rules for better economic governance are still being implemented but this nonetheless remains insufficient."
"By adopting, by a large majority, the report on alternative funds and capital investment, Parliament continues to implement new rules for better economic governance."
"Managers of alternative investment funds, which account for nearly USD 1 000 billion in assets, play an important role in the financing of the European economy."
"Although these funds are not directly at the root of the financial crisis, their management must not escape the need to regulate all actors in the financial services."
"Parliament has obtained the inclusion of new chapters on asset stripping and pay and has done a great deal to influence the rules regulating the passport system, responsibility of the depositary, requirements for own funds and recourse to leveraging."
"This is the first European directive that will regulate high-risk investment funds - hedge funds - and is the culmination of a negotiation process that has lasted more than a year."
"As the document says, the new rules aim to control the activities of managers and ensure greater transparency in the management of these funds, to protect investors and promote the stability of the financial markets."
"However, in truth, we have not got to the bottom of this issue: these speculative funds have not been abolished and there is still a derivatives market, meaning that the mechanisms allowing speculation still exist."
"An excellent opportunity to properly regulate the financial markets has been wasted."
"The Council and the majority of the European Parliament yielded in the face of enormous pressure from the financial lobby."
"The financial crisis has shown that the origins of the global financial system's dysfunctions are, firstly, excessive exposure to risk - these funds are an example of this - and, secondly, the weakness of the systems for managing this risk."
"The new European regulations establish common requirements for the authorisation and supervision of hedge funds, but they are far from preventing the continuation of serious systemic risk."
"We cannot, therefore, vote for this proposal."
"However, new directives are being debated and negotiated, so it is still possible to get to the bottom of the issue, specifically to put an end to these speculative funds."
"We will see."
"I voted in favour of the compromise reached, after months of negotiations, on the regulation of alternative investment fund managers."
"I voted in favour of it because, even though it has its shortcomings, it would be unacceptable to allow certain investment funds to continue to act with complete impunity when we know that they have helped exacerbate and spread the crisis."
"I deplore, in particular, the weakness of the provisions on leverage, the weakness of the guarantees regarding offshore funds, which will be able to obtain a passport, and the weakness of the obligations incumbent on private equity funds, which are often experts in stripping the assets of unlisted companies."
"I deplore the fact that we have to tolerate these predators operating throughout the EU subject to registration and minimum checks."
"However, what more could we have expected from a text that is aimed at regulating not speculative funds but their managers, and which seeks to manage risk rather than to prevent this speculation?"
"I voted for the text on managers of alternative funds because it is vital to legislate on this section of the financial markets, which implement strategies which are extremely risky and harmful to employment and the real economy."
"Many commendable advances have been made, such as, for example, the supervision of fund managers' pay in order neither to encourage nor reward disproportionate risk taking, to give just one example."
"The directive is clearly going in the right direction, even though it does have some serious shortcomings."
"In particular, it is disappointing that supervision is left to national authorities and not to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) created recently at the time of the vote on the financial supervision package."
"We must remain vigilant and we need to be preparing right now the next steps towards putting the markets back at the service of the economy, and preventing new financial crises."
"in writing. - This directive is one of the first legislative responses of the EU for the financial crisis."
"This directive is a move towards the new regulatory framework and supervisory framework of the financial markets."
"It is a first step in a good direction for the legislative process that will hopefully be completed in the not too distant future."
"It is important for these systems to be in place to prevent the regulatory crisis of 2008 from occurring again."
"I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on Alternative Investment Fund Managers, since I believe that fund managers must be registered and must respect certain basic rules of conduct."
"They, in fact, manage approximately USD 1 000 billion of business and therefore play a leading role in the financing of the European economy."
"This activity, as is ably described in the report, concerns entities and products that are very diverse, such as alternative and private equity investment funds, property funds and raw material funds."
"These characteristics make it a priority to take action at a European level which takes the form of a streamlined and specific regulation directed at all operators providing financial services."
"A regulation designed to guarantee greater stability of the financial system and better protection of investors; instruments that can be used to bring into being a true single market of European financial products."
"The GauzÃ¨s report is, unfortunately, a lost opportunity when it comes to achieving the effective regulation of the speculative funds that are at the root of the crisis."
"Despite the destructive role they have played, and the risk that these funds bring to bear on current financial architecture, the Council and the Parliament have given in to the intense lobbying of the financial sector to retain these extremely remunerative tools which benefit a minority."
"I therefore voted against this report which allows alternative funds located outside the EU to be marketed within it without having to comply with new European rules."
"This is a gaping hole which destroys all the progress made by this new legislation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today's vote is an important advance in the area of legislation on alternative investment funds."
"This means, above all, an improvement in transparency, substantial rules for regulating the finance industry and legislation which is more effective."
"I think that at a time when all countries are struggling with financial difficulties, alternative investments, if they are properly understood and properly used, can have a beneficial effect and contribute to an improvement in the economic situation."
"I should like to pay tribute to Mr GauzÃ¨s' excellent report on the directive on alternative investment fund managers."
"Thanks to this report, it will be possible to introduce more transparency, supervision and codes of conduct into the regulation of financial markets."
"This is a first successful step that I hope will be followed by other initiatives designed to thoroughly and comprehensively reform the financial system."
"I voted against this text and the European Parliament amendments that it contains."
"Contrary to its claims, this text regulates nothing."
"To vote for it would be to claim a victory for the financial lobbies over the general interest of the people."
"The financial crisis which occurred in 2007 was led by major investment banks which had a series of alternative investment funds, or hedge funds, in their portfolio."
"These were not supervised and often consisted of assets of doubtful value."
"The crisis reflected this situation, and now it is necessary to take concrete measures to ensure that new crises do not recur in the future, caused by financial mechanisms that no one controls and that often cannot be quantified."
"This directive approves a series of standards which, in being met, will make these financial mechanisms more transparent and able to be controlled, and thus act as another source of funding for the European economy, rather than the reason for its collapse."
"With the negative consequences of the economic crisis throughout the world in mind, I consider that it is quite proper for the European Parliament to try and control the activity of alternative investment funds."
"Given the huge EUR 1 000 billion turnover of these funds, any mistake in their application could have an extremely negative effect on European financial stability."
"This directive is extremely important and timely, since financial and stock market speculators and dishonest investors will always try to exploit these funds for their personal enrichment."
"The directive provides for certain restrictions and offers the EU the possibility to prevent the vulgar exploitation of these funds."
"I hope that this represents only the first step in this direction."
"Investment funds help to finance the European economy."
"However, the systemic risks involved in the different types of funds, such as private equity, real estate and commodity funds, are, of course, different."
"The stricter regulations which are being introduced in the financial sector as a result of the banking and financial crisis must cover all types of financial instruments."
"On the one hand, it is important to reduce the risk of losses and to minimise the potential for faulty decision making at a management level."
"On the other hand, this must not result in the introduction of unnecessary red tape."
"We also need regulations on short selling, because this played a role in the financial crisis."
"For this reason, I have voted in favour of this report."
"Alternative investment fund managers, who manage around USD 1 000 billion of assets, play an important role in financing the European economy."
"This sector is made up of a wide variety of actors and financial products, including alternative funds, private equity funds and real estate funds."
"It is important to take into account, in particular, the special systemic risks of private equity funds."
"The management of these funds should not be exempt from the regulations governing the entire financial services sector."
"The current financial crisis shows that the malfunctioning of the global financial system is partly due to key operators in the system being overly exposed to risk and partly due to weaknesses in the systems for managing these risks."
"The Commission's proposal and the report seek to achieve greater stability in the financial system and to increase the protection for investors."
"For this reason, I have voted in favour of the report."
"In Europe, alternative investment fund managers are responsible for managing a substantial volume of invested assets."
"They represent a significant proportion of the trading on financial instrument markets and can exercise considerable influence on the markets and companies in which they invest."
"I am certain that the impact of alternative investment fund managers on the markets in which they operate is significant, but the recent financial difficulties have highlighted the fact that the activities of investment fund managers can also contribute to extending and disseminating risks throughout the financial system and the economy."
"The aim of this directive must also be to create incentives for transferring offshore funds to the Union, thus guaranteeing advantages in terms of the regulation and protection of investors while also setting the correct level of income for managers, funds and alternative investors."
"I should like, in this session, to emphasise that uncoordinated national responses to such risks make it difficult to manage them effectively."
"I am voting against this report because it is content with regulating just the behaviour of alternative investment fund management companies, without touching on the nature or composition of the financial products in question."
"This commitment to the 'creativity' of the financial industry forgets the intrinsically destabilising and voracious scale of the speculation, of critical importance with this type of funds."
"The proposed regulations are also extraordinarily weak."
"They include so many exceptions and derogations at European level that they do not really break with the model of differential national regulation currently in force."
"The report also fails to clearly separate those who work with this type of funds and those who work in traditional banking activities, or to block the actions of speculative funds located in tax havens."
"Instead, by setting 'thresholds' on the value of 'systemically relevant' assets, it is clearing the way for formal fragmentation processes that will remove large numbers of the investment companies that are meant to be covered by the directive from its scope."
"The security of the European public's financial assets is a public good whose importance is too great for it to be exposed to the timidity of the proposed directive."
"The financial crisis has highlighted the need to subject the activities of the various players in financial markets to strict scrutiny, particularly bodies involved in the management and administration of alternative investment funds."
"In actual fact, the impact of alternative investment fund managers on the markets in which they operate is largely beneficial, but the recent difficulties in the financial markets have demonstrated that their activities are vulnerable to a whole range of risks, and adequate management of these requires a coherent framework across the European Union."
"Indeed, the establishment of a harmonised regulatory and monitoring framework at a Community level is proven to be suitable for the cross-border nature of the risks inherent in the activities of alternative investment fund managers, thus helping to strengthen the internal market."
"I voted in favour of Parliament's position for those reasons."
"I should like to congratulate Mr GauzÃ¨s for his excellent work."
"The EU directive on hedge funds, private equity funds and other alternative investment funds, launched by the European Commission in April 2009, in response to the financial crisis, and in accordance with guidelines agreed at the G20 summit, has finally been approved by a very wide majority."
"It is a step forward for European ambition to have financial governance operational from the start of 2011."
"These new rules would make the international financial system more responsible and transparent and make it possible to limit speculation."
"According to the directive, investors in speculative funds based in countries outside the EU (hedge fund managers are often resident in tax havens) will be forced to abide by the same conditions imposed on all European enterprises in order to operate within the EU market."
"In order to obtain this 'European passport' from the competent EU supervisory authorities, alternative fund managers will therefore have to accept clear rules, limits to speculation and greater transparency"
"in writing. - The Greens/EFA voted against this report, although Green MEPs voted in favour of the GauzÃ¨s report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The reason why they did so was that, by the time of the vote in that Committee, the text was by far more ambitious that the final agreement reached with the Council."
"The text is, admittedly, a first step in the right direction since hedge funds were not previously obliged to be transparent."
"However, the version issued by the Council does not satisfy Parliament on some of the key demands, and weakens some of the arrangements foreseen by the Commission in its original proposal."
"in writing. - I am pleased that there has been a conclusion to AIFM and that the issue of investment companies was taken into account and there will be greater consideration when legislative proposals are put forward."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left voted against this report on speculative funds."
"Despite its number of pages and the energy that its rapporteur seems to have put into it, this report is incredibly weak."
"Its content is really no match for the challenges we have to face."
"The proposals announced are even frequently at odds with what ought to be done to prevent a repeat of the subprime financial crisis of autumn 2008."
"The report will therefore not enable the European Parliament to put pressure on the Commission and the Council to make them stop this budgetary restraint policy that is gradually destroying all our social policy instruments."
"This is a bad signal to be sending out on the eve of the G20 summit chaired by Nicolas Sarkozy."
"It is quite right for us to try and learn from the mistakes that led to the global financial crisis."
"Although regulation is essential in some sectors, I personally prefer transparency and a duty to inform."
"If the banks had a duty to inform clients how they are handling their money, and what that means for them, a crisis could not happen."
"Regulation restricting the activities of businesses should be a solution only when the error in question cannot be corrected - for example, where human health or life is at stake."
"Let us therefore be careful when we regulate."
"The role of public institutions is not to deprive people of responsibility for their decisions, but to ensure they have the information they need when making decisions."
"Let us not forget that natural support for research and education comes from private sources, or investment funds, which lend money to promising entrepreneurial projects and invest in the development of new technologies, all with an awareness and a weighing up of the possible risks."
"If our quest for security reduces the appetite of investors to look for new opportunities in the EU, we shall always remain dependent on inefficient and bureaucratic public investment programmes."
"We shall then lag even further behind in the area of technology."
"I regard the submitted report as a compromise which addresses some of my concerns over regulation in this sector."
"I have therefore supported it."
"Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 establishes the list of third countries whose nationals are subject to the visa requirement to enter the European Union."
"Until recently, the island of Taiwan and the Northern Mariana Islands were included in Annex 1 of the regulation and were consequently subject to this visa requirement."
"Given that Taiwan does not represent any risk of illegal immigration or threat to public order for the Union, and given that the nationals of the Northern Mariana Islands are, as holders of American passports, nationals of the United States, it has appeared necessary to transfer these territories from the restrictive regime of Annex I to the less restrictive regime of Annex II."
"Consequently, I gave my support to the position of the rapporteur in allowing this transfer."
"The fact that Agustin DÃ­az de Mera's report was adopted by a large majority highlights the benefit of the decision to remove visa requirements for Taiwan."
"The European Parliament is therefore confirming the confidence it has in the major process of democratisation which has been undertaken in recent years."
"I would like to emphasise the remarkable economic progress which has been made by Taiwan."
"Taiwan conducts a significant volume of trade with the EU and its economy is number 25 in the world, continuing to grow by more than 13% annually."
"This sustained development reduces the chances of the EU facing an influx of illegal migrants from Taiwan."
"This is why I believe that facilitating the movement of persons must become one of the key features of bilateral cooperation."
"The decision to waive the compulsory visa requirement for Taiwanese nationals also takes into account their fulfilment of the technical conditions on travel document security."
"The introduction of biometric passports in 2008 is one of the constructive measures implemented so far."
"I hope that the European Parliament's decision will be approved by the Council and that the new provision will even enter into force this year."
"Finally, I think that the decision made by the Taiwanese authorities to lift the visa requirement for citizens from Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus is appropriate, given the need to respect the criteria of reciprocity."
"in writing. - (LT) This regulation lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the Union's external borders, and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement."
"The decision as to whether or not visa requirements should apply to third countries is taken on a case-by-case basis."
"The aim of the proposal is to abolish visa requirements for citizens of Taiwan."
"The European Parliament supported the aim of this proposal."
"It is very important to establish a common immigration policy, while developing trade and economic relations between the European Union and Taiwan."
"Economically, Taiwan has seen significant growth in recent years, and its income per head of population is currently the highest in the world."
"Taiwan is also an excellent partner cooperating in the fields of science, investment, new technology, education, culture and tourism."
"Therefore, lifting the visa requirement for Taiwan will enhance trade and economic relations with the EU."
"I voted in favour as I believe that Taiwan should be transferred to the positive list for granting visa exemption."
"Given the existing trade relations between the EU and Taiwan, I believe that this decision will have a positive impact."
"Most of the countries in this region that have a similar level of development have already obtained visa exemption, and this decision reinforces the EU's decision to prioritise policies which contribute to economic growth and the creation of more and better jobs, along with policies that contribute to competitiveness."
"I support the awarding of a visa waiver for travel by nationals of Taiwan, and therefore the country's transfer to the positive list."
"This decision will have a favourable economic impact on relations between the EU and Taiwan, which is already our 19th most important trade partner."
"The EU is also the largest foreign investor in Taiwan."
"It should encourage tourism: the EU is already one of the most important destination regions for Taiwanese nationals."
"It does not, by contrast, increase the risk of illegal immigration, since the average rate in 2006-2008 was 45 people, which is very low, or threaten public security."
"It increases regional consistency, since the vast majority of the region's countries and entities with a similar level of economic development already benefit from this visa waiver scheme: Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, South Korea and Singapore."
"I welcome Taiwan's adoption of the measures necessary to ensure a high level of passport and identity card security, with the introduction of biometric passports, as well as the measures announced to prevent the various Member States of the EU from being treated differently."
"I am very pleased to vote for EU acknowledgement that conditions are in place for the liberalisation of the system of visas to Taiwan."
"In recent decades, Taiwan has seen a manifest process of democratisation and significant economic growth, and today it is in 25th place worldwide."
"The EU and Taiwan maintain economic and trade relations and cooperate in the fields of research, science, technology, education and the environment."
"In view of this, the liberalisation of visas to Taiwan boosts bilateral EU-Taiwan relations, strengthens partnerships in various areas and encourages a reciprocal increase in tourism."
"I voted for this new amendment to Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, which provides for the inclusion of the US Northern Mariana Islands and Taiwan on the white list of countries which have had the visa requirement waived for entering the European Union, as I believe that it provides European citizens with greater freedom of movement."
"At the same time, I hope that Taiwan, in turn, will respect its commitment to remove Romania and Bulgaria from the list of states which are still subject to the visa requirement."
"Anyone who has ever travelled outside the European Union cannot fail to notice how the freedom of movement that we enjoy within the EU has substantially improved our lives."
"The end to internal borders is an important incentive to the mobility of goods and people."
"The ability to travel relatively easily within the Union places all the more importance on our external borders, and on the need to adopt, without compunction, a policy regarding entry into Europe that is adequate, first and foremost, to the needs of the Member States' citizens."
"While we should always treat those seeking entry into our countries humanely and respect their human rights, I believe that the EU is right to thoroughly analyse which countries can be included on the positive list."
"In this respect, the inclusion of Taiwan on the aforementioned list seems reasonable to me, bearing in mind the island's levels of human and economic development, as well as the fact that the rule of law is properly applied there."
"The inclusion of Taiwan on the list of third countries whose nationals are exempt from visas is clear provocation of the People's Republic of China, violating the sovereignty of its institutions over its territory."
"It constitutes a shameless attempt to stoke divisions and a violation of China's territorial integrity."
"Confirmation of this decision will constitute tacit recognition of Taiwan, and will be a violation of international law and the United Nations Charter by the EU, because Taiwan has never been a sovereign state: in fact, this has been repeatedly recognised by the UN General Assembly, which has never accepted the country's participation in the UN."
"In this period of the worsening crisis of capitalism, the majority of this House is once again sending the message that the end justifies the means: in this case, the end is to try to contain China's extraordinary economic development, including by fostering separatism within its borders."
"This is another US-aligned position to have violated China's sovereignty, as also occurred recently when a Member State sold weapons to Taiwan's supposed 'authorities'."
"It is unacceptable that the majority of this House still supports the violation of states' sovereignty and territorial integrity, as happened in the case of Kosovo in relation to Serbia, and as is happening in the case of Southern Sudan in relation to Sudan."
"The European Parliament voted, on 11 November, in favour of transferring Taiwan to the list of third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement to cross the external borders of the Member States, and I strongly welcome the adoption of this resolution."
"Firstly, many other countries in the same geographical zone (Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, South Korea ...) have already benefited, for some time now, from this very visa exemption."
"Then, and most particularly, the liberalisation of visas is an excellent means to encourage links and rapprochement between people, between citizens: students, researchers, simple travellers, etc., and I am convinced that it will promote closer cooperation in the fields of education, culture, research, and even tourism, between the European Union and Taiwan."
"The list of third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas is established on the basis of a careful case-by-case assessment of the situation in the country concerned, taking into account illegal immigration, security issues, the European Union's external relations and the principle of reciprocity."
"Understandably, given that these criteria are likely to change over time, the legislation on the subject provides for a procedure to review the list of countries, so that it is possible to change the number of countries which enjoy exemptions from visa requirements."
"The proposal of Mr DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra, which was approved today, relates to moving the island of Taiwan on to said list."
"Over recent decades, Taiwan has, in fact, undergone a major process of democratisation, which has led it to strike up an important economic and trade relationship with the European Union."
"I therefore believe that today's decision was an important one, which can underline the EU's consistency with recently adopted decisions that have made Taiwan the EU's fourth most important partner in Asia."
"In recent decades, Taiwan has undergone many changes."
"Institutional reforms, the dynamism of civil society and respect for freedoms and civil rights have contributed to political stabilisation in Taiwan."
"In addition, Taiwan is active in many areas at international level, and this includes aid for the victims of natural disasters."
"Taiwan, today, shows high economic growth and low unemployment."
"Since the 1950s, Taiwan has gone through many successful reforms."
"In political terms, Taiwan has completed a process of far-reaching democratisation."
"The changes of the 1980s led to the first democratic elections being held there in 1996."
"The EU and Taiwan maintain economic and commercial relations on a large scale."
"The EU is the biggest foreign investor in Taiwan."
"Taiwan is the EU's fourth largest trading partner in Asia."
"There is also cooperation on research and education, culture and the environment."
"The numbers of illegal immigrants to the EU from Taiwan are very low."
"The citizens of most EU Member States, with the exception of Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria, do not require a visa to enter Taiwan."
"The citizens of these three Member States are also to be included in visa-free travel arrangements in the very near future."
"I am certain that lifting the visa requirement for Taiwanese citizens will contribute to a still greater improvement in commercial relations and relations in the areas of research, education, culture and environment, and to an increase in tourist travel between the EU and Taiwan."
"I voted in favour of this report because the main aim of the proposal is to develop a common policy on immigration, thus helping to strengthen commercial relations between the European Union and Taiwan at the same time."
"After its first democratic elections in 1996, Taiwan embarked upon a major process of democratisation with important institutional reforms for the respect of civil liberties and citizens' rights that have helped to consolidate its political stability."
"From an economic point of view, it has enjoyed significant growth and maintains important economic and commercial ties with the European Union, cooperating in the sectors of research, science, technology, education, culture and the environment."
"The abolition of visas is justified by the low risk of illegal immigration into the European Union of citizens from this island."
"The liberalisation of visas for Taiwan will strengthen our commercial relations and promote closer cooperation in the sectors of culture, education, environment and research, and also encourage an increase in tourism in both directions."
"We owe this to the citizens of Taiwan, partly in the name of regional consistency, because we have already granted exemption from visa obligations to other countries and entities in the same geographical area with a similar level of economic development."
"The criteria established for third countries whose nationals are subject to visa requirements are checked by a case-by-case assessment of the situation in the country in relation to issues such as illegal immigration, public order and security, and of the EU's external relations, regional coherence and the principle of reciprocity."
"The Commission is assisted by the Member States during the process of revising the lists."
"Putting a third country on either the positive list or the negative list is their responsibility."
"The information referred to the Commission by the Member States, along with the valuable data provided by the Centre for Information, Discussion and Exchange on the Crossing of Frontiers and Immigration (CIREFI), help the Commission to come to its conclusions."
"Taiwan's inclusion on the positive list is completely fair and rewards the economic and democratic progress that it has made."
"In this connection, I am disturbed by the fact that relations between Taiwan and China have not been properly regulated."
"By allowing the Taiwanese freely to cross the borders of the EU, we are encouraging an estrangement in relations between China and Taiwan."
"Bearing in mind the fact that China plays an important role in global politics, and that Taiwan remains a 'sore point', we should not be taking premature and ill-considered steps."
"I voted against."
"When it comes to visas from third countries with a visa requirement, it is essential for each individual case to be examined."
"In the past, visas were frequently sold."
"It is important that we stop these scandals and ensure that the Schengen rules are followed."
"The principle of reciprocity should apply to visa requirements, but the example of the USA, which openly uses visa requirements as a threat during negotiations, shows that this is not always the case."
"It is also important to distinguish between the different third countries."
"Taiwan is a special case."
"Until now, it has had relatively good economic growth, which leads the EU to assume that there is a low risk of illegal immigration."
"However, I cannot support putting people without a permanent residence in Taiwan, who do not have identity documents, on an equal footing."
"It is for that reason that I have not voted in favour of this report."
"My fellow Members, I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation because I believe that it is right and appropriate that the island of Taiwan is transferred to the positive list."
"Taiwan is a great partner of the EU in trade terms and has high social standards and a high standard of living, which are very similar to those in the most advanced regions of the EU."
"Liberalising visa requirements for Taiwan will strengthen the trade relationships between the country and the European Union and will facilitate closer collaboration in the sectors of culture, education, environment and research, as well as promoting the growth of tourism in both directions."
"However, as the rapporteur Mr DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra has amply demonstrated, I do not believe that the series of countries listed should be included on the positive list since, unlike Taiwan, these do not have the same standards and requirements."
"I voted in favour as I believe that the inclusion of Taiwan on the list of third countries whose nationals are exempt from visas, the so-called 'positive list', is justified in view of the level of development that Taiwan has achieved in terms of democratic governance, economic growth and education, thus contributing to strengthening trade relations between the European Union and this territory."
"It is also worth pointing out that this measure does not represent increased risks in terms of illegal immigration and public security, while the Taiwanese government's commitment to extend the exemption of visas to all 27 Member States by the end of 2010 should also be emphasised."
"in writing. - We have supported this text, with the main purpose of this amendment of Regulation EC 539/2001 being to exempt holders of Taiwanese passports from visa requirement for entering the EU."
"As was detailed very precisely in the Commission proposal, the principle of the visa exemption is certainly to be supported, given that the level of economic development, education and democratic governance of Taiwan is comparable to the OECD countries in the region - South Korea and Japan."
"After decades of tension, the political climate between the present Taiwanese Government and the People's Republic of China is currently very positive, as the establishment of direct flights and the unprecedented level of cross-Straits business and personal exchanges show, thus providing a window of opportunity for a trouble-free implementation of the measure."
"Taiwan does not represent a threat to the European Union either in terms of illegal immigration (only 45 Taiwanese illegal immigrants have been identified between 2006 and 2008) or in terms of public security."
"As we were informed this morning by the rapporteur, Mr DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra, the Taiwanese authorities have formally exempted all EU citizens from visa obligations."
"I agree with the rapporteur because it is important to develop a common policy on immigration, helping to strengthen commercial relations with Taiwan, which is the European Union's fourth Asian partner and a country marked by political stability and institutional reforms, where civil liberties and citizens' rights are respected."
"I consider the application of this type of assistance to projects in the field of energy essential, especially in a time of crisis, as it stimulates the European economy by creating new jobs."
"I consider the request by Parliament to include assistance to projects in the field of energy efficiency appropriate."
"To some extent, their inclusion makes it necessary to shift the focus from essentially cross-border projects to more regional ones, which will have a wider-ranging impact throughout Europe."
"We must remember that the cost of the necessary initial investment is one of the main problems faced by regional small and medium-sized enterprises when investing in renewable-energy projects, which is mentioned in this regulation."
"The introduction of technical support for implementing these projects is welcome."
"I would also stress the point mentioned by the rapporteur that the budgetary problems of regional authorities in times of crisis must not prevent them accessing the funding."
"As regards the scope of application, I consider the envisaged support for projects relating to decentralised renewable energy sources embedded in local settings and their integration in electricity grids to be equally important."
"Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council established the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR) with a view to contributing to the economic recovery by granting a financial envelope of EUR 3.98 billion for years 2009 and 2010."
"When investment aid in sustainable energy is concentrated at local level, it is most effective and profitable."
"That is why I voted in favour of this text."
"It provides for the creation of a financial instrument designed to support initiatives in energy efficiency and renewable energies which have a rapid, measurable and substantial impact on the economic recovery of the Union, on the strengthening of energy security and on the reduction of greenhouse gases."
"The beneficiaries of this instrument are the public authorities, preferably at local and regional level, and public and private bodies operating on behalf of these public authorities."
"I congratulate the rapporteur for her outstanding work and the encouraging result achieved."
"I voted in favour of this measure because I believe that setting up an ad hoc fund to reduce energy dependency and use renewable and local energy (even if it amounts to only EUR 146 million) represents an important indication for my Parliamentary group on the method to be followed in terms of a shrewder application of the European Union budget."
"I am, in fact, convinced that this financial instrument takes on even greater significance in the light of the financial crisis because it can help businesses recover more effectively and can, in the future, constitute a pilot project for the creation of a more generous energy fund."
"I also believe that the measure is useful in allowing the implementation of projects that will be able to contribute to economic recovery and achieve the energy targets established for combating climate change."
"Prioritising energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies represents an essential step forward."
"Lastly, I hope that the programmes will be fairly distributed in geographical terms and that the entire legal structure (and the composition of the award panel) will be defined more effectively."
"The development of other sources of renewable energy and the promotion of energy efficiency contribute to 'green' growth to ensure a competitive and sustainable economy and in order to combat climate change."
"In supporting these policies, the EU will create new jobs and opportunities in a 'green' market, thus encouraging the development of a competitive, safe and sustainable economy."
"It is crucial to increase public funding with a view to developing energy saving, energy efficiency and renewable energy projects."
"Europe still has to create conditions for more private investment in scientific research, technological development and demonstration in the energy field."
"I would also like to call attention to the fact that the Eighth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development has energy security, the fight against climate change and the environment as its priorities."
"Only in this way will it be possible to maintain the competitiveness of our industry and promote economic growth and job creation."
"in writing. - Conservative MEPs believe that in the current financial and economic climate, proposals for new EU expenditure must be subjected to rigorous scrutiny."
"With regard to this particular instrument, we were concerned in terms of the budgetary principles of the EU budget and of budget discipline."
"However, Conservative MEPs note the potential added value offered by this proposal and its focus on priority policy areas."
"Conservative MEPs can therefore support the compromise proposal as an exception, and in no way setting a precedent."
"The best response to a slump in demand like the one that has affected the world economy in recent years is to stimulate circulation of the existing money supply."
"The public sector is certainly the best place for action to be undertaken to achieve that."
"It is to be hoped, in fact, that this sector will receive a boost, allowing it to make savings by pushing the European economy along a virtuous path of efficient consumption while, at the same time, creating non-relocatable jobs."
"It must be stressed, however, that this provision is very urgently needed."
"According to the forecasts, such a measure could soon, in fact, be seen as just one of many planned for the recovery and thus, it might be given less attention."
"Prompt action would avoid the risk of that happening and, at the same time, it would ensure greater effectiveness."
"Access must be improved for local and regional public authorities to obtain funding for investments in projects for renewable energy resources and energy efficiency."
"I believe that the exchanges of experience between local and regional authorities in Member States are conducive to the development of viable energy efficiency projects, which also respect the commitments for combating climate change."
"However, the European Union must implement the financial mechanisms required to achieve the EU 2020 strategy objectives."
"Overall, I am voting in favour of the proposals presented in this report aimed at the recovery of the European economy through greater financial support for projects in the field of energy."
"I welcome the proposal to channel unspent European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR) appropriations into a new facility supporting energy efficiency as well as into renewable energy projects."
"Through financial incentives, these projects will not only be able to aid the recovery of the European economy, but also enhance security of energy supply and the reduction of greenhouse gases in the EU."
"The possibility of boosting its efficiency through the implementation of funds at local and regional level is another positive aspect of this."
"This will allow the management of 'spill-over effects', such as making local and regional economies more dynamic through small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), social integration or the attractiveness of regions."
"I voted for this report because it advocates the inclusion of assistance measures for projects in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy in the European Energy Programme for Recovery."
"Financing projects in the area of energy efficiency and renewable energy will stimulate economic recovery, create job opportunities and help in the battle against climate change, and may become an important way of responding to the financial crisis."
"The EU's energy dependence is well known, as is the way that the Member States have been attempting to deal with it by diversifying their energy production methods and opting for renewable energy."
"This effort has been dramatically slowed by the emergence of the economic and financial crisis in which we are immersed."
"A programme of awarding Union assistance in the field of energy to promote economic recovery could constitute a means of reversing the recent trend and regaining the initiative, with the aim of increasing the Member States' energy self-sufficiency."
"It is well known that this type of project has particularly large initial costs and that there is a collective advantage in supporting those who take the risk of investing in this area."
"This sector has potential, not just for protecting the environment, but also for creating more jobs in a Europe that wants to be less dependent on the outside world."
"I hope that the programme is fruitful, actually serves the purpose for which it was created, and can avoid bureaucracy and excessive spending."
"I would like to thank the author of the report for an excellent legislative initiative, which I supported, because the financing of projects in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy will help stimulate the economic recovery, create jobs and promote social integration and the attractiveness of the regions."
"These projects are most effective when implemented at municipal, regional and local level, but in duly justified cases, it may be more effective to aim at national level."
"As the current financial and economic crisis and the resulting lower budgetary income are having a particularly adverse effect on the finances of local and regional authorities, it should be ensured that the difficult budgetary situation of those authorities does not hinder them from being able to access the funding."
"I am happy that a short-term economic impact is required, and that the time between receipt of an application for a project and the financial decision should not exceed six months."
"As we know, the EU's dependence on countries supplying oil and gas is increasing."
"In some countries, projects for the renovation of buildings, gas and electricity infrastructure projects, inter-connectors, wind farms, and Carbon Capture and Storage projects (CCS) are taking a long time to move forward."
"Unspent funds from these projects may be allocated to this field."
"The report is particularly relevant for Lithuania, which is becoming increasingly dependent on energy from Russia."
"Therefore, I hope that the government will make every effort to obtain financing and will target financial resources at local level in order to create added value, a direct benefit for citizens, thereby reducing energy poverty."
"I also hope that the report will not drown in red tape."
"Improving the energy efficiency and security are major priorities for the EU."
"The Europe 2020 strategy is highly ambitious with regard to achieving objectives in these areas."
"The use of surplus funds to support projects relating to energy efficiency and renewable energy in the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR) is therefore laudable, especially against a backdrop of financial crisis."
"The emergence of investment projects in these areas is vital for economic growth and a cleaner economy."
"I completely support the notion that we must allocate EUR 146 million to projects in the field of energy."
"This will have a tangible effect if the funds are applied sensibly."
"First, this decision will give the green light to all those who are seeking a significant cost reduction in the manufacturing, transport and transit sectors."
"There will be cost reductions, which means that income will go up and, in turn, by implementing a balanced fiscal policy, EU countries will be able to overcome the consequences of the global financial crisis more swiftly."
"The allocation of EU funds to projects in the field of energy is a good stimulus for the heads of EU governments, local authorities and businesses."
"Research and development are essential to healthy economic growth and are indispensable for achieving the EU's objectives with regard to climate change or increasing energy efficiency."
"This is one of the reasons why research and innovation lie at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"On the one hand, it is important that the regulations on subsidies are clear, in order to prevent abuse as far as possible."
"However, on the other hand, the controls must not result in small businesses and SMEs being indirectly excluded because of the complexity of the subsidy process."
"Therefore, the regulations on subsidies must be reviewed every few years with these points in mind and, wherever possible, must also be simplified."
"The planned review will not meet this requirement, which is why I have voted against it."
"I voted in favour of this report since I believe it is important, particularly at a time of crisis, to support and revitalise the economy, while, at the same time, focusing on sectors that are not yet saturated but instead require development and investment."
"I also agree with the rule that the instrument should be limited to financing measures that have a rapid, measurable and substantial impact on economic recovery within the Union, increased energy security and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions."
"The ongoing structural crisis is, paradoxically, an important opportunity for putting this back on the table."
"The difficulties that the major economic systems have experienced may allow Europe to recover."
"That, however, will require the vision, capacity and courage of a new strategy."
"In the current situation, the only strategy that retains some prospect of success is investing in innovative solutions in order to break with the current technological and scientific paradigms."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe earmarking unused funds under the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR) for the creation of a specific financial instrument to support initiatives on energy efficiency and renewable energy is something worth welcoming."
"In fact, the funding of this type of project, which is completely in line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, makes a key contribution towards the development of a sustainable economy, combating climate change and promoting employment, while also constituting a particularly suitable method given the economic and financial crisis that we are experiencing at present."
"I should like to offer my congratulations on the excellent work carried out by Mrs Van Brempt."
"The amendment to the legislation on the European Energy Programme for Recovery will make it possible to use the available funds to finance projects including: refurbishing public and private buildings to improve energy efficiency or to switch to renewable energy; constructing renewable energy plants and integrating them into electricity grids; developing clean urban public transport solutions, such as electric and hydrogen vehicles; and developing local infrastructure, including efficient street lighting, electricity storage and the provision of smart metering and smart grids."
"Funds will be targeted at supporting local and regional authorities in projects that should prove economically and financially efficient, so as to ensure a return on the investment in good time."
"A total of EUR 146.34 million should be made available from January 2011 to 31 March 2014."
"Contributions received may take the form of loans, guarantees, equities or other financial products."
"Up to 15% of the sums paid out may be used to assist public authorities in preparing the projects, which will be selected partly on the basis of geographical balance."
"In the difficult economic circumstances that we are experiencing, this financial instrument, by enabling EUR 146 million in uncommitted credits to be earmarked for projects in energy saving, energy efficiency and renewable energies between now and 2014, will contribute to supporting growth and encouraging the economic recovery within the European Union, while combating climate change and promoting the protection of the environment."
"I support this provision and vote in favour of the report by my fellow Member, Mrs Van Brempt."
"in writing. - In 2009, the EU adopted a programme to aid economic recovery for Europe (EEPR) by granting EUR 3.98 billion for energy projects by the end of 2010."
"That Community financing was allocated to three sub-programmes in the fields of gas and electricity infrastructure projects, offshore wind electricity projects (OWE), and carbon capture and storage projects (CCS)."
"Thanks to the Greens, we managed to get a provision which would allow to use the uncommitted funds for the creation of a dedicated financial instrument to support energy efficiency and renewable initiatives, in particular in urban settings."
"In order to foster a large number of decentralised investments, municipal, local and regional public authorities will be the beneficiaries."
"In a crisis such as the one we are going through, it is unacceptable to waste the resources that the European Union had made available for supporting energy projects."
"Of the funds earmarked for gas, electricity and wind energy infrastructure, a good EUR 146 million was left unused."
"This measure is designed to release that sum and to fund projects for restructuring and improving the efficiency of homes and public buildings, street lighting and urban transport systems."
"These funds may create new jobs, which will contribute to the development of a competitive and sustainable economy."
"Today's vote sees the establishment of a new and important fund to finance projects in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sector through innovative financial instruments."
"The fund has two aims: promoting energy saving and improvements in the environment and, at the same time, giving fresh impetus to Europe's economic recovery."
"The fund shall finance initiatives and energy projects, adopting a different philosophy from the past, no longer focusing on straight grants, which have many times been shown to be disastrous, but on the profitability of the investment."
"If used well, I believe that this new formula will herald the coming of a new virtuous cycle for the revitalisation of the European economy."
"Furthermore, the new financing instrument represents an important opportunity for the development of local entities, above all, those in the south of Italy."
"In fact, the fund could also be integrated with other European funds, such as the European Regional Development Fund, for example."
"By voting decisively in favour of this new fund, I am expressing my hope that this innovative type of financing could also be extended in the future to many other sectors, starting with road, rail, port and airport infrastructure."
"A commitment to energy efficiency and security is one of the European Union's current priorities."
"The scale of the economic and financial crisis Europe is currently suffering is leading it to seek solutions capable of providing a balanced response to the requirements of the modern world, notably by making use of existing financial resources."
"I welcome the initiative to channel the unused sum of EUR 114 million allocated to the energy sector, as part of the European Energy Programme for Recovery, into initiatives in support of energy efficiency and renewable energy, in the spirit of the EU 2020 strategy."
"The intention is for these new investment projects to contribute to creating jobs and increasing competitiveness in the sector."
"I support the report's stress on the importance of increasing decentralised investments, since the beneficiaries of the initiatives will be public authorities at the various levels of government, whether municipal, regional or national."
"The role of the various parties involved will thus be strengthened and valued, demonstrating the success of the coordination carried out under the Covenant of Mayors."
"I voted for this joint resolution because I consider the transatlantic relationship to be, without doubt, the most important foreign relationship for Europeans."
"At the upcoming EU-US summit, both partners must cooperate on moving forward with a common agenda based on shared values such as the defence of democracy, of the rule of law and of human rights."
"During a period of serious crisis and on the eve of a crucial G20 meeting, the EU and the US, which account for half the world economy between them, must be more committed than ever to working closely together on global economic recovery and on establishing measures for regulating the global financial system."
"Joint action is needed on the great challenges faced by the world - the struggle against climate change, achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the Middle East peace process, the specific situations of Afghanistan and Iraq, and even the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons."
"Such action must be the result of increased strategic dialogue and cooperation between the EU and the US, within the framework of existing multilateral institutions, notably the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and NATO."
"This will contribute to creating solutions."
"The unique relationship that binds the European Union and the United States is one of the strategic foundation stones of the European Union."
"The transatlantic partnership, jointly representing half of the global economy and united by the common values of democracy and human rights, stands moreover as a guarantor of world stability."
"The next EU-United States summit is a crucial juncture in this cooperation."
"I voted for this text as it highlights the challenges that await this collaboration and the obligations that hang over it."
"The revival of the dialogue between our two great powers, and the promotion of multilateral negotiations which characterises the policy of the new Obama administration, accentuate the importance of this text."
"From this perspective, it provides the guidelines for the next summit, particularly in relation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Iranian nuclear issue, nuclear disarmament and the transatlantic security pact."
"Finally, it calls for the Transatlantic Economic Council to be strengthened and highlights the need for the international financial system to be reformed, for cooperation as regards energy, environment, intellectual property and consumer protection to be developed, and for judicial and police cooperation."
"in writing. - (LT) I support this resolution."
"With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union became an important player on the international stage."
"While the EU and the USA remain the strongest forces in the global economy, the serious consequences of the financial and economic crisis have led to the creation of a more integrated transatlantic market, which would create more favourable conditions for economic growth and sustainable social development."
"It is therefore necessary to develop bilateral cooperation as regards the preparation of a joint energy strategy, which would support diversification and security of energy and supply routes, promoting an ecologically efficient economy."
"Furthermore, in creating a new business culture, it is necessary to enhance the use of innovations, creativity and information and communication technologies and increase cooperation in the fields of education, research and science."
"Given that the two partners are committed to cooperating in order to promote growth and jobs in their economies, and that Parliament is continuing to advocate the completion of a transatlantic market by 2015, based on the principle of a social market economy, alongside the completion of the EU's own single market, this will be a key element in newfound growth and global economic recovery."
"I voted in favour of the resolution as I agree that the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) is the most suitable mechanism to manage the transatlantic economic relationship, and that the partners should make the most of the TEC to overcome existing barriers to economic integration and achieve a transatlantic market by 2015, based on the principle of a social market economy, which will act as a positive response to the current economic and social crises."
"I also agree with the call for cooperation within the TEC on all matters affecting the regulatory environment for industries, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), following the approach of the EU 'Small Business Act' when considering legislation with a transatlantic impact."
"The partnership between the United States and the European Union is based on shared history, culture, interests and values, and they also share responsibility for addressing global issues and common challenges."
"With their integrated economies, together they represent around half the global economy: this transatlantic partnership is the main engine of global economic prosperity."
"It is crucial that a consistent joint strategy can be outlined at this summit, with new policies and instruments that can address the new challenges of economic growth and job creation, at a strategic level and in terms of security."
"I hope that the message that comes out of this summit is that the EU and the US must cooperate in an unprecedented way on reforming their markets and financial institutions, learning from the errors of the recent economic and financial crisis, and creating the conditions for recovery and job creation."
"I also call for there to be open dialogue between the parties on how to achieve greater tolerance and respect for diversity in their respective communities, in the context of respect for all fundamental human rights."
"The dominant global position that the United States and the European Union occupy imposes a responsibility that we cannot shirk."
"It is not a matter of defending the positions we have adopted or of vainly trying to obstruct historical processes on the pretext of preserving that dominance."
"It is, rather, a question of asserting the advances in civilisation that have characterised our countries for decades."
"The desire to achieve well-being for our peoples by democratic means - through the free market, more humane working conditions, social systems that work and all the other achievements that make our countries what they are today - counts for much more than a dominant position in an international league table that can provide raw data but not convey emotions or reflect quality of life."
"All that applies not only to the management of global economic relations, but also to more sensitive issues in areas such as foreign policy or environmental policy (together with their implications for industrial and energy policy)."
"Greater coordination today can produce a better world tomorrow, and it is not our intention to give up that ambitious goal."
"The ties that bind the United States and Europe are unique and historical."
"The resolution voted on today in Parliament, which I supported, stresses the importance of ever greater cooperation between our countries, and of continually strengthening our relations, particularly in a context of economic crisis and terrorist threats against the West."
"I also welcome the fact that the monetary issue has been included in the resolution, since it demonstrates our desire to overhaul the international monetary system at a time when currency wars are harming EU growth."
"It is therefore a friendly, but firm, message that we are sending to our transatlantic allies, on the eve of the opening of the G20 summit."
"I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the upcoming EU-US summit and the Transatlantic Economic Council, because I consider it necessary for the current Presidency of the EU to endeavour to achieve an ambitious commitment from the United States at the upcoming CancÃºn summit."
"Greater cooperation from the US is also needed towards more effective reconciliation of its emissions trading quota system and the one implemented by the EU."
"This resolution is quite clear about the goals of the upcoming summit and the announced intensification of the 'strategic dialogue' between the US and the EU."
"The changes that the world is undergoing - the crisis of capitalism, and the emergence of countries with fairly powerful economies, especially Brazil, Russia, India and China: the so called 'BRIC countries' - are a serious threat to the imperialist hegemony."
"The US and the EU are seeking to 'coordinate' strategies, using a panoply of economic, diplomatic and military means to reverse this development."
"The majority in this House are not deviating from their choice of neoliberalism; instead, they are intensifying it, hoping that new steps will emerge from this summit towards greater 'economic integration' and the establishment of the 'transatlantic market'."
"These options tend to lead to greater exploitation of the workers and people, thereby exacerbating economic and social asymmetries between EU countries."
"The military option for ensuring domination of resources markets is gaining dangerously in importance, along with greater 'strategic cooperation' on 'transatlantic security' between the US and the EU within the framework of NATO."
"The people have responded to the choice of exploitation and war with struggle."
"We believe that with the anti-NATO demonstration on 20 November, and the general strike called by the CGTP-IN for 24 November, the Portuguese people will move the struggle against these policies up a gear."
"It is important to make the very best of transatlantic political and economic relations, which have been constantly intensifying over recent years, with effects on the choice of investments and the actions of businesses. I believe that relations between the European Union and the United States can improve still further, as indicated in the joint motion for a resolution, by strengthening economic cooperation and rules regarding the protection of personal data, and asking the United States authorities for greater transparency in terms of their foreign and defence policy."
"It is important that EU-US relations are stepped up, particularly in terms of trade, and that they take account of both shared values and contrasting positions alike, on which a constructive dialogue needs to be developed."
"Overall, I have a positive opinion of the joint motion for a resolution and therefore I shall vote in its favour, in the hope that it provides an impulse for increasing cooperation between these two important players in world politics and economics."
"The European Union and the United States are two areas that have been severely affected by the economic and financial crisis; and, at a time when the effects can still be felt, we have desired to reaffirm, in the European Parliament, our will to find a common response to this crisis and the need to strengthen economic cooperation in order to emerge together definitively from this difficult period."
"I believe that, to this end, the conclusion of a transatlantic market by 2015 is a good way of further developing the economic relationship between our two areas and being stronger in the face of the fits and starts of the global economy."
"Furthermore, as the United States and the EU are old partners which share many values (democracy, respect for human rights), we would like a transatlantic inquiry set up to shed light on suspicions of torture in Iraq."
"Finally, now that the terrorist threat is appearing to get clearer, I hope that the EU and the United States will collaborate fully in this domain, without, however, taking measures that might be too intrusive of the private lives of individuals."
"That is the point we wished to make now that the forthcoming summit between the EU and United States is approaching."
"in writing. - I supported the resolution on the Transatlantic Economic Council, except some amendments advanced by the ALDE."
"I would take this opportunity to call on both transatlantic partners to use fully and without delays the potential of the Transatlantic Economic Council."
"This latter will become a crucial instrument to overcome the still existing barriers for free trade and to realise the Transatlantic free trade market within the next five years."
"Only such a market, advocated by the European Parliament on several occasions, can be the basis for a long-term and reliable US-EU cooperation."
"Politically, the US and Europe should make determined efforts to agree on a common agenda for dealing with global challenges."
"in writing. - The EU-US relationship is one of the most important relationships that the EU has."
"It is such a major trading partner that anything that would help us move and work closer together is very welcome."
"I welcome the resolution calling for the settling of differences between the two trading blocs over issues such as the visa waiver and PNR."
"This resolution also calls for better convergence of financial reforms on both sides of the Atlantic, which I feel is very important to avoid any future crisis like the one that we are currently experiencing from happening again."
"in writing. - (FR) I endorsed the resolution in which the European Parliament presents its recommendations to the Council on the way in which transatlantic issues should be addressed at the forthcoming EU-US summit."
"Given the weight the European Union and the United States carry in the global economy, and the current economic situation, it seems crucial for the two partners to step up their cooperation in order to promote growth and jobs."
"That is why I endorsed, in particular, the two oral amendments tabled by my colleague, Mr Brok, which stressed the need for better coordination of monetary policies within the context of transatlantic relations."
"Those two amendments should be considered in conjunction with the debate that is beginning within the G20 on the risks posed to all the world's economies by the 'currency war' and any national monetary initiatives that could throw exchange rates out of balance."
"All 'competitive devaluations' and all 'competitive undervaluations' should be avoided, because they harm necessary international economic and monetary cooperation."
"The resolution on transatlantic relations as adopted is a plea for a special relationship with the United States."
"An economic special relationship via the creation of a transatlantic market between now and 2015 and a political one with the aim of 'defending a common cause'."
"This common cause includes increased cooperation in Afghanistan, far more intensive integration with North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) missions and submission to American demands to share bank data of European citizens via the SWIFT agreement."
"Regarding the draft agreement between the European Union and the US on personal data protection in relation to the transfer and processing of data within the framework of police and judicial cooperation, we should ask one fundamental question: whether both sides have a balanced interest in the agreement."
"In my opinion, this is not the case, as the interest of the US in obtaining data on EU citizens comes first."
"If we look more closely at the differences between the systems of both parties for protecting personal data, we soon see that it is almost impossible to conclude an agreement of this kind - if we are to uphold the standards of personal data protection provided for in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU."
"It is, moreover, absolutely essential that, prior to the negotiations on such an agreement between the EU and the US, regulations be adopted on the protection of private individuals in the processing of personal data by bodies, institutions and other organisations of the EU and the Member States, as set out in Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"The only virtue of this resolution is that it recommends the universal abolition of the death penalty and calls on the United States to accede to the International Criminal Court."
"Aside from that, it is unacceptable."
"How can Parliament declare itself in favour of the completion of the large transatlantic market, that colossal project carried out behind the European public's back?"
"How can it welcome the SWIFT agreement, the transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data, the Open Skies agreement between Europe and the United States, greenhouse gas emission allowance trading and the anti-democratic institutions that are behind the Multidisciplinary Group on International Action against Terrorism (GMT)?"
"I voted against this betrayal of the general interest and democracy."
"The EU-US relationship is based on a shared commitment to democracy, to the rule of law and human rights, to combating terrorism, and to preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; these are our shared interests and values."
"We cannot forget that the EU and US represent almost half the global economy: it is the most integrated and longest-lived economic relationship in the world, and the main engine of global economic prosperity."
"The strength of the transatlantic relationship and commitment to it are taking on even greater importance in the face of the current international financial and economic crisis."
"This gives this summit the utmost importance in strengthening these relationships even further, so that the goals advocated for 2015 can be achieved."
"The resolution on the forthcoming EU-US summit and the Transatlantic Economic Council is designed to reaffirm the transatlantic agenda and to strengthen EU-US cooperation on matters of common interest."
"This relationship remains a major priority for the European Union."
"Besides the fact that the EU and the United States share a number of common interests and values, such as the promotion of peace, democracy, respect for human rights, and the market economy, they have the world's most important bilateral trade and investment relationship: the transatlantic economy is worth USD 4 280 billion."
"Our reality is one of ever closer economic integration."
"The full importance of this relationship can also be seen in the context of development cooperation, given that together, the United States and the European Union provide almost 80% of development aid."
"Lastly, our partnership is vital for making the world a more stable place and for discussing major multilateral issues, such as climate change, energy, the economic and financial crisis, crisis management, development cooperation, regional matters, non-proliferation and disarmament, and security."
"in writing. - (LT) The EU and the USA have many points of contact and are playing a dominant role in solving global problems."
"However, we must learn good practice from each other and strengthen our partnership in order to ensure the effectiveness of actions."
"These problems are relevant as far as climate change, a healthy environment and food security are concerned."
"The huge ecological disaster in the Gulf of Mexico offered hope that the US Government will take appropriate steps to ensure care for the environment and work towards solving the challenges of climate change."
"The EU must play an active role at the Climate Change conference in CancÃºn."
"It is important for the USA to become part of this agreement because sometimes, there is the impression that it would be easier to reach an agreement with developing countries than with the USA."
"We must find ways of promoting links between the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and regional or federal trading schemes in the US."
"We must also seek a transatlantic partnership on strategic energy issues - on security of energy supply and policies to move towards low carbon energy sources."
"One issue of transatlantic cooperation concerns a healthy environment - novel foods and the use of new technologies in food production."
"EU society is not completely prepared for innovations, so countries must respect each other's choices."
"A strong EU-US partnership must be beneficial to both sides and in a global context."
"I hope that the forthcoming EU-US summit will represent a step towards this goal."
"The motion for a resolution includes some positive points and the EU should attempt to strengthen its position in these areas, such as combating the global economic and financial crisis and cooperating on transport and industry."
"On the other hand, the motion still has some deficiencies regarding foreign and security policy, in particular, with regard to the fight against international terrorism."
"Therefore, I have abstained from voting."
"I voted in favour of the resolution since I believe it to be a fair and balanced document."
"It is important for Parliament to make its opinion heard on this important summit with our greatest ally."
"Transatlantic relations have always been a crucial part of European foreign policy."
"Even in a globalised world, in which some experts see the axis shifting from the west towards the powers of the east, I am still firmly convinced that the EU-US relationship is pivotal to stability, growth and prosperity, not only on both sides of the Atlantic, but throughout the world."
"We have strong roots in common; we share culture, lifestyles, outlooks and markets; and, most of all, we have always been the standard bearers for values, ideals and needs, whether ideological, economic or social, which have cast us in a leading role on the world stage."
"On account of the new global scenario and balance of power, however, I think we need to make our collaboration with Washington more operational, and for the EU to assert itself as a credible partner, it is vital to put across not just an image of cohesion but also the ability to take on concrete commitments."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, as I believe that:"
"the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) constitutes the most appropriate mechanism for managing the transatlantic economic relationship and that the partners should use the TEC to its full potential to overcome the existing barriers to economic integration and realise a transatlantic market by 2015, which will constitute a positive response to the current economic and social crises;"
"the TEC should be more strategic, in order to respond to the concerns of the interested parties;"
"the approach of the Small Business Act should be monitored whilst it is considered legislation with a transatlantic impact;"
"the economic and financial governance structures existing at the start of the crisis, at international level and at US and EU level, did not provide the international financial system with sufficient stability, so it is understood that increasing economic and financial interdependence makes it important to strengthen cooperation between the leading economies in the areas of macro-economic policy and supervision."
"I also welcome the call for the EU and US to cooperate with China on resolving the international dispute over exchange rates without applying protectionist or retaliatory measures, also taking into account the fact that the market pressures to which EU Member States are subjected are different to those experienced by the US, especially as regards sovereign obligations and the existence of monetary union."
"The relationship linking Europe and the United States is unique and historic."
"The resolution adopted today in the European Parliament - which I voted for - underlines the importance of strengthening cooperation and intensifying strategic dialogue between the EU and the US in the context of the economic and financial crisis, as well as of combating the terrorist threat."
"Given the importance of international issues at the present time, it is, in fact, essential to appeal to shared principles, interests and values, so that decisive steps can be taken at the upcoming EU-US summit towards advancing a wide-ranging common agenda that enables these challenges to be tackled effectively."
"It is also essential for the potential of the Transatlantic Economic Council to be fully exploited in order to overcome the existing barriers to establishing the transatlantic market by 2015, as well as to promote an integrated approach in the field of supervision and macro-economic policy, and in the area of the trade relationships of the EU and the US with third countries."
"Transatlantic relations are essential for Europe and I endorsed this resolution on the future priorities for the forthcoming EU-US summit."
"Regarding global governance in particular, efforts aimed at implementing the UN reform agenda should intensify."
"In addition, it is crucial to reach an ambitious and binding system for the period after 2012 on greenhouse gas emissions."
"Furthermore, in terms of financial stability, the comparability of accounting standards on a global scale is vital and progress must be made towards this."
"Moreover, regulatory standards introduced in one area should serve as a reference for other areas, thereby producing an ever increasing density of international financial regulation."
"in writing. - I abstained at the final vote."
"Among other things, one of the main positive aspects (on which not all our group agree) of this resolution that should be emphasised is in paragraph 29, where the EP states that the international undertakings given regarding the MDGs, the achievement of many of which is lagging behind schedule, can only be honoured if the industrialised countries maintain their commitments and set aside 0.7% of their GDP for overseas development aid by 2015."
"Parliament calls, therefore, on the EU and the US, and on other international donors, to honour their commitments and to take measures to speed up progress towards meeting the MDG targets by 2015;"
"in writing. - The relationship between the UK and other European countries with the US will continue to be our most important strategic priority for decades to come."
"In some areas of activity, the EU may also be able to make a useful contribution."
"I therefore supported the resolution on EU-US relations."
"However, I remain unconvinced about the value of CSDP and the policy towards Iran needs to be strengthened."
"Security requirements for air transport have led the EU to sign, with different States, agreements for exchanging Passenger Name Record data (PNR data)."
"Furthermore, the Treaty of Lisbon makes the Charter of Fundamental Rights binding, thereby protecting European citizens' personal information."
"When it comes to renewing these exchange agreements, Parliament will have to approve any new agreement negotiated."
"There are two conflicting requirements on this issue."
"On the one hand, the fight against organised crime and terrorism, fostered by new communication media, and, on the other, the protection of privacy and of fundamental freedoms which these same communication media are jeopardising."
"I thought it important to offer my support to this text that perpetuates transatlantic cooperation against organised crime and terrorism, while devoting a large part to the guarantees necessary for European citizens' freedoms."
"in writing. - (LT) I support this resolution."
"Acts of terrorism that have shocked the globe and growing organised crime in the areas of drug and human trafficking demand improved efforts to combat crime and terrorism."
"For such actions to work, they must go hand in hand with more effective, focused and faster exchanges of data both within Europe and globally."
"However, the main problem remains the issue of the protection of personal data, ensuring that such data is not used for any purpose other than preventing, investigating or detecting criminal offences."
"In my opinion, the Commission must ensure that any agreement or measure on the transfer of personal data must also stand the legal proportionality test and protect the confidentiality of personal data."
"As an institution representing citizens, in this process, the European Parliament must be informed by the Commission of all issues relating to the transfer of personal data, so that it might express its position on planned agreements."
"In this way, we will be able to find optimal solutions so that our citizens' data is only used according to strictly regulated rules and the protection of their personal data is guaranteed."
"Parliament aims to enhance data protection in the transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to institutions in third countries."
"It is very important for the use of personal data to be effective, for the use of information to be sufficiently flexible, and for it also to allow people's privacy to be protected."
"Parliament calls for the preparation of a standard passenger data model and for guarantees that data will be transferred and processed for the purpose of preventing, investigating, detecting or prosecuting criminal offences, including terrorism."
"It is very important for PNR data not to be used for data mining or profiling and for data review not to simply be entrusted to an electronic system, but for decisions to be taken by people."
"With this in mind, it is very important to cooperate and exchange information with competent, independent institutions in order to ensure they make effective and independent decisions on the transfer of personal data."
"For the purpose of combating terrorism, every citizen is a potential terrorist and, as a result, their personal data are recorded, in breach of basic human rights and institutional guarantees to ensure they are respected."
"Unfortunately, the amendments proposed by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left that would have improved things somewhat were rejected."
"That is why I voted against the motion."
"Freedom is one of the cardinal principles on which this House is based."
"This value is the foundation on which the European institutions are built, the power source that enables the market to drive a varied and complex economy, and the air that our citizens breathe as they travel to study or work in cities that once were places that they needed a passport and even a visa to reach."
"There is no question, therefore, as to its importance."
"The issue highlighted by this document is, rather, its relationship to security."
"There is no easy solution to this problem."
"The information must, in fact, be collected and analysed in the right places, but we have to remain watchful to prevent abuse."
"The checks on this procedure must be continual and constant and must prevent any leakage of data."
"We cannot allow people to see this as wanting to cast freedom aside, just as we cannot allow pressure for freedom to endanger the security of the people of Europe."
"In my view, the document puts forward an excellent compromise to balance these two opposing principles."
"I welcome the adoption of the European Parliament resolution on the global approach to transfers of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to third countries, and on the recommendations from the Commission to the Council to authorise the opening of negotiations between the European Union and Australia, Canada and the United States, which I voted for."
"This is an approach which strikes the right balance between European Union Member States' security requirements and strict respect for citizens' rights and freedoms."
"The passenger name record is an extremely sensitive database which therefore needs to be protected to prevent any kind of damage being caused to those whose names feature in it."
"I feel it is important for us to ensure, as part of the agreement negotiations with the US, Australia and Canada, that the data cannot be used to create profiles by extracting certain data from the record."
"I agree that there is a difference between evaluating security risks and creating profiles which may prove to be false, based on misinterpretation of the data."
"I hope that the agreements which the Commission is going to negotiate with the relevant countries will meet the resolution's requirements."
"In the current digital era, data protection, the right of informational self-determination, personal rights and the right to privacy have become values which play a vital role and must be protected with special care."
"Given this fact, I believe that the EU must respect and promote a key principle in data protection policies, and that any agreement or policy measure must also stand the legal proportionality test, demonstrating that it aims to achieve treaty objectives."
"I voted broadly in favour of what this motion for a resolution proposes."
"In the name of combating and preventing the global threat of terrorism and other forms of transnational crime, I welcome this initiative and the spirit of cooperation and commitment between the EU, the United States, Australia and Canada."
"Nevertheless, I consider proportionality to constitute a fundamental principle of data protection policy."
"Therefore, the agreements' objective of ensuring that the transfer of data is in line with European data protection standards must be studiously respected and defended."
"I would also stress the importance of opening negotiations on a personal data transfer and protection agreement with the US, in the context of expanded political and legal cooperation."
"However, I would reiterate that necessity and proportionality are fundamental and basic principles in ensuring the effective combating of terrorism."
"The transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data is an important element in the fight against terrorism and transnational crime."
"However, the number of countries requesting transfers of PNR data by airlines is steadily increasing, and so close monitoring is required to ensure that European citizens' personal information is not used for purposes other than those for which it was collected and that its transfer is in line with European data protection standards."
"I therefore fully support the resolution adopted today by the European Parliament, which is aimed at providing a strict framework for the transfer of passenger data to third countries."
"Those countries will have to offer guarantees as to the use, storage and collection of such data, which should prevent their abuse and ensure that our citizens' rights are respected."
"In order to ensure the continued security of international transport, especially in the face of the risk posed by terrorism, it is vital for countries to be able to exchange information on passengers - PNR data, collected by airlines."
"However, it is just as vital to ensure that these provisions do not jeopardise citizens' fundamental freedoms or result in some people being discriminated against because of their origin or religion."
"That is why the protection of personal data must be guaranteed better."
"The European Parliament has one clear demand to make before the Commission starts negotiating the methods of exchanging PNR data with the United States, Canada and Australia: the protection of personal data is too sensitive a subject for these negotiations to be conducted exclusively among Member States, behind closed doors."
"They must be conducted transparently, at EU level."
"The data transferred must be used only within a strictly defined context and must not be transferred to a third country."
"Many types of information will have to be excluded from the data that can be collected, in particular, that information in connection with ethnic origin and religious beliefs."
"The protection of personal data is a sensitive issue in EU-US relations, as in the case of the agreement on the transfer of banking data (SWIFT agreement)."
"A general EU-US agreement on data protection is currently under discussion, as well as a new agreement on the exchange of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data."
"Through today's vote on the joint resolution, Parliament has reiterated its demand that PNR information gathered should not, under any circumstances, be used for exploitation or profiling purposes."
"Finally, Parliament once again calls on the Commission to provide factual evidence that 'collecting, storing and processing PNR data is necessary' and also invites the Commission to 'envisage less intrusive alternatives'."
"If Parliament is not heeded, it will have the chance to use its right of veto."
"I voted for this report because I think that the European Union needs to have a coherent, uniform vision with regard to signing future PNR agreements."
"This will help ensure better protection for personal data and privacy, while also promoting the use of this data for combating terrorism and major cross-border crime."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because I consider the recommendation from the Commission to the Council to authorise the opening of negotiations on agreements between the European Union and Australia, Canada and the United States on the transfer and use of Passenger Name Record data to be important."
"These agreements should ensure that the determination to fight terrorism and criminality will not call into question the protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights, not least the rights to privacy, informational self-determination and data protection."
"Personal data, their protection and the individual right to this same protection are subjects that have increasingly been attracting interest from political decision makers and civil society itself."
"The available technological means constitute a significant challenge to respect for individual privacy."
"This concept, too, has been called into question by the increasing voluntary and involuntary exposure to which Europeans are now subjected."
"Europeans are also encountering the growing tension between the individual's right to privacy and the collective right to security."
"All these issues have taken on worrying proportions since 11 September 2001 and remain current."
"Terrorism and other forms of organised crime are fought today with rapid and effective information exchanges between security agencies, rather than by conventional police forces."
"Without these exchanges, we would be exposed to concerted, cross-border criminal activity, with no chance of responding appropriately."
"For all these reasons, I believe that it is essential to open negotiations with our partners, so that we can face collective dangers together, and to ensure that the data exchanged between the parties comply with the principles of appropriateness and proportionality to the intended purposes."
"This resolution follows the dynamic created by the United States with regard to fighting the 'threat from terrorism', and so seeks to tie the Member States of the European Union to this same dynamic."
"Instead of fighting the underlying causes of the problem, they are seeking to use this threat as a pretext for unacceptable restrictions on Europeans' rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"Those responsible for this capitulation by the European Parliament, which goes against positions taken in the past, are now seeking to nuance it by referring to alleged principles of 'proportionality' and 'necessity', which are always debatable and subjective to assess."
"The argument that there are Passenger Name Record data now that are already being transferred to third countries without any sort of checks does not hold."
"If data are being used or processed improperly, it must be investigated, reported and fought robustly."
"This resolution represents a capitulation that seeks only to cloak in legality something that is clearly on the fringes of it at the moment."
"I voted for the resolution on the comprehensive strategy pertaining to transferring air passenger data to third countries, for it is necessary to lay down a binding legal framework to these transfers which are increasingly being used as part of the fight against terrorism."
"In the course of preparing this negotiation with the USA, Canada and Australia, Parliament has laid down conditions."
"Among other things, we request that data should not be used for profiling purposes and that the negotiations should be conducted with full transparency in relation to Parliament."
"Moreover, MEPs must be allowed to monitor this situation closely."
"The protection of privacy is a sensitive issue, which should not be sacrificed for the sake of another requirement, that of combating terrorism."
"As it did in the negotiation of the SWIFT agreement, Parliament will succeed in safeguarding citizens' privacy."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on the EU's external strategy on Passenger Name Record data (PNR data), since I believe that concluding agreements permitting the transfer of PNR data between the European Union and Canada, the United States and Australia is of paramount importance to international security."
"I therefore welcome the Commission's recommendation for negotiations to be opened with a view to concluding these agreements."
"Indeed, it has been evident for several years now that exchanging these data helps in the fight against terrorism and international crime."
"These international transfers of PNR data offer our countries' law enforcement agencies precious means of combating the terrorist threat."
"Furthermore, I must stress that the new global approach to PNR data presented by the Commission in October and aimed at establishing general criteria specific to all PNR agreements is very positive in my view."
"It will create a more structured and more coherent framework for these agreements, and will provide significant guarantees in terms of the protection of personal data."
"This resolution completely contradicts the one adopted by this House in May."
"It 'welcomes' the proposal made by the Commission in September."
"That proposal endorses the transfer of PNR data to third countries and contains no satisfactory guarantee as to the way in which the data will be used."
"What is worse, it considers it justifiable to store these data for an unlimited period of time for profiling purposes."
"What is the point of this resolution's self-righteous railing against a practice that is at the heart of a project it supports?"
"I voted against this resolution, which violates every human being's right to have his or her personal data respected."
"Passenger Name Records (PNR) are another weapon in the fight against terrorism."
"Under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has to help set out a new external strategy regarding the negotiation of a new PNR agreement between the EU, the USA, Australia and Canada."
"As a great advocate of the fight against terrorism, the EU is prepared to negotiate any agreement that may be effective in this fight."
"The Union will not, however, endanger civil liberties and fundamental rights."
"I fully support the objective of preventing and combating terrorism and other serious transnational crime."
"More and more countries are using passenger data for this purpose."
"In the digital age, however, it is crucial to pay particular attention to the enforcement and protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights, including the right to privacy and data protection."
"The key principles that must be prioritised in this area are necessity and proportionality."
"The collection of passenger data must not just be useful; it must be necessary too."
"The principle of proportionality must also be invoked to prevent the planned measures from going above and beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives set."
"There can be no question, therefore, of using the data for the purposes of exploitation or profiling."
"Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has made a major contribution to the efforts to conclude these agreements, and therefore it must be fully and regularly informed of any developments relating to PNR data."
"In recent years, fundamental rights have increasingly been curtailed as part of the so-called war on terror."
"The rationale behind this is extremely questionable."
"While passengers are searched almost down to their underwear and are not allowed to carry nail files or deodorant in their luggage, checks on freight are often left to the shipping companies themselves."
"If this is to change in future, it is important that the balance between freedom and security is preserved."
"In the case of passenger security checks, this balance has already been lost and, therefore, as the hysteria surrounding terrorism subsides, the regulations will once again be relaxed."
"Just as questionable is the issue of whether the FBI needs to know the name, address, e-mail address, credit card number and number of suitcases of people travelling to the USA and whether it should be permitted to store this data for up to 15 years."
"The information should only need to be kept in a few exceptional cases."
"If fundamental rights are infringed in order to create a sense of security, the infringement must be as limited as possible and the rights of those affected must be reinforced."
"Unfortunately, this is unlikely to happen at the moment and, therefore, I have voted against the motion."
"It is true that evaluating and processing Passenger Name Record (PNR) data at an international level can help in combating terrorism and organised crime."
"However, agreements of this kind often cause problems with regard to data protection."
"Therefore, the European Parliament must take a consistent approach on this issue (in a similar way as in the case of SWIFT), in order to protect the fundamental rights of EU citizens."
"There are currently a number of regulations governing the transfer of PNR data to third countries with which the EU has concluded agreements. The more countries which demand this data, the greater the risk that the different systems will have a negative impact on legal clarity, the protection of personal data and the costs for airlines."
"Therefore, the EU must put in place uniformly high security standards, which will guarantee a coherent approach in future."
"This is what I expect from an efficient EU foreign policy strategy for the transfer of PNR data."
"This motion for a resolution does not guarantee this and I have therefore voted against it."
"I endorse the objectives that the Commission proposes in its communication."
"The reasons that make it necessary and useful to use and exchange Passenger Name Record (PNR) data with third countries for security purposes need to be made transparent and understandable."
"At the same time, the parties involved need to show that they are fully aware of the implications that such actions may have on private life and of the need for them to be carried out under a set of uniform, explicit and strict data protection rules, which must be enforced even when data are transferred to other countries."
"The use and exchange of PNR data will not only improve people's security, but also facilitate their lives and their movements across borders."
"With PNR data, police checks can be considerably reduced and surveillance can be focused on those passengers for whom there is a well-founded reason to believe that they might pose an actual risk, thus sparing the others pointless checks and inspections."
"The European Parliament voted in plenary today in favour of a joint motion for a resolution on the renegotiation of PNR agreements and the adoption of strict data transmission criteria, in order to achieve passenger safety predicated, as always, on respect for personal data."
"The main objective is to collate, transmit and process PNR data on a restricted basis, so that they cannot be used for data mining or profiling."
"I voted for the motion for a resolution on Passenger Name Record data as part of the European Union's foreign strategy because, by establishing a series of basic common principles for agreements with third countries, it safeguards European data protection standards."
"At the same time, this motion for a resolution meets the objectives of compliance with the law and strengthening of security, not least the fight against terrorism."
"Simultaneously, the European Parliament is reiterating its demand to be kept informed about all the relevant developments in this field, and is playing an active part, which is its prerogative."
"Combating terrorism and other forms of transnational and organised crime is impossible without data exchange that is more effective, more guided and faster, both within Europe and at international level."
"This makes it essential that the security measures adopted do not compromise the protection of civil liberties and fundamental freedoms, or the greatest possible respect for private life and data protection."
"In accordance with the principle of proportionality, therefore, it will be important to ensure that only data indispensable for security purposes are collected and processed."
"in writing. - Several groups agreed on this text that basically recalls Parliament's determination to fight terrorism and organised and transnational crime, and, at the same time, its firm belief in the need to protect civil liberties and fundamental rights, including the rights to privacy, informational self-determination and data protection."
"Parliament reaffirms that necessity and proportionality, as set out in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, are key principles in ensuring effectiveness in the fight against terrorism."
"It welcomes the Commission communication on the global approach to transfers of PNR data to third countries and welcomes the recommendation from the Commission to the Council to authorise the opening of negotiations for agreements between the EU and Australia, Canada and the USA for the transfer and use of PNR data to prevent and combat terrorism and other serious transnational crime."
"It also welcomes the decision of the Council to start all negotiations simultaneously, while acknowledging that the length of the negotiations may vary."
"On 21 September 2010, the European Commission presented its global approach to transfers of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to third countries."
"The purpose of transferring and processing data, such as ticket information, seat number, luggage details, route and payment type, is to prevent, investigate, detect or prosecute criminal offences, including terrorism, within the framework of police and judicial cooperation on criminal matters."
"This 'global approach' is intended to act as a guideline for future negotiations with third countries."
"Negotiations with the USA, Canada and Australia will be opened shortly and other states have expressed similar intentions."
"The European Parliament's motion for a resolution confirms once again the importance of the principle of proportionality."
"The needs of security and freedom are in a delicate balance."
"We are calling on the Commission to provide factual evidence that the collection, storage and processing of PNR data is necessary for each of the stated purposes and to carry out an adequate investigation into possible alternatives."
"The European Parliament maintains its position that PNR data must not, under any circumstances, be used for data mining or profiling."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution on innovation partnerships because I consider them an essential element of the actions committed to as part of this flagship initiative."
"In the current climate of austerity in public budgets, of significant demographic change and of ever increasing competition at global level, Europe's competitiveness and, above all, our future standard of living, depend on our ability to integrate innovation into products, services, companies, and social processes and models."
"I therefore consider it crucial that innovation has been put at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Innovation is our best means of tackling the major social challenges that we are facing, such as climate change, energy and resource shortages, or health and ageing."
"It is essential that the responses that are found to these challenges help to create a Europe that is fair from the economic, social and environmental sustainability points of view."
"I welcome the 'Innovation Union' initiative, whose goal is to integrate Europe in innovation terms by cooperating in a well-coordinated way at regional, national and European level."
"I applaud the European innovation partnerships, which are an innovative concept aimed at creating synergies between existing initiatives and, potentially, new European and Member State initiatives in the field of innovation."
"I welcome the proposed theme for this first pilot partnership: active and healthy ageing."
"Some of the most serious social challenges faced by Europe, such as the ageing population, require radical innovation that cuts across several sectors."
"Responding to ageing requires changes at all levels, from the right to work and pensions, to new service models, including self-administered care and new types of accommodation."
"The struggle against new risks and inequalities requires innovative approaches in the social field, not just through implementing new technology, but also through innovative organisations."
"I call on the Commission to guarantee funding for the partnerships, bringing together the resources of the European Union, the Member States, the regions, and other public and private actors for this purpose, following clear and transparent criteria."
"Full advantage must be taken of Europe's innovation potential."
"This cannot be merely a statement of principle, and I am delighted that we have finally arrived at a proposal like the one in question."
"Many efforts and ideas which, by themselves, remain in the abstract, can now be part of a system and can be brought to fulfilment to meet specific needs."
"The topics are highly pertinent today, and every effort must be made to ensure that all relevant players take part."
"I particularly welcome the reduction in red tape and the active involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are packed with innovative energy that just needs to be released to benefit the whole Union."
"I just hope that the programme will be implemented appropriately."
"The European Parliament resolution on European Innovation Partnerships within the Innovation Union flagship initiative is a specific initiative aimed at devising an integrated European innovation policy."
"What makes it all the more important is that we need to acknowledge that we have not achieved all our objectives included in the Lisbon Programme from 2000."
"Indeed, innovation and the expansion of the R&D sector must be one of the drivers of future economic growth."
"I welcome the introduction of the innovative concept of European Innovation Partnerships, which is intended to generate synergy between current innovation initiatives."
"We will have to monitor closely how the first pilot programme in this area progresses because it deals with a theme which is of concern to the whole of Europe: the impact of an ageing population and extending working life."
"I voted to adopt this resolution, while also taking into account the further themes which will be dealt with after the pilot project has been assessed."
"These are themes of general interest."
"I voted for this resolution because I believe that the principle of innovation partnerships in the public and private sectors can boost research and innovation activities and help revive demand during the crisis."
"They also have an important role in achieving the Europe 2020 strategy objectives in terms of creating a more competitive economy and a fairer, greener society."
"European innovation partnerships are an innovative concept aimed at creating synergies between existing initiatives and, potentially, new European and Member State initiatives in the field of innovation, as well as maximising and accelerating the delivery of results and benefits to society."
"They are, therefore, an important tool at a time when the Member States are struggling with important economic issues, where I believe a commitment to innovation could be an effective strategy."
"I welcome the proposed theme for this first pilot partnership: active and healthy ageing."
"While the European population is ageing and this is seen as a negative factor, it is important for Europe to be able to make good use of its human capital, especially people who are older and therefore have more experience and often important knowledge to pass on."
"in writing. - The concept of the European Innovation Partnership is a vital part of the commitments under the flagship initiative."
"The group which I am part of in the European Parliament, the S&D, wholly endorses the 'Active and Healthy Ageing' pilot European Innovation Partnership and puts forward suggestions for two additional partnerships in the areas which would benefit urgently from the created value added."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I was pleased to hear the results of today's vote on the motion for a resolution on innovation partnerships."
"I think that work on this document has led to the development of an unequivocal and ambitious position."
"The Innovation Union initiative is very important and is, at the present time, the most concrete attempt at an integrated European innovation policy."
"I would like to emphasise that it is important to take account of the Europe 2020 strategy in our work, because Europe 2020 includes an increase in attention to research, innovation and education in the future."
"Innovation is one of the engines of the economy and will make a decisive contribution to realising the EU 2020 strategy. The partnerships advocated here could be influential in this respect, since they create very important synergies for maximising and accelerating innovation processes."
"It also seems important to me that the pilot project is dedicated to the area of active and healthy ageing, since the ageing of Europe's population is the undeniable reality."
"The EU must also continue to support other areas of innovation despite the financial crisis through which we are living, as without it, we will not successfully realise the ambitious objectives already set out for the EU in the EU 2020 strategy."
"The Innovation Union is an innovation strategy which is being promoted at the highest political level."
"It is one of the central initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The idea behind it is to enable us to meet future challenges, such as climate change, energy and food security, health and an ageing population, in an appropriate way and to raise them to a transnational level."
"The result will be to allow blockages caused by financing problems, fragmented research systems and markets, inadequate support for innovation in public contracts and slow standardisation to be managed more effectively."
"I have voted in favour of the resolution because a joint concept, such as that of innovative partnerships, will bring benefits for every Member State."
"The benefit of the new concept of innovation partnerships lies in the clear-cut scope and spheres of responsibility for the various partners involved."
"It also includes precise deadlines for the implementation of individual projects, together with measurable and achievable targets."
"In addition, it offers simplified administrative procedures for implementing projects and improving the dissemination of research findings."
"Therefore, I have voted in favour of this report."
"I voted for this resolution because I believe that in the current climate, innovation partnerships constitute an important instrument in building a Europe that is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable."
"I also welcome the choice of subject for the first partnership: active and healthy ageing."
"in writing. - With the adoption of this text, Parliament states that the Innovation Union initiative is the most significant to date and a concrete attempt at an integrated European innovation policy, whose success depends upon well-coordinated cooperation at regional, national and European level, with the maximum involvement of all relevant players at each level."
"The European Innovation Partnerships represent an innovative concept aiming to create synergies between existing and, where necessary, new European and Member State initiatives in the field of innovation and maximise and accelerate the delivery of results and benefits to society."
"Parliament therefore welcomes the first proposed topic for European Innovation Partnership, on active and healthy ageing, and the suggested approach by the Commission to first run a pilot project testing the most suitable format for these partnerships before launching any further ones, and calls on the Commission, when running the first pilot project on active and healthy ageing, to include social innovation which leads to a better quality of life, prevents disease, improves social networks within public sectors and among social partners, and promotes the introduction of new technologies supporting the quality of life."
"At the present time, when we are coming out of the crisis and are standing before the new challenges which await the EU after 2013, innovation is one of the most important ways - if not the most important way - to consolidate the EU's position in the world."
"Innovative use of resources may prove to be one of the best methods for eliminating disparities between states or regions."
"It will also contribute to preserving the diversity of these areas by using good practices and the experience of other parties."
"The development of new types of production or services and the innovative use of resources will contribute to the rational and effective development of local, regional and national markets."
"Innovation is human creativity."
"By looking for innovative solutions, we contribute to an increase in the well-being of society."
"At a time when the economy, technology and information science are undergoing dynamic development, we must not forget the most significant factor - human capital."
"Innovation is not just new production methods or new uses, for example, of local products."
"In addition to this, and above all else, it is human capital."
"Finding new ways of involving society in development processes in many areas of life is an essential condition for success."
"Cooperation at a variety of social levels is slowly becoming an essential requirement, especially in the field of research and education."
"Innovation partnerships are the next step - and also a very obvious one - in a developing Europe."
"Innovation is the best way of successfully tackling the challenges with which the European Union is currently faced."
"At a time of austerity, demographic change and threats from globalisation, it is a means to the end of making Europe more competitive and creating jobs, on which all priorities are focused."
"The aim of the 'Innovation Union' flagship initiative envisioned by the EU 2020 strategy is to launch innovation partnerships to streamline research, development and the arrival of inventions on the market, starting with the area of healthy ageing as a pilot project."
"It seems relevant to me for other areas to be covered, such as young people, researchers, and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It is also desirable for work to be better carried out in partnerships, as we have unique potential in terms of values, creativity and diversity."
"I therefore call for more and better investment in education, research and development: these priorities must not only be protected from budget cuts, but must even have their budgets increased."
"I have voted in favour of this report, because the Innovation Union initiative is a concrete attempt at an integrated European innovation policy."
"The first proposed topic for the European Innovation Partnership on active and healthy ageing aims to bring about a better quality of life and improve social networks within the public sector."
"Whether other similar initiatives are started will depend on the results of this pilot project."
"The motion for a resolution that has been adopted today contains proposals that offer a great deal of potential for added value, including smart cities, which focuses on improving energy, transport and infrastructure efficiency and management, and raw materials, which aims to increase the security of supply of raw materials, together with sustainable extraction and processing, recycling and substituting."
"The European Parliament would also like to contribute to the successful implementation of this promising initiative and is therefore calling on the Commission not only to inform Parliament of the progress of this pilot project, but also to outline Parliament's involvement in determining the strategic orientation of future partnerships."
"in writing. - (LT) I supported this resolution."
"The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is an integral part of the Euro-Atlantic, Eurasian security architecture with a comprehensive concept of security, including political and military, economic and environmental, and human dimensions."
"However, in spite of its importance, the OSCE is the sole organisation among those dealing with security issues that lacks an international legal personality and consequently, there are many political and practical legal implications."
"This organisation has an essential role to play on a number of issues, including non-proliferation, disarmament, economic cooperation, and protection and promotion of human rights."
"However, the lack of a legal personality and problems with the decision-making mechanism weaken this organisation, because it is not always able to respond to crises appropriately or in a timely manner."
"I agree with the proposals expressed in the resolution on the necessity to continue the dialogue on the legal framework of the OSCE, and the call on Lithuania, which will hold the OSCE Chairmanship in 2011, to ensure continuity and progress in the process of strengthening the OSCE."
"There is no doubt that security is a stumbling block where the strengthening of the EU political integration process is concerned."
"In particular, it is worth stressing the need for appropriate implementation of a common foreign and security policy that takes account of the specific nature of individual countries and yet achieves a degree of effectiveness in proportion to the role that the European Union will come to play on the international stage."
"The principles of peace and freedom that were proclaimed in the Treaty of Rome and the others that followed it must continue to underlie any decisions that are to be made."
"So far, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has shown that the way in which it performs its duties is absolutely compatible with these principles, and therefore greater involvement by the EU's institutions in this organisation would be desirable."
"I also believe that taking greater responsibility may help the Member States reach common positions, thus consolidating relations among the 27 countries on these topics as well."
"I voted to strengthen the OSCE, which must be based on harmony between the three main pillars that the organisation is founded on: political and military, economic and environmental, and human."
"This strengthening of the OSCE must create the framework for achieving a balance where none of these aspects is supported at the expense of the others."
"The effectiveness of the actions taken against security threats and challenges depends on the proper coordination and operation of these three strands."
"The OSCE must be a key factor in the response mainly to new threats, such as organised crime, terrorism, cyber attacks, human and drug trafficking, as well in the activities aimed at warning about, preventing and resolving conflicts."
"One other reason why I voted for strengthening the OSCE is the human rights aspect, involving respect for minorities' rights and fundamental freedoms, which are key elements in the OSCE's integrated security concept."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because I advocate intensifying the efforts of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to mitigate human contributions to global warming."
"More effective cooperation between the Member States and the OSCE on combating the threats and problems caused by economic and environmental factors could make a crucial contribution to security, stability, democracy and prosperity in the region, since there are economic and environmental factors underlying the conflicts themselves."
"We live in a world in which security has become a fundamental concept, whether it is security in its traditional sense relating to defence, or economic, environmental, energy supply or transport security."
"That is why the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is taking on a crucial role at a more global scale as an integral part of the Euro-Atlantic and Euro-Asian security architecture, which stretches from Vancouver to Vladivostok."
"I agree with the final recommendation in the sense that Parliament should reflect on its participation in the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly and study the possibility of establishing a standing delegation."
"At this time, I would stress that the EU cannot fail to speak up in the OSCE on sensitive issues such as the defence of human rights and observance of international law."
"The European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) share the same principles and values in areas such as the promotion of human rights, conflict prevention, the development of democratisation, the protection of minorities, and also more recent challenges such as climate change."
"It is essential to develop synergies between the EU and the OSCE to achieve these common aims."
"The OSCE is the only organisation lacking an international legal personality that intervenes on security issues in the European region."
"In that respect, it is more important than ever to strengthen the existing OSCE structure so as to ensure fruitful collaboration with European institutions, particularly following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and in view of the forthcoming creation of the European External Action Service."
"Establishing a standing EU delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly would help to strengthen cooperation between the EU and the OSCE and would facilitate close monitoring of its activities and the implementation of shared principles and values."
"No aspect of the EU's security can be neglected."
"The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is a good reflection of this, as it is an integral part of the Euro-Atlantic and Euro-Asian security architecture, which is characterised by a global conception of security that includes political and military, economic and environmental, and human dimensions."
"The members of the OSCE are also very varied, including countries that stretch from Vancouver to Vladivostok."
"I therefore think that it is important for the EU to make an effort to strengthen its role in the OSCE, given its global nature and the diversity of its members."
"For some years, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which was founded during the cold war as an institution for monitoring and confidence building purposes, has been undergoing an identity crisis."
"According to critics, the organisation is not equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century, such as the global financial crisis and environmental issues, including climate change."
"In theory, the three main players in the OSCE are the USA, Russia and the EU."
"Even though the situation has improved slightly under the influence of the new president, American foreign policy has very little interest in multilateral organisations."
"Russia appears to have equally little interest and sees the expansion of the EU and NATO as an intrusion in its historic sphere of influence."
"As a result, it is understandable that Moscow is calling for the OSCE to take a new direction and to shift its focus from human rights and the process of democratisation to establishing a European security structure."
"Russia is essential to the EU, not only because of its supply of energy, but also as a strategic partner."
"If the EU wants to change its role in the OSCE, it must become a counterpole to the USA, rather than a powerless paymaster."
"Ultimately, a sensitive approach will be needed not only in relation to Russia, but in relation to all the Eurasian states which are represented in the OSCE but who are not members of the EU."
"As the report takes this into account, I have voted in favour of it."
"There is a need to maintain a balance between the three dimensions of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)."
"In any case, security threats must be tackled across all three dimensions."
"This also applies to current threats such as organised crime, terrorism, cyber threats, human and drug trafficking, energy security, as well as activities relating to early warning mechanisms and conflict prevention and resolution."
"It is both sensible and beneficial to reinforce the interaction and promote the synergy between the EU and the OSCE."
"For this reason, I have voted in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"The European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) need to be strengthened."
"The role of the latter is important and essential in a whole series of sectors, particularly for the part it plays in security and the defence of democracy."
"Even if these two organisations have different needs, objectives and structures, it is important that there are no contrasting positions or overlaps liable to cause conflicts of competence."
"Their roles are defined and different, but in any case, there is a risk of duplication in some areas."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, since I support both its content and its spirit."
"Indeed, I believe that OSCE is an essential organisation that positions itself as a forum and takes account of both EU-Asia and EU-United States relations."
"Clearly, given its Member States, the European Union is both the fulcrum and the base of the OSCE, so I hope that it has a leading role within it."
"I voted for this resolution because I understand that the OSCE should be used to its full potential."
"Profound reflection is therefore needed on how the European Union can take on more responsibility and participate more actively in achieving common goals."
"in writing. - By adopting this resolution, Parliament emphasises the need to maintain a balance between the three dimensions of the OSCE, developing them coherently and comprehensively and building on what has already been achieved."
"It points out that none of the dimensions may be strengthened to the detriment of another."
"It stresses that security threats and challenges should be tackled through all three dimensions if action is to be truly effective, including contemporary ones such as organised crime, terrorism, cyber threats, human and drug trafficking, energy security, as well as activities relating to early warning mechanisms, and conflict prevention and resolution."
"It emphasises that the strengthening of the OSCE should not come at the price of weakening the existing institutions and mechanisms or affecting their independence, when they have not yet been reformed or alternatives have not yet been agreed, particularly as regards the work of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR)."
"Finally, it calls on the OSCE to further strengthen its capacity to ensure respect for and the implementation of principles and commitments undertaken by its participating states in all three dimensions, inter alia, by enhancing follow-up mechanisms."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as many of you know already, Lithuania will take over the Chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in January 2011."
"This chairmanship could be a unique opportunity for my country to take initiatives to strengthen regional cooperation, increase energy security and combat corruption."
"It is also important not to underestimate the human dimension of OSCE cooperation."
"As well as its political and military dimension, the OSCE also plays a crucial role in promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"The EU must also play an important role in this field."
"The coordination of EU and OSCE activities in the field of human rights is a common interest we all share."
"Let us not forget the circumstances in which the OSCE was established."
"This year marks the 35th anniversary of the inaugural conference of the OSCE and the Helsinki Final Act, when the foundations of this organisation were laid."
"This event symbolised a moral and political commitment to the principles of democracy and human rights."
"It is regrettable that this spirit of Helsinki has dimmed in recent years."
"This must change."
"I therefore await the results of the OSCE summit this December in Astana with much impatience."
"I have voted in favour of this report because the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has lost a great deal of its influence over the last ten years."
"In the motion for a resolution, the European Parliament praises the activities of the OSCE in the past and calls on the Member States, the Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to come up with proposals as to how the Union can effectively become involved in the OSCE and can contribute constructively to achieving the shared objectives."
"Anyone who wants to avoid military intervention in crises must take preventative political measures in good time."
"History teaches us that armed conflicts are an outcome of the inability of the combatants to talk about contentious issues and find compromise solutions."
"The OSCE represents a forum for seeking such solutions."
"At the same time, the OSCE is today respected as an independent arbiter in assessing the democratic running of elections, and democratic standards."
"I am therefore in favour of strengthening the OSCE, particularly in relation to the spreading of democracy and compliance with human rights."
"The OSCE monitoring and field missions are an important part of the expansion of the free world."
"However, from an EU perspective, some activities are being duplicated here."
"If we are talking about strengthening the OSCE, we should, at the same time, think about the extent to which the OSCE can replace the activities of EU representatives in various conflict regions."
"Also, as we are praising the work of the OSCE in the area of human rights, this opens up the possibility of discussing the extent to which the roles of the OSCE and the Council of Europe overlap."
"The aim of this discussion should be to achieve higher efficiency in the spending of public funds, which, in a time of cost cutting, is undoubtedly a priority for our voters."
"I voted for the report on the demographic challenge and solidarity between generations because, under the current circumstances of the unprecedented demographic problems posed by increased life expectancy and falling birth rates, they constitute one of the most urgent social policy challenges of coming years."
"Decisions need to be taken urgently, especially at a time when the availability of jobs for young people and the sustainability of pension systems for older people are at risk."
"Solidarity between generations is needed to enable the contributions of both generations to be optimised."
"The only way that this will be possible is by guaranteeing free and equal access to jobs, lifelong training and career progression for all ages."
"That will be possible, firstly, through ensuring that young people are guaranteed jobs and, secondly, through making good use of the contribution that older people can still make to society, notably in terms of voluntary work and of their continuing to work beyond the established retirement age."
"While emphasising that a society which respects human dignity is based on the principle of justice between the generations, I believe that this report is important in terms of combating prejudices and discrimination in every form and against every group in society as well."
"I maintain that the migration of citizens, their successful integration, including into economic life, and their social inclusion, can provide a means of tackling demographic change."
"For these reasons, I agree that an open debate is required to discuss various immigration policies."
"Eradicating prejudice about different cultural models is a prerequisite for the successful integration of immigrants, which also complements solidarity between the generations and cultures."
"The report also proposes adopting new provisions against age discrimination with regard to accessing goods and services."
"This is why I voted for Thomas Mann's report."
"According to the Commission's estimates, demographic changes are in danger of profoundly altering population structure and age groups."
"Thus, the number of young people aged 0 to 14 would drop from 100 million to 66 million in 2050."
"As for the population of working age, it would peak at 331 million around 2010 and would then decrease regularly to around 268 million in 2050."
"Faced with this situation, the EU must provide a suitable solution in order to protect employment among older people, but also among young people."
"I voted for this initiative report by the European Parliament which calls on Member States to think about the possibility of scrapping legal retirement ages but which also provides the broad outlines of a policy enabling us to fight against discrimination, to set lifelong learning as a goal, to promote a reflection on new ways of organising work within businesses - particularly with a view to reducing stress."
"Furthermore, this resolution contains many initiatives highlighting, for instance, the fight against youth unemployment or in favour of a decent pension and proposing a European Pact for the over-50s."
"I support strongly what this report says on raising skill levels so that quality education and better opportunities for lifelong learning would await every group and generation in society."
"I welcome the recognition given in the report to the good and the benefit to EU society achieved by all those engaged in voluntary work, working to develop the local community and to provide a care service in the community or the family."
"Moreover, I support the initiative of the European Parliament with regard to seeking a review of healthy ageing in the EU and to presenting an Action Plan for the Year 2011, which would aim to help increase the dignity, health and quality of life of older people."
"The Commission must be commended for its call to action as regards tackling infringements of the rights of older persons and as regards protecting the elderly in the community and in nursing homes."
"in writing. - (LT) I support this report."
"We are now facing a twofold crisis - a high unemployment rate among young people coupled with a question mark over retirement pension funding."
"These two phenomena are related and therefore, they should be dealt with together."
"Demographic change is manageable and sustainable if it is properly anticipated and taken seriously by everyone."
"The Member States possess the main instruments for ensuring balance between the generations and ending unfair discrimination."
"Where there is insufficient monitoring of pension systems, national budgets, healthcare, education and employment policy, structural reforms should be carried out and new sustainable solutions found."
"At the same time, the EU should be responsible for exchanges of best practice between the Member States, for monitoring the implementation of EU legislation in the Member States, and for taking the initiative in adopting new legislation in these fields."
"There were some very good points in Mr Mann's own-initiative report on the demographic challenge and solidarity between generations, in particular, concerning the importance of the intergenerational contract in our modern-day societies, youth unemployment and the need to address the challenges faced by the elderly in parallel with those faced by young people."
"Nevertheless, I voted against the resolution because certain paragraphs were unacceptable, in particular, those regarding pensions."
"Fortunately, the paragraph explicitly mentioning the need to replace the pay-as-you-go system with capital-funded systems was rejected by a large majority in this House."
"However, another paragraph, which calls on 'Member States to look again at the feasibility of scrapping compulsory retirement ages', was adopted."
"That is truly unthinkable!"
"Yes, there must be more flexibility in the pensions system, but the retirement age must remain a fundamental pillar of it!"
"At a time when the Commission is concluding its consultation on the future of pensions in Europe, Parliament's message is particularly important."
"That is why I decided to vote against the resolution."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted for this report, because we must strive not for conflict and competition between generations, but equal opportunities and solidarity."
"However, I did not support the European Parliament rapporteur's opinion that early retirement should be eliminated."
"Actually, very often, elderly people are forced to take early retirement because of certain circumstances, not as a matter of choice."
"Given the consequences of the economic crisis, the opportunity to take early retirement is often the only chance of survival for elderly people who have been made redundant."
"Therefore, given the fact that national pension systems differ between the Member States, we must take into account the practice in all Member States, and not follow the example of one or just a few countries."
"The Member States themselves must reach a decision on the implementation of early retirement provisions, taking into account their country's situation and practice."
"Once again, I would like to draw attention to the fact that both demographic changes and age discrimination are undermining intergenerational solidarity and economic growth."
"Such discrimination severely constrains access to the labour market for both older and younger workers."
"In recent years, EU Member States, faced with a dramatic decline in the birth rate, have had to cope with an increasingly ageing population."
"The rise in life expectancy is a positive development, keeping people physically and mentally active for longer."
"In these circumstances, it is becoming clear that we need to face the prospect of the situation becoming even more serious, resulting in a demographic imbalance which will have its impact on Member States' economies and budget resources, a development which has repercussions as well for the EU as a whole."
"Therefore, we are facing the possibility of future generations bearing the financial burden for these demographic changes."
"This situation makes the Lisbon objective of having half the population aged between 55 and 64 in employment absolutely essential, even if it has been missed this year."
"To counter this phenomenon, swift and decisive measures must be taken, in a lifecycle-orientated approach, to bring young and older people into the labour market."
"The proportion of people out of work in the 15-24 age group is considerably higher than that for any other age group in the EU."
"Therefore, the proposal for the European Youth Guarantee initiative should be recommended."
"First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Mann on the drafting of this report, which has the merit of proposing specific measures for establishing a worthwhile dialogue between generations."
"I voted in favour because I believe that establishing a fair balance between generations is the only way for the younger generation to be given real assurances and to increase their participation in the labour market."
"I also believe the time has come for the European Union and the Member States to examine the new questions posed by the generational challenge."
"Europe will soon, in fact, be facing real problems due to its low demographic growth, and suitable policies need to be adopted straight away so as not to jeopardise the entire European social security system."
"In this respect, I think it is essential to re-evaluate social policy in favour of the over-sixties."
"People in this age group bring added value to the world of work, and therefore preparatory measures should be taken to involve them more."
"I therefore agree with the proposal to review the social security system so as to allow the over-sixties to keep their jobs after they have reached retirement age."
"In my opinion, the rapporteur quite correctly proposes two measures relating to the effects of the unevenness of demographic development on the financing of social expenditure and the financial situation of pension systems in all Member States."
"The first measure aims to increase employment among young people, and the second to put back the retirement age."
"I agree with the rapporteur's view that older people are not a burden for the economy and society but, on the contrary, a great benefit because of their experience of life and their knowledge."
"I have decided to vote in favour of the report, because the controversial section which supported the idea of replacing the current continuous system with a system based on capital funds has been taken out of the report."
"I voted against the report."
"It addresses the demographic problem and solidarity between the generations in a very conservative manner."
"In numerous instances, such as the almost unlimited extension of working life, it blows the workers' labour and insurance rights sky high and will exhaust them completely."
"The problem of youth unemployment is growing."
"Improvements to life expectancy and living standards are becoming a problem, rather than a pan-human - and, hence, pan-European - objective."
"We are today faced with a high rate of youth unemployment and underfinanced pension schemes."
"We must find a joint solution, since youth must be considered a precious and essential resource that must be mobilised in the pursuit of social and economic objectives, particularly in an ageing society."
"If we do not manage to reverse the current trend, it is estimated that by 2030, demographic change will result in a two-to-one ratio between the active and inactive populations."
"Although the main instruments for promoting justice between generations fall under the jurisdiction of the Member States, the EU plays a crucial role in terms of surveillance, monitoring the correct and effective implementation of Union anti-discrimination legislation, and in terms of promoting the exchange of best practices and action plans."
"It is essential for the EU and the Member States to promote new initiatives for active, healthy and dignified ageing."
"It is also necessary to establish long-term prospects for young people, and to take measures to encourage mobility during their studies, ensure high quality vocational training and create new jobs, thus securing their full participation in society."
"The report brings together many topics that are all of huge importance, especially for the needier sections of the population."
"I must emphasise a cross-cutting aspect to the proposals and initiatives: we have to come to terms with a world that is changing ever more rapidly, with marked repercussions on social and welfare systems."
"We are well aware that the assurances we enjoyed in the past cannot be guaranteed for the future, and we have to be ready to form a society that is still able to prosper in circumstances that are no longer the same as in the present or past."
"I wholeheartedly welcome the appeal for solidarity, as well as the definition of 'justice between the generations'."
"I also intend to do everything possible to find a solution to the uncertainties surrounding the size of the old-age pension that my generation will encounter in my country."
"Member States have available the main instruments for promoting justice between the generations and eliminating discrimination."
"The number of people in the European Union over the age of 60 is set to grow at an unprecedented rate, estimated to achieve its peak between 2015 and 2035, when two million people will be added to this section of the population every year."
"Given these factors, I believe that the EU must devise an effective policy so that workers can remain in the labour market and not be subjected to age discrimination."
"Indeed, there needs to be as much participation as possible by women from every age group in lifelong learning programmes."
"Equality and solidarity between generations within the European Union are becoming one of the most important challenges for European social policy in the coming decades."
"Overall, therefore, I am voting in favour of the measures proposed in this report."
"There must be a shift in paradigm with regard to how societies and economies view the ageing of the population."
"Instead of seeing them as a burden and synonymous with increased costs, their experience and knowledge mean that older people should be seen as a valuable asset in business culture."
"To this end, businesses should be encouraged to develop age-management strategies, which would increase their competitiveness by making use of the experience and specific qualities of their older workers."
"I also believe that the ageing of the population provides an important opportunity to improve competitiveness and encourage potential innovation, thereby promoting growth and creating jobs."
"Finally, I should like to express my concern about the high rate of youth unemployment in the EU, and the need to create more jobs and establish long-term prospects that enable them to ensure their full participation in society."
"Justice in relations between generations represents the new global challenge that needs to be adequately tackled."
"Modern societies have found themselves presiding over a period of constant growth in which, above all in the last few decades, new generations have had better conditions and prospects ahead of them than previous generations."
"Now, the situation has surpassed the limits of seemingly endless growth and we find ourselves faced with a debate between rights and limited resources."
"All countries, beginning with the developed and democratic ones and their related organisations (like the EU), must therefore work determinedly, conclusively and cogently to work out policies, make choices and implement them coherently for a greater equilibrium between current and future generations, so that the division and distance between those with rights and those without, and those with resources and those without, may be reduced."
"It seems to me that the report on the demographic challenge and solidarity between generations that we have voted on works along these lines."
"in writing. - I support this report, which makes a number of important proposals to tackle the demographic challenges we face in a spirit of solidarity between generations."
"Insufficient welfare provisions, inadequate social services and high levels of youth unemployment contribute to late marriage and childbirth, thus accelerating the ageing of our populations."
"Both the young and the elderly experience different forms of age discrimination, particularly as regards access to the labour market and certain social services."
"While Member States control key instruments such as national budgets, pension and healthcare services, the EU can further the reach of anti-discrimination legislation, particularly to protect older women in the labour market."
"Moreover, women of all ages often care for young and elderly dependents."
"Their work is, in itself, an example of intergenerational support and needs socio-economic recognition, although not as a substitute to the development of quality care services."
"As atypical and precarious forms of work become increasingly common, the right to a decent pension at the age of retirement is threatened."
"This trend can only be countered by economic policies focused on growth, respect for workers' rights and the provision of quality public services."
"With regard to paragraph 24, giving older employees the option of continuing to work after the compulsory retirement age if they wish to must not lead to pressure being exerted on these employees which will result in the practice of employing people after retirement age becoming widespread."
"Older employees must still be able to retire at the age specified by law without the risk of being subjected to discrimination."
"As I have said previously, European society is ageing, which is often seen as a negative in economic analysis."
"Naturally, the inversion of the demographic pyramid in countries where the welfare state is still strong means that there are ever fewer people contributing to the social assistance system and ever more people dependent on it."
"In very blunt terms, more older people means increased spending on pensions and health."
"However, a society of solidarity cannot look at ageing in this way."
"It is essential to create active ageing solutions and ways to make use of the immense human potential of older people, who, even in a competitive market like Europe's, still represent an added value because of their greater experience and knowledge."
"At the other end of the scale, we cannot talk about an ageing population without talking about birth policies that encourage the birth of children in the European Union."
"The average birth rate in the EU is 1.5 children, one of the lowest in the world; this can only be reversed with robust policies in support of families, which do not penalise men and women who decide to have children, in economic, tax and professional terms."
"This is a report full of contradictions."
"On the one hand, it uses very complimentary language about older people."
"On the other hand, however, it puts forward basic measures that, in practice, put the rights of older people and of workers in general at risk."
"Some examples of this are:"
"encouraging private pension systems, thus prioritising the financial sector and forgetting the serious consequences that these practices have already had, notably in the United States, where they left millions of pensioners destitute, forcing the state to intervene;"
"encouraging state intervention to increase part-time work and flexible work, brushing aside the consequences of these practices, such as the devaluing of labour, low wages, precarious work, and increased numbers of workers with incomes below the poverty line;"
"encouraging an increase in the age at which the pension can be claimed."
"We voted against the report for all these reasons, although we acknowledge that it has certain positive aspects, which are, however, threatened by the neoliberal policies that the report advocates."
"As Europe goes through this period of financial, economic and social crisis, it is faced with a serious problem: unemployment."
"This predicament affects young people particularly badly and is creating a worrying situation that will have dire consequences for Europe's future competitiveness."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because, while recognising the principle of subsidiarity and the competence of the Member States in this area, I think the European Union should make its own contribution by encouraging dialogue among the various actors on solidarity between generations."
"Tomorrow's workforce will be made up of today's young people."
"If they put off entering the labour market, it will mean delayed careers, lower wages and a pay gap compared with the other generations."
"We need to help young people more and support entrepreneurship and youth employment."
"Only by doing so can we ensure a less uncertain future for the younger generations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a shame that Mr Mann's report, which, despite containing some good points promoting family-friendly policies, reconciling work and family life, older and younger workers' access to the labour market, etc., advocates immigration as a solution, albeit partial, to the ageing population of our countries, and even to the financing of pensions."
"In every country, including France, studies show that this is not the case, not only when it comes to demographics, but also in terms of finance."
"Even Mrs Tribalat, a French demographer that could hardly be accused of being sympathetic to the National Front, has come to the same conclusion."
"I am well aware that in this House, we like to believe that, according to the SOS Racisme slogan, 'Mohamed will pay for Maurice's pension' .... as well as that of Karl, Matthew and Juan."
"Yet that is not true, anywhere."
"Mr Mann should also be careful when he recommends replacing our pay-as-you-go systems with capital-funded systems."
"Given the current backdrop of the world financial crisis, this is the type of proposal that could bring ruin to our elderly people, with the likes of Madoff being the only ones to benefit."
"Solidarity between generations is one of the main social challenges of European policy and of national policies for the years to come, as we face an ageing European population."
"This report quite rightly puts great emphasis on this value of solidarity, on the need for intergenerational solidarity, on the importance of the contract between generations; it contains very positive passages, for instance on balancing work and family life, flexible working time, especially for women, access to employment by young and older people, fighting against discrimination, etc. However, this report contains many things with which I do not agree; i.e. paragraph 24, which calls for scrapping compulsory retirement ages, several passages on flexible work organisation and simpler social legislation, and a passage on scrapping early retirement schemes."
"Moreover, I preferred to abstain during the vote on this report."
"Apart from that, I am pleased that the passage calling for the pay-as-you-go pension system to be replaced with a capital-funded system was nevertheless rejected by the European Parliament."
"I voted against the report on the demographic challenge and intergenerational solidarity for it contained unacceptable stances."
"There are particularly interesting things in this text, like the fact that youth employment should not be set against retaining over-50s in the labour market, as well as the emphasis placed on lifelong learning and the fight against age and gender discrimination in the labour market."
"However, the text also contains many recommendations concerning pension systems that I cannot endorse."
"Among other things, the text invites states to scrap the legal retirement age, and lays great stress upon the need to reduce the burden of the public debt, which is tantamount to encouraging privately funded pension systems that are particularly unfair."
"The report also invites states to increase employment rates by expanding part-time work, which only serves to make job insecurity worse."
"These are some of the reasons why I voted against this text."
"The current unevenness of demographic development has significant effects on the financing of social expenditure and the financial situation of pension systems in all Member States."
"In his non-legislative report, Thomas Mann proposes two measures; on the one hand, to increase employment among young people and, on the other, to put back the retirement age."
"I agree with the rapporteur's view that older people are not a burden for the economy and society but, on the contrary, a great benefit because of their experience, their life's work and their knowledge."
"In this regard, I agree with the rapporteur, who is proposing concrete measures for establishing a basis for open dialogue, and calling on the Commission and the Council to introduce an intergenerational balance in all Member States and at EU level."
"The principle of justice between the generations will be one of the main political challenges of the next few years."
"As demographic change is influencing relationships in our society, it is particularly important that one generation is not living at the expense of another."
"This not only applies to financial and budgetary policy, but also includes protecting the environment, the available resources and the climate."
"In order to ensure that our society remains cohesive, we must see justice between the generations as a mainstream task."
"As a result, we must examine all our political decisions in this light."
"It is important that we devote our attention to this subject in order to maintain the sense of solidarity within our society in future."
"I have voted in favour of the report on the demographic challenge, but against the paragraph which calls on the Member States 'to give consideration to regulated labour migration (immigration from third countries into the EU)'."
"In my opinion, this wording implies a positive assessment of labour migration from third countries."
"I have voted in favour of the Mann report because the recommendation to change the way in which pensions are financed in the original report was not adopted by the European Parliament."
"However, I very much oppose the requirement to encourage private pension provision and to ensure that, on average, public sector pensions are no more generous than comparable private sector pensions."
"In addition, I am opposed to private sector pension funds playing a more important role in diminishing the future burden of providing state pensions."
"In my opinion, the pay-as-you-go system is the most economically sensible and sustainable system."
"in writing. - Ireland's society is ageing at an unprecedented rate."
"This initiative contains several suggestions to the Commission that would help deal with the problems that countries throughout Europe will face in the coming decades."
"This report was careful to emphasise the solidarity between the generations and is clever to ensure that nobody thinks that there is one single solution to the ageing society and the problems that are entailed with it."
"I supported Mr Mann's report because I believe the generational challenge should be a priority policy for future European action."
"Young people are unquestionably a key resource in whom we must invest in order to revitalise the European Union economy as a whole."
"In my view, they deserve special attention."
"I also think it is worth stressing the importance of education and employment policy."
"In fact, the strengthening of growth and employment, to be achieved through equal access to education opportunities and the labour market, is, in my view, a step that needs to be taken in order to attain certain important growth targets, such as improving competitiveness and innovation potential."
"I voted against the Mann report because it is imbued with liberal thinking which uses an ageing European population as an excuse to advocate reforms to the public systems of social protection in Europe, particularly by undermining the healthcare and pay-as-you-go pension systems, by encouraging their privatisation and a later retirement age, which I reject."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that I endorsed the Mann report on the demographic challenge and solidarity between generations, because I think one of the most serious problems facing the European Union today is the question of the ageing of society in the Member States."
"It is a challenge which the European Union must overcome, if conditions are to be created which promote maternity, if ever better methods of reconciling a working life with family life are to be devised and if good use is to be made of the opportunities presented by a more productive life."
"The year 2012 is to be declared European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations, and so I think that we MEPs must promote a policy of active ageing and draw attention to the new demographic challenges."
"Mr Mann's report is detailed and well structured and has fully incorporated the suggestions made by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, granting gender its just and necessary importance in this subject area."
"This House is becoming known for implementing specific policies designed to improve equal dignity and quality of life for everyone, in all of our countries, while also recognising the known differences between regions."
"I therefore appreciate and draw attention to the space devoted to balancing family life with work and private life, in particular, the space and the role attributed to women, including older women, in applying the principle of justice between generations."
"We are called upon at all levels - it is important that civil society as well as secular and religious associations are involved - to respond with suitable policies to create a solid Europe without discrimination on account of age or gender, a Europe that will not grow old without seeing strong, new generations emerge."
"This report argues that rising life expectancy must not have the effect of reducing employees' rights."
"That is what it advocates, though, from start to finish."
"Raising the retirement age as far as possible beyond 64 years old, as promised in the EU 2020 strategy, promoting casual work, replacing pay-as-you-go pension schemes with capital-funded pension schemes are some of the measures to which the European Parliament will be committed if it votes for this report."
"I am voting against this unspeakable social regression."
"The demographic challenge and solidarity between generations are the key points for a better future."
"We must, therefore, staunchly resist all factors reducing demographic growth, particularly: inadequate welfare payments, the slow and difficult nature of integration into the labour market proper, long periods spent in insecure or temporary employment, and a lack of support for young couples are among the reasons for young people postponing forming a family and having children."
"Moreover, ever higher life expectancies mean the number of older people is increasing, along with the resulting consequences."
"Solidarity between generations must therefore be reinforced, so that we can have a fairer and more balanced society."
"The steadily increasing life expectancy of European citizens is excellent news which favours intergenerational dynamics and exchange."
"On the other hand, if we look at it in terms of the future of our pension schemes, an ageing population causes a real headache to political decision makers and to advocates of balanced budgets."
"If we add to this the low birth rate in many of the 27 Member States, intergenerational solidarity is akin to Proust's Madeleine with European societies remembering things past."
"To paraphrase Mr Mann's excellent report: Europe must rise to the demographic challenge, and Jean Bodin's famous formula: 'the only wealth is man' now makes perfect sense."
"To maintain a fair society, one that works in solidarity, in other words, one in which we refuse to burden future generations with our public debts and in which balance between the number of pensioners and the active population is favoured, there is only one solution."
"It will inevitably require action using a number of approaches: job and retirement flexibility, a humanist and realistic immigration policy, and clear complementarities between the pay-as-you-go and capital-funded financing systems, the reason why the MR delegation voted against paragraph 99 on this last matter."
"I was supportive of Mr Mann's report on the whole, but I should like to emphasise that the report covers rather too many topics and does not offer solutions to problems."
"The question of discrimination against vulnerable ethnic groups is very important and requires a separate assessment."
"For example, in Latvia, there are over 200 000 Latgallians, who cannot even receive primary education in the Latgallian language."
"We have drawn attention to this issue many times in the national parliament of the Republic of Latvia, but still no one from the ruling Latvian elite is even prepared to discuss the question."
"The European Union is faced with an increasingly ageing population."
"By 2060, there will be only two adults of working age for every one person over the age of 65."
"Currently, the ratio is 4:1."
"As a result, the older generation could become a major burden on the working population which is responsible for supporting the economy."
"As it is to be expected that the retirement age will be increased, working conditions for older people should be adapted and made more attractive."
"Older employees should be given better opportunities for participating in the labour market."
"A new approach is also needed in society to ensure that older people are no longer discriminated against because of their reduced capabilities, for example."
"I am abstaining, because although the proposals concerning healthy ageing are very much to be welcomed, there are still some unclear areas relating to the issue of a longer working life."
"Our population is shrinking and the result is that it is also ageing and therefore creating an increasing burden on pension systems."
"In order to overcome the demographic challenges of the future, a consistent family friendly policy is needed."
"However, uncontrolled mass immigration into the EU is the wrong approach."
"Therefore, I have abstained from voting."
"I voted in favour of Mr Mann's report."
"The development that has taken place in the European Union and its various Member States over recent decades has brought changes and consequences which are socially evident and which require support from the European institutions."
"The concept of development is inevitably associated with economic, social and cultural matters, to the extent that these sectors cannot be separated when one refers to the process of globalisation and development."
"In this context, the work of the European institutions should contain and provide support for this inequality, which causes a lack of social cohesion."
"This common ideal would result in greater social cohesion, less economic inequality and a balanced individual and collective development of society."
"Development and social cohesion must not be enemies of progress but an integral part of it for more robust integration and coexistence in society."
"In this context, the demographic challenge due to the ageing of the population means that we must accelerate the process and reconsider some social structures and programmes in order to adapt them to this new landscape."
"The demographic problem is making the importance of lifelong learning as a product of solidarity between the generations even more topical than ever."
"Knowledge, education, training and information have no age limits."
"Nonetheless, in the 2011 budget, the increase in funds for lifelong learning programmes was pitiful, despite the claims in the EU 2020 strategy and despite the Member States' promise to invest in education for all citizens, regardless of age."
"The report acknowledges that we need to create instruments to support the ongoing education of citizens and strengthen those which already exist, such as the Grundtvig programme and the Leonardo da Vinci programme."
"The motion is a move in that direction, which is why I voted for it."
"In a European Union in which ever more people are living ever longer, in which the birth rate is generally low, and in which the demographic pyramid is already inverted, it is important that we reflect on the 'demographic challenge and solidarity between generations'."
"I therefore welcome this timely report."
"Furthermore, its content is generally worthy of my approval, especially as regards the future prerogative of senior citizens to continue working if they so wish, which, in fact, fits with the 'active ageing' being promoted, and also as regards promoting the employability of young people who go more than four months without finding work."
"On the one hand, demographic change means that people fortunately have longer life expectancies and remain physically and mentally active for longer."
"On the other, birth rates in the Member States have remained at low levels for decades, and the older generations account for an ever increasing proportion of the population."
"The limits of the intergenerational contract have been reached."
"Active ageing means a process of maximising the potential for people to stay healthy, participate in the life of their communities and improve their quality of life as they grow older."
"I am firmly convinced that 2012 should be declared the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations, with a view to highlighting the contribution that young and older people make to society."
"That is why I have done my best here to give all the support needed for Europe to overcome this challenge."
"Age discrimination is undermining intergenerational solidarity, which is forbidden under the treaty but which remains widespread and severely constrains older and younger workers' access to the labour market, social security and certain services. I voted in favour of adopting strong measures from Member States to counter the grey or black economy maintained by an 'undeclared' workforce, the victims of which are women in most cases, which is more than adversely affecting the EU labour market, rather than just promoting measures aiming to protect their own workers."
"At the same time, undeclared work must be combated using concrete measures and sanctions against employers and/or intermediaries."
"I also voted for Member States and the Commission to cooperate as well on the supervision of care services, as part of which Member States could consider setting up a network of national care contact points which could be used both at national and European level to obtain information about the care services provided and their quality, as well as to lodge complaints about the quality of these services."
"Equality between generations will be one of the main challenges for European social policy in coming years."
"This timely report should, therefore, definitely be welcomed, as it stresses the need to safeguard solidarity between generations and points out ways that this can be achieved, specifically as regards promoting active ageing policies."
"I have voted in favour of the report on the demographic challenge and solidarity between the generations, because the recommendation to change the way in which pensions are financed in the original report was not adopted by the European Parliament."
"I am very much opposed to the requirement to encourage private pension provision and to ensure that, on average, public sector pensions are no more generous, both in terms of contributions and benefits, than comparable private sector pensions."
"In addition, private sector pension funds should not play a more important role in diminishing the future burden of providing state pensions."
"The pay-as-you-go system must not, under any circumstances, be replaced by capital-funded systems."
"In my opinion, the pay-as-you-go system is the most economically sensible and sustainable system."
"However, I have voted against the passage in the resolution which calls on the Member States 'to give consideration to regulated labour migration (immigration from third countries into the EU)'."
"In my opinion, this wording implies a positive assessment of labour migration from third countries."
"in writing. - We Greens have supported the text because paragraph 99 (on private/capital-funded systems) was deleted, and because the rest of the text has taken some positive Green points on board."
"For instance, measures concerning the retirement age should be based on the needs of the persons concerned; periods spent working, learning, caring or volunteering are complementary and provide valuable experience at all ages; there is a need to combat age discrimination and to set country specific targets for access to training and lifelong learning for older workers, broken down by age group and gender."
"Older people's employability also depends on autonomy and individual choice for workers and a better work-life balance."
"In order to avoid a disproportionate burden on women because of an increased demand for care in an ageing society, labour and care should be rendered compatible in all Member States and equally distributed between women and men."
"The part of this report that proposes a reduction in the tax and administrative burden for companies is positive: this is an important goal for reducing competition from third countries where tax, production and labour costs are appreciably lower than in Europe."
"It is also positive in proposing to limit old-age pension obligations, both because of the rise in average age and because of improved health, allowing those who wish to do so to continue working."
"It is a pity that amendments that we find unacceptable have been used to insert parts that are not at all pertinent to the report and whose aim is to encourage the integration of people from outside the European Union."
"That decision, which was supported by a majority in this Chamber, forces us, regretfully, to vote against the report."
"I take this opportunity to emphasise that a humane society is necessarily based on the principle of justice between the generations, and that age discrimination jeopardises solidarity between the generations, leads to poverty and is forbidden by the founding treaties."
"Work is more than just paid employment and both young and older people contribute substantially, including through their work in the family, to making our society more humane and improving the stability of services and workplaces."
"In this report, we call on governments to facilitate and recognise voluntary work that provides care in the community and family care, and to resolve issues of legal responsibility in that regard without delay."
"I also applaud this report for calling on the Member States to adopt measures to recognise invisible and informal work carried out by family members, predominantly women, of all ages in caring for older and younger members, in the context of solidarity between generations."
"It is a fact that the whole of Europe is facing demographic changes, which include the ageing of society, low birth rates, population migrations from poorer countries to wealthier ones, longer life expectancies, delays in entering the labour market, the growing number of one-person households and households without children, etc. This all combines to create the enormous need for change which the new demographic challenges and the growing role of bringing generations together impose on us."
"It has become essential to introduce a well thought out system of intergenerational accounting, along with reform of the system of social care and the taxation system in Europe, including pension systems, guarantees of appropriate care for the older generation and avoidance of the process which is creating the growing debt of the younger generations."
"Therefore, it is essential to reform the Stability and Growth Pact, so that Member States can meet their obligations to make their pension systems more stable."
"Mr Mann's report on the demographic challenge and solidarity between generations sheds light on the challenges raised by demographic change, in particular, unemployment and job insecurity, education and discrimination affecting vulnerable groups."
"It highlights the need for intergenerational solidarity and puts forward some pertinent suggestions, namely, an initiative regarding a European 50-plus pact which includes combating age discrimination, the objective of full employment up to the legal retirement age and helping to reintegrate older disabled people."
"The reason why I abstained from the final vote when this report was more than satisfactory is because paragraph 24, which wants to scrap compulsory retirement ages, has been maintained."
"The fact is, if we have no safeguards enabling our senior citizens to take their retirement, we can no longer guarantee them a good end to their life."
"I refuse to see our older people working up to their death as we saw in the 19th century."
"Solidarity is one of the values governing the European Union, so realising it in terms of equality between generations is essential."
"The Member States are facing a series of demographic and social challenges that make it necessary to establish solidarity between generations."
"Increased life expectancy and the decreased birth rate will have terrible consequences for European social systems if specific measures cannot be taken."
"Given the current situation, the European Parliament believes in the need to initiate a dialogue aimed at intergenerational relationships."
"The report cuts across many sectors, going from education to employment with regard to both old and young people, to health policy and welfare payments, to family and birth rate policy, and even to the development of welfare systems, culminating in migration policies to solve the problems of an ageing society."
"I hope that the initiatives included in this report can be implemented and that justice and dialogue between generations can be the reality in the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the report duly notes that steadily decreasing populations in the European Union and the continuing tendency of low birth rates are creating numerous challenges for Europe's economy and society."
"For these reasons, the EU labour market will experience mostly negative structural changes."
"In Lithuania, these demographic problems are further compounded by the mass exodus of Lithuania's young people to work abroad."
"We are a small nation and we are rapidly losing our most active 25-40 year olds, in whose upbringing and education much was invested."
"Lithuania needs these young people's talents, experience and diligence to overcome the demographic challenges mentioned."
"I therefore support the European Youth Guarantee initiative proposed by the rapporteur, according to which all young people in the EU would be offered a job, an apprenticeship or additional training following a period of six months' unemployment."
"More should also be done to increase birth rates: accessible high quality childcare, education and mentoring for young children is the first step in the right direction."
"We must also stop the social exclusion of elderly people."
"We must persuade our economy and society that the elderly are not a burden."
"Their experience, achievements and wealth of knowledge can be useful for all generations."
"I voted against this report which, once again, shows how the majorities that govern Europe are incapable of listening to the demands of European citizens."
"Although, on these matters, the European Union has no competence over the exclusive competencies of Member States, Mr Mann shatters both the social achievements gained and the principle of subsidiarity."
"Among other things, the report encourages Member States to promote working beyond the legal retirement age and wants Member States to provide incentives to the over-60s to remain in work longer through the adaptation of work places to their health status."
"Above all, elderly people must be entitled to a decent pension, enabling them to live life with dignity."
"Furthermore, it is mainly early retirement schemes that are used to make arrangements to meet the needs of workers nearing the end of their career and yet, quite simply, Mr Mann wants to dismantle them."
"Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that the European Parliament has rejected one passage explicitly calling for the replacement of the pay-as-you-go system with capital-funded systems."
"Under the guise of intergenerational solidarity, Mr Mann even feels the need to remind us that older people must be treated equally as human beings with fundamental rights."
"Point duly made."
"(The explanation of vote was cut short pursuant to Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"As always, Mr Mann has done a very good job on a sensitive subject."
"As a result, I was able to vote in favour of the report."
"I would like briefly to add another aspect to the discussion."
"As a Member of the European Parliament from Saxony, a region which is hard hit by demographic change, and as a Member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and rapporteur of the own-initiative report on future innovation policy in the EU, I would like to say that at EU level and, above all, in the Member States, we must, of course, continue to combat demographic change and make the regions more attractive for young people, in particular, by increasing economic growth, creating jobs and developing a tailor-made education policy."
"However, I would also like to emphasise the special importance of older workers in SMEs with regard to innovation."
"The EU has finally recognised that, in particular in SMEs, it is not only new technological inventions which are innovative, but also, for example, the ability to adapt a product to meet a customer's specific circumstances or improve service processes."
"Particularly in this area, it is older employees who have a wealth of experience and can make a company innovative."
"For this reason, we must combat age discrimination in the workplace."
"The EU and the Member States must take this into consideration in all their social and labour legislation."
"Let us not become confused over terminology - the report we have adopted is more about finding new labour resources than about solidarity."
"The demographic crisis is not something we found out about yesterday."
"Some of us have been drawing attention to it for a very long time."
"For years, we have been saying that Europe is ageing and dying."
"Now it is upon us and we are frantically looking for a solution."
"Cold logic offers us many."
"Putting back the retirement age, increasing the birth rate, bringing more women into the sphere of formal employment, and increasing the influx of immigrants and integrating them into our society."
"We are willing to do all of these, and the submitted report talks about all of these."
"However, I am not entirely sure it will help - and if so, for how long."
"This is because we are addressing not the cause, but the consequences."
"We are behaving like participants in a pyramid scheme, who see that the base of the pyramid is starting to stagnate."
"We are looking for new players to expand the base."
"However, by deliberately giving a new meaning to words like 'solidarity' or 'work-life balance', we are destroying genuine solidarity and taking children away from their parents."
"Despite this, I voted in favour of the submitted report."
"I see it as an important contribution to the fundamental debate on the survival of European civilisation."
"Research makes a fundamental contribution to economic growth, job creation and the creation of clean, sustainable energy."
"I am in favour of increasing research funding in the European Union as it is vital to set up a European Research Area which will guarantee the highest standards of excellence, effectiveness and efficiency in research in order to attract and retain the best scientists in Europe and promote an innovative European economy based on knowledge and expertise."
"Europe must invest in research to develop new products and services which will enhance the quality of citizens' lives."
"I voted for this framework programme because I believe that it encourages the research community, academia, civil society organisations, companies and the industrial sector to participate in research projects."
"Research and development are two major challenges for the future of the European Union in the current global context."
"I therefore supported the European Parliament's initiative aimed at simplifying the implementation of the European Union's framework programmes for research."
"My fellow Members and I have thus estimated that the European Commission communication on simplifying the implementation of research framework programmes proposes serious and creative measures aimed at removing the obstacles encountered by participants in the framework programmes."
"This is about boosting the trust that European funding has in the candidates and about making them more risk-tolerant in relation to participants at all stages of the projects, with flexible European rules."
"The resolution reflects the fact that the current system is excessively control-oriented, which results in wasted resources and in low participation."
"Finally, we welcome the overall trend towards shortening the average time-to-grant and time-to-pay in spite of further progress that can still be achieved."
"I support strongly what this report says on taking action for simplifying the implementation of the EU framework programmes for research."
"Red tape and onerous administrative and regulatory conditions add to the complexity of the application process and contribute to the difficulty faced by small organisations and by small and medium-sized enterprises trying to get funding for the research in which they are engaged."
"Since the research community itself is asking that the rules be adjusted, the procedures and requirements simplified, and more trust placed in EU research funding, it is quite clear now that there is a need to streamline the funding and administration of research to ensure that research and innovation are effective and widespread across Europe."
"This simplification and effectiveness would positively affect the research situation in the EU, and would be beneficial for stakeholders as well."
"I support Parliament's demand for implementing a simplification process for the purposes of stability and legal certainty."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted for this report."
"Science, education and innovation are pillars of economic growth and job creation."
"Europe must invest in innovation if it is to develop new products and services."
"These will create new sources of employment and growth, something that will both render Europe more competitive and improve its quality of life."
"For some time, the research community has expressed concern that the implementation of research programmes and the development of innovations is not proceeding as swiftly as hoped because of particularly complex bureaucratic requirements."
"This is a particular problem for smaller organisations, such as SMEs, high tech start ups and smaller institutes, universities and research centres."
"There is a real demand for improvement and streamlining of research funding and administration."
"At present, there are different rules and procedures for different instruments of the framework programme, and this severely impedes stakeholders' opportunities to submit applications."
"I agree that in debating the Eighth Framework Programme for research, most attention should be paid to the simplification of administrative procedures to ensure uniform interpretation and application of rules and procedures used in all programmes and instruments."
"The European Union is very well aware that research and innovation are the key to the future where they will not only create new products, but also new jobs and resources and, by extension, economic growth."
"This development will definitely help boost Europe's competitiveness and, consequently, improve the quality of life."
"In these circumstances, the increase in red tape associated with accessing the funding for those involved in research and innovation programmes will only help dampen and reduce the enthusiasm of those participants who are already showing signs that they have started to lose confidence in this process."
"The current system should be replaced by a system which inspires more confidence in applicants."
"One positive step would be to simplify the process for monitoring projects' financial and administrative aspects, while also consolidating the scientific and technological assessment process."
"It should be possible, to start with, to simplify the administrative control process, which will inspire greater confidence in the scientific and business communities."
"A balance needs to be struck between confidence and control and between taking risks and the dangers risks involve in order to ensure that research funds are managed properly."
"I offer my congratulations on the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mrs Carvalho."
"I am firmly convinced that science, innovation and research are the main drivers of economic growth and job creation in Europe."
"It is no accident that research and innovation lie at the heart of the Europe 2020 initiative."
"It is therefore time for Europe to invest more in these areas: to compete on the world stage, the European Union must develop innovative products and modern services."
"As a result, the number of applications for funding is increasing on a daily basis, meaning that a general simplification of the financial accountability requirements is needed, together with harmonisation of the currently highly diverse rules and procedures."
"I voted in favour because I agree that we need to respond swiftly to the research community, which has been clamouring for these changes."
"I endorse the approach taken by the rapporteur of basing the funding system not on results, which may lower the scientific ambition of researchers, but on scientific criteria and, hence, on excellence."
"Administrative simplification is one of the major priorities that Europe must address, and greater internationalisation of the framework programme may create new opportunities and possibilities for cooperation with third countries, including developing countries."
"This report proposes the simplification of monitoring financial aspects and the strengthening of technical and scientific evaluation by a peer review based on excellence."
"However, the report marks only the beginning of a process that is not simple."
"The implementation of the recommendations will be up to the Commission, and it will need to be followed up and receive political support from Parliament and the Council if it is to carry out this task successfully."
"In future, the simplification process may be extended to other European programmes, notably the Structural Funds."
"Programmes which have simpler rules will also be more transparent and more efficient."
"I would also like to thank my colleagues, Mr Cerexhe of the Belgian Presidency, Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn, and all those who contributed to the public consultation for their assistance."
"It is imperative to simplify access to funds for research, developing a culture of evaluation based on a partnership of trust between all those involved so as to strengthen research and innovation in Europe, making it an attractive place to live, work and be happy."
"Research and development are crucially important to achieving the goals to which the European Union has committed itself under the Europe 2020 strategy."
"European programmes in the field of research and innovation have been increasing significantly in recent years, both in terms of applications made to them and in terms of their budgetary allocation."
"However, it is difficult for small and medium-sized organisations to handle the complexity and bureaucracy inherent to these programmes."
"Accessing the programmes and preparing proposals are still very difficult, especially for those new to them; the administrative burdens for administering projects and accounting are considered too high; and the average time between the awarding of the subsidy and payment remains too long."
"The mechanisms involved in the research framework programmes therefore urgently need to be updated and simplified, in order to simplify the monitoring of the projects' financial and administrative aspects while reinforcing the process of scientific and technological evaluation I welcome the European Commission's initiative to reverse this status quo, and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Carvalho, on the excellent work she has done in proposing concrete measures to improve the current system."
"The economies of scale achieved by the European Union's research framework programmes are among the most significant contributions made by EU institutions to the welfare and long-term growth of the Member States."
"That, however, is not enough at a time of intense international competition like the present."
"It is always necessary, in fact, to monitor results, assess the feasibility of opportunities and maintain close relations with the scientific community, which renders society an enormous service."
"Cutting down on red tape and thereby streamlining tendering procedures would allow researchers to focus on their own professional goals, through the use of resources and skills that would otherwise be wasted."
"We should not forget that these funds are paid out to be used efficiently."
"While merit is an essential component of efficiency, it is unacceptable that research should be hindered because researchers have to deal with bureaucratic requirements of doubtful value."
"I voted for this important report, which aims to simplify the rules relating to the financing and implementation of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)."
"There is a wide consensus in favour of this report as such, as simplification is essential to improving the competitiveness and impact of research in Europe."
"In a Union whose strategy is focused on developing a knowledge economy, it is essential for Europe's main instrument for financing R&D to respond directly to the needs and concerns of the scientific community: â¢ for making the programme more accessible; â¢ for a more attractive European Research Area; â¢ for a greater focus on excellence; â¢ for a stronger basis of support for technological innovation and for transferring technology to European companies."
"The report gives the Commission clear guidelines and options for simplifying the FP7."
"The Commission should continue this effort in the preparation of the future Eighth Framework Programme, making the user central to it."
"European research cannot continue to bear the weight of the procedural errors that have affected the framework programmes up to now."
"I voted in favour of simplifying the implementation of the research framework programmes, given that it is a fundamental aspect of facilitating scientific and educational development."
"This, in turn, can help create new jobs and boost economic growth, thereby increasing the EU's competitiveness and improving the quality of life of its citizens."
"The current system should be replaced by a system which inspires more confidence in applicants."
"The rise in the number of applications for funding has been met with the increase in control mechanisms, in an attempt to ensure that EU funds are used properly."
"A balance needs to be struck between confidence and control and between taking risks and the dangers risks involve in order to ensure that EU research funds are managed properly from a financial perspective."
"One other reason why I voted in favour of this is also as an encouragement to new Member States in Eastern Europe so that they have the easiest possible access to the relevant funds, with the aim of raising the level of research to Western standards."
"I voted for this report because I believe that there were certain shortcomings with the implementation of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for research which prevented it from being put into practice in the ideal conditions."
"I think that this proposal from Parliament will provide the solutions needed to simplify the procedures for allocating grants and to get small entrepreneurs and those recently entered in the system more involved, as well as increase synergy between the FP7 and other European funds, including the Structural Funds."
"I voted in favour of this report because I argue that research makes a fundamental contribution to economic growth, to job creation and to environmental sustainability."
"Alongside the simplifications it has proposed, the European Union should create a detailed plan for developing research infrastructure in the various Member States, in order to ensure equal opportunities in accessing finance."
"First of all, I should like to congratulate Mrs Carvalho on the work she did on this report and on the vote obtained, both in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and in this Chamber."
"Naturally, this success was the result of her work and commitment to the issues of innovation, research and science."
"I know that research and innovation make essential contributions to economic growth and job creation, which are essential to the EU's economic recovery in the current situation, and also contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The official discourse of incentivising research and innovation is not enough to achieve this."
"As the rapporteur says, recently '13 000 researchers put their name to a petition requiring more simplification and trust in EU research funding'."
"That is why, as the rapporteur says, it is important to move towards administrative and financial simplification."
"This report points out a route to be followed: I hope that is what is done."
"It is vital that we provide incentives for researchers and investors to stay in Europe."
"Combating the brain drain must remain a priority for the European Union."
"To do so, we must reshape and simplify the administration and funding of research framework programmes."
"Financial resources must be allocated more directly, benefiting our businesses, universities and research laboratories."
"The excessively control-oriented funding system for research results in a waste of resources."
"As highlighted by the report, the overall trend must be towards shortening the average time-to-grant and time-to-pay in order to encourage further participation in these research programmes."
"It is critical that we throw off the administrative straightjacket that holds back the effective functioning of these programmes."
"in writing. - With the growth of the European research and innovation programmes and those applying for funding, it is important that those who are applying for it will not be bogged down with the process and this move to simplify the programme is much welcomed."
"My vote in favour of this report is based on three factors."
"The first is the connection with my previous activities."
"I mentioned the particular attention focused by citizens on research in the field of early detection and prevention of cancer."
"It has become obvious that research is vital for improving people's lives, provided, however, that there is a visible link."
"I therefore considered that this report, aimed at simplifying the way in which funds are granted for research, development and innovation via the Seventh Framework Programme, deserves to be supported."
"The second factor relates to the importance I personally attach to SMEs as key components in economic development and the development of the European Union's global competitiveness."
"The report's provisions on providing access to information and facilitating the involvement of SMEs by developing the 'one face to the customer approach' and the Open Access Pilot, and on running information campaigns, made me welcome this report and give it my vote."
"Last but not least, I welcomed the contributions regarding the future Eighth Framework Programme, which must be more transparent, flexible and easily accessible."
"The proposals made in the report on how to simplify, explain and assess the results are commendable."
"It is essential to simplify access to the framework research programmes in order for there to be motivation for potential interested parties to access them and for important funds not to be squandered."
"We cannot forget that research makes a vital contribution to economic growth, to job creation, and to sustainable and environmentally friendly energy."
"It is therefore time to coordinate national, regional and European research policies, so that there are not considerable obstacles to obtaining cost-effective solutions."
"That being the case, we need to move towards greater simplification and harmonisation of rules and procedures, as simplification is not just an isolated objective, but is rather a means of ensuring the attractiveness and accessibility of EU research funding."
"There is increasing despondency among researchers, research institutes, universities and businesses with the research framework programmes due to the complex nature of the European Commission's tendering procedure."
"However, the 2020 strategy aims to improve the framework conditions and access to funding for research and innovation to ensure that innovative ideas can be turned into goods and services creating growth and jobs."
"Therefore, in the interests of efficiency and with a view to promoting the highest quality research, it was highly desirable to simplify the implementation of the research framework programmes."
"We had to take these measures to remain attractive in order to attract and keep the best scientists in Europe and remain competitive in a global economy."
"I welcome the draft report which intends to promote a balance between trust and control, between risk taking and risk prevention, while ensuring sound financial management."
"I agree that we must simplify the funding of these programmes, but on one condition - after the result has been achieved, it must be available free of charge to all EU countries."
"Otherwise, what will happen is this - one EU nation will carry out the research project with EU Structural Fund money, with common EU resources, therefore, but then, after it has obtained the result - be it a new product or new technology, it will sell it to other EU Member States."
"This is unacceptable."
"It is important that all who provide funding should be able to dispose of the results of research projects carried out with common EU funds free of charge."
"During the economic crisis which developed out of the financial crisis, between EUR 4 billion and EUR 5 billion from the EU budget was redeployed to energy projects from other subsidy funds which still had money available in order to aid the recovery of the economy."
"As the Commission explained in its presentation of the 2020 energy strategy, an investment of EUR 1 trillion is needed to develop the outdated power grid in Europe over the next few years."
"It is to be expected that consumers will have to pay the cost of this, rather than the energy sector."
"An important factor in this respect will be energy research, providing that it focuses on the genuinely more cost-effective technologies."
"We must bring an end to the emphasis on nuclear power which, in addition to posing the risk of environmental catastrophes, is by no means cost-effective when the cost of expensive terminal storage, a problem which has not yet been resolved, is included."
"We must devote our attention to green technologies."
"I have voted in favour of the report."
"The report aims to simplify procedures and reduce costs."
"It will also create incentives for an increase in the involvement of the private sector."
"For this reason, I have voted in favour of this report."
"We live in a global economy, where competition is no longer represented by local, national or European businesses."
"Our businesses, researchers, scientists and universities all find themselves having to compete on a global level with markets that have enormous amounts of resources available to them, often with very much lower costs than our own."
"Therefore, we need to invest more in innovation and research and less in largely unskilled manual labour, as our costs will never be competitive with those of the new economic powers."
"We need to create new, high level positions, promote sustainable mobility, improve education and technical skills and coordinate them with the needs of the labour market."
"I hope that the next framework programme makes all necessary resources available to ensure that the European Union is a leading light in this sector, that it is always at the cutting edge, and that it is able to attract resources and human capital."
"This is truly the challenge for the years ahead."
"I enthusiastically welcome the adoption of this report, since, as it deals with promoting research and innovation, which are engines of the European Union's current and future growth, it gives voice to the common sentiments of the people most affected by it: the need to simplify and monitor the financial and administrative aspects of projects, whilst simultaneously strengthening the scientific and technological evaluation process."
"This European Parliament report must be given due consideration during the required simplification of the Seventh and Eighth Framework Programmes for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration, and of all programmes promoted by the European Commission in the field of science and research."
"I welcome the simplification measures already introduced by the Commission in the implementation of the Seventh Framework Programme, and I support the Commission in its efforts to achieve greater simplification and clarification of the rules, so as to avoid giving rise to discrepant interpretations and to reduce the risk of error, thus cutting audit costs."
"The current rules are in need of simplification and clarification."
"The excessive numbers of research bodies, cooperation models and management mechanisms that have grown up and the resultant complexity, which creates problems of transparency in relation to the budgetary authority and differences in the treatment of beneficiaries, are to be regretted."
"Science, education and innovation are pillars of economic growth and job creation."
"Europe must invest in innovation if it is to develop new products and services."
"Research and innovation are at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"However, it is particularly difficult for smaller organisations - SMEs, high-tech start-ups and smaller institutes, universities and research centres - to cope with the procedural complexity involved in accessing the funds earmarked for this sector."
"The scientific community is urgently calling for harmonisation of the rules and procedures and for a general simplification of the financial accountability requirements."
"Recently, 13 000 researchers put their names to a petition requesting greater simplification and trust in EU research funding."
"It is certainly necessary to simplify the mechanisms involved in the framework programmes for research, technological development and demonstration activities, FP7 and FP8 and all the European Commission science and innovation programmes."
"I believe that far more research activities are needed to measure the impact of environment and climate policies on employment and I ask the Commission to make this area a priority as part of the Eighth Framework Programme."
"I should like to start by stressing the excellent work done on this report by my colleague, Mrs Carvalho, giving me an opportunity to publicly congratulate her."
"Given the crucial role played by research in economic development and job creation, it is important to avoid at all costs excessive bureaucracy and unjustified delays which prevent the scientific community from participating."
"I therefore welcome the simplification proposals put forward in order to promote the attractiveness and accessibility of EU research funding."
"Since 1984, the successive framework programmes for research and technological development have evolved considerably, while growing in terms of both budget and the number of areas covered, which is certainly a positive thing."
"They have also done so, however, at the cost of such complexity in the rules for participation that the cooperation of our best researchers is at serious risk."
"The report covers the demands of the scientific community in a comprehensive and exemplary manner, along with the conclusions of the seminar on simplification organised by the Spanish Presidency in February."
"This is why I have voted in favour of a report that consolidates a series of principles and lines of action such as closely linking this matter with the future of the financial perspectives after 2013, the tri-annual review of the Financial Regulation and the application of tolerable risk of error in the area of research, all of which will be fundamental for preparing the Eighth Framework Programme."
"There is, however, also another series of less significant simplification measures that we can introduce into the current framework programme by way of good practice that will not only facilitate the participation of the current beneficiaries, but which I am convinced will also strengthen that participation."
"in writing. - We in the Greens/EFA Group supported the report mainly because it includes some of our key issues such as civil society organisations."
"See the Buzek report on the Seventh Framework Programme, Amendment 278 (Annex I, Chapter IV - Capacities - Research for the benefit of SMEs - Activities - paragraph 1, indent 2a (new)): support civil society organisations or networks of civil society organisations in commissioning research from research performers; open standards; decrease loss of time for researchers in bureaucratic processes; simplification is essential for all small actors, including SMEs, but civil society organisations should not be forgotten; open science and repositories (reference to the Berlin Declaration); seek complementarities between the FP and the CIP; international cooperation with developing countries may require specific rules."
"I welcome the report in that it aims to support the research sector, with the prospect of economic growth, by simplifying the procedures for implementing EU programmes."
"It is important to streamline the stages of programme access, in line with the principles of transparency, simplicity, consistency and legal certainty, to facilitate matters for small and medium-sized enterprises, universities, research institutes and local bodies."
"Creation of a web portal for research participants will enable them to quickly access programme information and will improve coordination with third countries through the exchange of best practices."
"I endorsed the report on simplifying the implementation of the research framework programmes."
"Without simplification of the administrative formalities for the tendering and implementation procedure, there will be no growth in participation of the private sector in the framework programmes."
"Taking into account the key criterion for evaluation - the cooperation of industry with science - projects which do not include the participation of partners from the small and medium-sized enterprise sector have a poor chance of being undertaken."
"In addition, one of the most commonly occurring problems is the selection of foreign partners for projects."
"Greater help from the Commission is still essential here."
"The most important barrier to building an innovative economy is the fact that people do not know of the existence of the Seventh Framework Programme - or that they are afraid of it."
"The complicated procedures are making many institutions concentrate mainly on obtaining support from structural funds."
"The current achievements of Polish groups (according to the evaluation of the Polish National Contact Point on the basis of data supplied by the European Commission) are not very satisfactory."
"The success rate for the participation of Polish groups is 18.56%, while for subsidies granted, it is 13.72%, compared to the EU average of 22.28% and 20.56% respectively."
"This is a great loss for Polish science, which has at its disposal a huge research potential as well as superb scientific staff."
"Better use should be made of the opportunity presented by FP7."
"Simplifications in the implementation of FP7 will contribute to an increase in the innovativeness and competitiveness of the EU economy in the global economic arena."
"Today, we are voting on an important document about simplifying procedures for accessing framework programmes for research and innovation."
"Simplifying and standardising the legislative framework of European research programmes is a choice we have to make."
"Indeed, science, education and innovation are the foundations for economic revitalisation and the creation of new jobs."
"We need to invest in research and innovation if we want to focus on new products and services to make Europe more competitive and, at the same time, improve European citizens' quality of life."
"Over recent years, the European research and innovation programmes have become notably broader in scope."
"This has also brought an increase in rules and administrative procedures which, in turn, have caused greater difficulties in participating in European tenders."
"Through this document, we are urging the European Commission to remove these obstacles and urgently begin simplifying the rules for accessing research funding."
"I voted in favour of the resolution, hoping for greater procedural uniformity in order to allow easier and more open access to European funding, which often remains largely unused, partly because of procedural difficulties."
"in writing. - (LT) Ladies and gentlemen, there cannot be innovations without research competence."
"Innovation linked to cutting edge science and education is one of the engines of job creation and economic growth."
"Europe must invest in innovation if it is to develop new products and services."
"Therefore, as the rapporteur rightly observes, it is important for us to help simplify the mechanisms involved in the framework programmes for research."
"The coordination of rules and procedures and the simplification of research funding and administration are long overdue."
"It is difficult for the majority of smaller organisations (high tech start ups or universities and research centres) to cope with the complexity of the current rules."
"According to this year's European Innovation Scoreboard, which compares the innovation performance of all EU Member States, Lithuania's rates are below the EU-27 average."
"However, it demonstrated good progress and has great potential - Lithuania has one of the fastest Internet connections and one of the highest mobile phone penetration rates in the world."
"Therefore, it is very important to continue to invest in the development of technologies and improve the implementation of national and European digital agendas."
"This will make Europe more competitive and will improve quality of life."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her many-faceted and highly successful report."
"She highlights a number of areas for improvement with regard to simplifying the administrative processes."
"I was happy to vote in favour of this report."
"I would like to add one brief point which I often hear about from small and medium-sized companies in the area which I represent, and that is the language issue."
"Many companies which are entitled to apply for European subsidies and whose ideas will bring added value on a European scale do not have the necessary language skills to go through the application process in English."
"In the Seventh Framework Programme guidelines, under the heading 'Tips for a successful application' the following text appears: 'Although it is possible to submit an application in any of the official EU languages, applications should always be submitted in English'."
"This means that a project with an application which is not in English does not have a chance, even if, for example, the common working language of the group of companies in question is not English."
"In order to reduce the administrative work involved for the companies at which these subsidy programmes are aimed, the EU Commission should change the way in which the project applications are examined by their experts, so that at least during the initial stage, the project documentation can be submitted in one of the Commission's three working languages."
"I voted in favour of the report because we cannot weigh down our top facilities with an unsustainable administrative burden if we want our support for European research to be effective."
"However, the text of the resolution and the debate on it have again confirmed my belief that public funds should be used to secure basic public services; other activities, including research and entrepreneurial activities, should be financed from private sources."
"The role of this Parliament should be limited to two areas."
"The first is the creation of a basic legislative framework to facilitate this type of business."
"If we are asking in the resolution today for a simplification of the mechanisms and instruments used in the current system of public grants, we are solving the result and not the cause of the problem. This is because public grants are the problem."
"The second area is respect for the rights of EU Member States."
"If some states ban the use of human embryos for research purposes, such research should not be financed from the common resources of the EU."
"It is like taking money from a committed non-smoker and using it to subsidise tobacco cultivation."
"I am in favour of simplifying support for research."
"It seems to me that we should aim to create a favourable environment for those who want to invest in new technologies and innovations, rather than discussing eligible costs and accounting procedures."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because livestock farming is going through an extremely difficult time as a result of increased animal feed prices."
"We are probably on the way to another commodities bubble."
"Prices on the international market have already increased by more than 16% on average since June."
"Never has there been so much negotiating on the futures market, nor has there been so much money involved."
"Extremely low interest rates and too much money in search of good deals are leading to an increase in dealing and financial speculation on futures contracts, without any contact with the real economy."
"The figures for the largest cereals exchange in the world, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, are impressive."
"Transaction records are being broken in purchases of soya, maize and wheat."
"The practical result is the transfer of these increases to real market prices, even in a year when cereals are widely available."
"These increases in animal feed prices are causing terrible damage to the already difficult situation of many of our livestock farms, which will be unable to pass on the increases in what they sell because of the crisis and are unlikely to be able to absorb them."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted for this report."
"European producers must comply with the most stringent regulations in terms of food safety and quality, the environment, animal health and welfare and labour conditions, which adds significantly to producers' costs, leaving them at a competitive disadvantage vis-Ã -vis third country producers."
"The livestock sector in the EU is facing serious problems, including the rising costs of inputs, such as fuel and fertilisers, the high cost of complying with EU regulations, greater competition from third country imports and the low prices being received by producers for meat products."
"To protect European producers and this important sector of the economy, the European Commission must ensure that the post-2013 CAP is adequately financed, in order to guarantee the viability of all EU farmers, including livestock farmers, and that the conditions exist for fair competition."
"I voted for this resolution on the crisis in the livestock sector because I believe that the market management mechanisms in the livestock sector need to be strengthened."
"With this in mind, measures need to be implemented to limit the impact of price volatility and speculation."
"I believe that market instruments must guarantee an appropriate supply of cereals for providing animal feed."
"In this regard, the European Commission should propose flexible market mechanisms for providing a swifter response."
"In my view, it is important for the European Union to have an instrument for assessing market trends globally."
"The new European External Action Service could provide an extremely suitable instrument capable of helping anticipate strategic changes in third countries and promote the European agricultural model all over the world."
"I wish to end by pointing out that an assessment of the economic impact of introducing new welfare regulations must be carried out and current legislation should be fully enforced before introducing new regulations."
"The market economy model developed in Europe over the decades should make us proud."
"With regard to the primary sector, the transition in many regions from an economy based primarily on arable and livestock farming to one based essentially on services has been correctly managed."
"The management of this transition has been underpinned by public intervention designed to ensure income stability for companies and to exclude food prices from the pressures of competition."
"Many lives can be saved, and a marked saving made in healthcare spending, through the adoption of healthy, balanced diets."
"The statistics also bring new issues to everyone's attention."
"I am referring to the safeguarding of food supplies, a factor to which everything else is inevitably connected, and to the quality and balance of the foods that will be available on the market in the coming years."
"I must mention the incomes of the thousands of families who live off the proceeds of these activities subsidised by the EU."
"I welcome the fact that this report addresses the main problems in the livestock sector, and I am sure that satisfactory results will continue to be obtained for the sake of public health and European consumers."
"Food market trends in recent years have been characterised by a series of paradoxes."
"One of these is that, while shelf food prices have been rising, farmers, including livestock farmers in the EU, are facing an income crisis which is threatening the existence of their farms and reducing them to poverty."
"We must be aware that the high quality standards imposed on livestock farmers come at a cost."
"In the case where competition from imports from third countries, which do not impose the same high standards, is not kept under control - let me remind you of the incident involving the milk powder from China infected with melamine - these costs will cause a drop in EU production in this area."
"Inadequate gestures are being made for the livestock farmers' benefit."
"This is why the Commission's intention to release a quantity of feed cereal is just one step aimed at helping the sector which must be followed by others as well."
"Consequently, I believe that the recommendations contained in the resolution, if adopted by the Commission and applied, will meet the demands of livestock farmers."
"Hence the reason I voted in favour of it."
"European producers are at a competitive disadvantage in relation to producers from third countries as their production costs are higher, largely due to the requirement to comply with the extremely high standards in terms of animal health and welfare, food security, environmental protection and working conditions."
"Given this fact, I believe that the European Commission must actively guarantee an adequate supply of cereal for providing animal feed."
"The role of rural development is essential to keep our territories alive, both because of its end product and because it is so widespread."
"Seen in this context, the livestock sector is one of the most significant for our communities."
"Indeed, beyond food and economic aspects (though important, and in which regard the quality of the products is ensured by environmentally sustainable techniques), farming represents the most widespread form of occupation, protection and development of rural areas."
"This is why the European Union - including through the common agricultural policy, above all, in its post-2013, reformed incarnation - and each Member State must promote its continued existence, not only by coming up with innovative techniques for farming and economically and environmentally sustainable management, but also by strengthening their wider role as guardians of the environment and the land protecting them from the market crisis by reducing production costs, making the best of their products and greater organisation on the market."
"It seems to me that the report on the crisis in the EU livestock sector that we have voted on works along these lines."
"The markets should be governed by the reality of stocks and needs and not by speculation; that is the message that the European Parliament wants to send to the European Commission by adopting the resolution on the crisis of livestock farming in the European Union."
"For Parliament, the next reform of the common agricultural policy will have to take into consideration the issue of farmers' income, which is increasingly subject to the consequences of speculation on commodities and to distributors abusing their dominant position."
"Beyond the one-off response to the sharp rise in cereal prices that prompted the crisis of livestock farming, Parliament wishes to raise the issue of the place that the European Union wants European agriculture to have in the global market, namely, produce with strict standards that are imposed on our commercial partners in order to have fair competition."
"As I have warned many times, the EU's excessive regulation could quickly end up becoming a factor which exacerbates competitiveness in certain sectors, livestock being one of these."
"I cannot forget hearing a British farmer talking in this Chamber about the difficulties he felt when he saw that meat from his animals was unable to compete on the market, such were the requirements imposed on him by legislation."
"That is the risk we are running and it is well identified in this proposal."
"It is also clear that the sector's crisis could result in a significant drop in meat production throughout the EU, leading not only to the disappearance of small and medium-sized producers, but also to a market supply crisis, increased prices and greater dependence on imports."
"I cannot forget milk production, which is an important issue for Portugal, so I would remind you that the policy of former Commissioner Fischer-Boel regarding milk quotas was severely criticised, and firmly and persistently opposed by farmers."
"For that very reason, I again urge the Commission to review this issue."
"The resolution that has been put to the vote acknowledges the serious crisis being experienced in the livestock sector, made worse by increased cereal prices, and calls on the Commission to table proposals for measures that could support the sector."
"It also calls on the Commission and Council to ensure that the common agricultural policy after 2013 will have sufficient funding to ensure the viability of all the EU's farmers."
"However, by defending guidelines that caused the problems currently faced by the sector, particularly small and medium-sized producers, it shows itself to be profoundly contradictory, and even contrary to the interests of these producers."
"The resolution once again advocates subjecting farming and food production to competition and the free market."
"It also warns of the speculation on foodstuffs that has been taking place, but limits itself to calling for excessive speculation to be fought and therefore believes that speculation on foodstuffs can continue, provided that it is not excessive."
"For our part, we have said it before and we are saying it again: it is necessary to break with a system that sees food as if it were just another commodity and allows speculation on foodstuffs; this leads to explosive situations of food dependency and price volatility, as has been occurring."
"The crisis in the livestock sector has been particularly influenced by the increase in cereal crop prices (above all, in Italy and Spain, since in countries like the United Kingdom, grazing livestock is most widespread) and the consequent rise in the costs of production."
"The downward trend in the sector is also partly due to the volume of imports from third countries."
"The problems in the sector could put food safety in the EU and provisions of meat for its citizens at risk."
"I therefore agree with the contents of this joint motion for a resolution, upon which I shall be expressing a favourable vote."
"In particular, I believe that we need to introduce market control mechanisms and pay greater attention to the content of the bilateral agreements concluded with third countries, such as in the recent Mercosur case."
"Many livestock farms in the European Union are in a difficult situation."
"This is primarily due to a considerable increase in the price of cereals and, consequently, of feedstuffs."
"For this reason, it is important for us to take measures which will help livestock farmers to emerge from this difficult period in a stronger position."
"In addition to the rise in the feed price, two points are particularly important to me."
"The first is that the high European product and safety standards which our livestock farms have to comply with must be applied to imported products that are sold in the European Union."
"This would help to ensure that European farmers are not at a major competitive disadvantage to producers in third countries and, at the same time, would guarantee that all the products sold in the European Union are of high quality."
"The second point is about making agricultural policy simpler and more transparent."
"Unnecessary regulations take up a lot of time and cost a lot of money."
"Therefore, it is important that they are removed."
"This would really make life easier for all the farms within the European Union."
"The motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development includes a number of good proposals of this kind which will bring about a permanent improvement in the situation of livestock farms."
"I am expecting to see these reflected in the Commission's future activities."
"I am disappointed that Amendments 1 and 2 were adopted by a majority in Parliament."
"Despite the self-inflicted interruption in supplies, we must not allow our agricultural industry to be contaminated with GMOs."
"The acceptance of unauthorised GMOs and the establishment of a threshold 'for adventitious GMOs which are not yet authorised in the European Union', and which have not yet undergone full scientific testing, have resulted in a flood of authorisations of GMOs in the USA and, in particular, in developing countries."
"On account of the testing capacity in these countries, this leads to an increased risk of damage to health and the environment."
"Countries outside the EU now have an increasing influence over authorisation practices within the EU, with the result being an ongoing decline in the health and environmental safety levels of authorised GMOs."
"In addition, with regard to Amendment 3 that has been adopted, I am not of the opinion that the current ban on meat and bone meal for non-ruminants should be reviewed."
"This would increase not only the potential risk presented by genetic engineering in agriculture, but also the potential risk of a new outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)."
"However, I believe that this report plays a useful overall role in highlighting the crisis in the livestock sector within the EU."
"The current situation in the livestock sector is very difficult and some areas are unprofitable because of the high production costs."
"On the one hand, farmers are being paid lower prices by consumers, while on the other, they are faced with major fluctuations in feed prices."
"It is important for us to prevent a serious crisis occurring in the livestock sector by making immediate use of the available instruments to stabilise the market."
"Another factor which has an impact on European farmers is the growing competition from third countries where production costs are lower and the increasing tendency in trade policy to exchange larger quantities of food imports for services, without at least requiring the same production standards."
"I support the resolution which calls for specific measures to be taken on behalf of the livestock sector."
"I would like to thank Mrs Herranz for her initiative."
"Against the background of the difficult market situation and the discussion which has been initiated about the future of agricultural policy in the EU, Parliament needs to make a clear commitment to giving all areas of agricultural production the necessary security to allow them to plan for the future."
"European farmers have been living in a state of serious crisis for some time now."
"I voted in favour of the resolution precisely in order to get started down a path which will shortly lead to a re-stabilisation of incomes for those people who have made livestock farming their life's work."
"Only people who believe in their work put up with what are now grave conditions, frequently living in often difficult circumstances and having to buy their means of production at very high prices."
"In this vein, allow me to express my heartfelt sympathy for all those farmers in the areas of Italy hit by flooding of late, with the hope that the resolution voted on today may also contribute to their recovery, affording them a satisfactory way of life and work."
"The European livestock industry is currently undergoing a major crisis, because rocketing production costs are pushing European producers closer and closer to their survival threshold."
"These very high production costs are directly related to high feed prices and our dependency on third countries for our cereals and protein plants."
"I expect the Commission to include in its forward-looking legislative proposal on the future of the common agricultural policy (CAP) efficient market instruments and the necessary funding to ensure that the feed and cereal market remains stable and to guarantee livestock farmers the security to plan for the future."
"We also need a European protein plan which will promote the cultivation of protein and leguminous crops and reduce the dependency of the dairy sector with regard to this strategic type of feed."
"In addition, we need to reinforce the measures to support livestock farming in disadvantaged areas, including Luxembourg."
"The Commission should take a cautious approach in its proposals on milk production, because 70% of the red meat produced in the EU comes from dairy cows."
"In Europe, we have the strictest animal welfare and hygiene regulations in the world."
"Therefore, I am of the opinion that the same requirements must apply to imported foods, in order to reduce the competitive disadvantage for our producers caused by unfair competition."
"The livestock sector bears the consequences of stringent regulations required by our institutions, the most stringent in the world in terms of food safety and quality, the environment, animal health and welfare."
"Unfortunately, the crisis in this sector is now having a negative effect leading to a significant loss in revenue for producers, to which we cannot be indifferent. The very least that we should promise, and it is what producers rightly expect, is the reciprocity of these regulations on imports."
"When, sooner or later, food safety is a matter of global concern, Europe must react to maintain the viability of livestock farming when it is under threat."
"This investment in the future is vital."
"This is why the economic impact of the regulations required, namely, legislation on animal welfare, must be assessed and incorporated into long-term planning for the future of the agricultural sector and the livestock sector in particular."
"I am voting for this resolution because the increasing costs of the factors of production and the costs inherent in compliance with EU regulations are currently making the profitability of European livestock farming unviable: the prices obtained by some farmers for basic meat-based products are below production cost."
"The European agricultural sector is sacrificed in favour of the possibility of the EU exporting other types of product to these countries from a great variety of economic sectors, but mainly from the livestock sector."
"This resolution advocates measures that could end up helping to combat the crisis in this sector, which is being damaged by speculation on the commodities market, as well as by scrupulous compliance with EU regulation."
"The crisis in the livestock sector is not only the result of rising production costs."
"A modern society requires healthy food and high standards of hygiene and animal welfare which can be found in small-scale farming businesses and organic farms."
"These cause an increase in production costs and consumers then choose cheaper products."
"While our domestic farmers are subject to strict regulations, it is difficult to monitor the standards which apply to cheap agricultural imports."
"This is why we need fair prices and a change in the agricultural subsidy system."
"We must move away from supporting multinational agribusinesses and large-scale hobby farmers like the Queen and instead support small farmers who can only survive by running their farms on a part-time basis alongside another job."
"This report does not deal with this problem in sufficient detail and, therefore, I have abstained."
"I happily voted today in favour of the resolution on the crisis in the EU livestock sector."
"It called for vital measures to be taken to support the livestock sector in the European Union by focusing attention on the volatility of feed prices and adopting measures so that products imported into the EU meet the same requirements as those met by European goods."
"The problem with the state of the livestock sector is prevalent across the whole EU."
"The livestock sector is faced with the widest variety of challenges: rising feed prices, market speculation, increasing energy prices and growing expenditure associated with the enforcement of European regulations."
"All of these factors have made production in Europe more expensive."
"These difficulties apply across the board to all livestock farmers throughout the European Union."
"However, there are additional difficulties on top of these, which some new Member States are facing, such as my country, Bulgaria, for instance."
"In Bulgaria, only 10% of livestock farmers own their land, which consequently means that only these 10% can benefit from direct payments."
"This situation is exacerbating the crisis in Bulgaria's livestock sector."
"Due to the lack of funds to buy the quantities of feed needed for the winter, many Bulgarian farmers will be forced to slaughter their animals."
"I voted in favour of the important resolution on the livestock sector in the hope of improving the lot of livestock farmers and the whole sector, which is in crisis due to strong speculation for a rise in animal feed prices."
"My vote in favour is aimed at supporting all livestock farmers facing bankruptcy."
"With this resolution, Parliament is calling on the European Union, pending adoption of the changes to the common agricultural policy, to release a small quantity of stored grain for animals in order to lower the costs for farmers, while curbing the current strong speculation and imposing tougher price controls to protect the agricultural market."
"This motion for a resolution on the crisis in the European Union's livestock sector came out of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), and has involved several of my colleagues and me, personally."
"We are concerned that European producers in this sector are experiencing severe hardships and we are determined to take action in the hope of helping to overcome this difficult period."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, because it is a loud call for help for this sector, and because I am convinced that the action now started could make a real contribution to the sector's sustainability and development."
"From this resolution, I would stress the call for the interests of European workers to be safeguarded in the context both of the post-2013 common agricultural policy and of bilateral negotiations, especially with Mercosur."
"Of the advocated measures, I would stress: effective and flexible meat-market mechanisms; combating speculation on cereals and the creation of a safety net in this sector; adequate protection of farm workers in the most disadvantaged areas, and greater power for producer organisations."
"I voted for this resolution because I think that it is a good idea to call attention to the crisis that the livestock sector is currently experiencing and its consequences."
"I hope that the measures necessary to guarantee the sector's sustainability and development will actually be adopted."
"The motion for a resolution on the crisis in the livestock sector which has been adopted by the European Parliament calls for the introduction of new market management mechanisms in the livestock industry and of safety nets in all the cereal sectors."
"I oppose these market interventions."
"However, the motion for a resolution also includes important liberal requirements for pragmatic thresholds for GMOs in imported feeds and a review of the ban on feeding meat and bone meal."
"Therefore, I did not vote against the resolution, but instead abstained in the final vote."
"In order to guarantee a supply of feed for the European livestock sector, we must relieve farmers of their burden of red tape and create a framework of legal certainty."
"A market focus in the agricultural industry will also mean that farmers can take responsibility for their own businesses and need not expect constant protective interventions in the market to be made by politicians."
"If agricultural policy is based only on individual interests, the result will be a spiral of exemptions which it will not be possible to finance and which will distort the market."
"This will turn farmers into the victims of a bureaucratic, state-run control system."
"In order for the market to function effectively, we need a clearly defined framework for the entire agricultural industry and not just for individual areas."
"This resolution on the livestock sector is yet another call by Parliament to take into account the growing difficulties faced by our European farmers."
"With farmers having to comply with more and more rules on traceability, hygiene, animal welfare and respect for the environment, their production costs are now spiralling out of control: fuel, fertilisers and, above all, cereals, currently amount to 60% of the total cost."
"We call on the Commission and on Commissioner CioloÅ for more measures to curb price volatility and to create a safety net."
"Our livestock farmers must survive the pressure of imports and work within a market where competition is fair."
"As nobody pays to work, quite simply we want to enable them to make a living from their profession."
"in writing. - As Greens, we have participated in negotiations on a joint resolution on this topic."
"The result is not overwhelming, as other groups insisted on pointing to high environmental and animal welfare standards as the reason for lower competitiveness in the EU livestock sector."
"They also would not agree to take climate change issues related to livestock production into consideration."
"However, the resolution refers to the demands adopted in the BovÃ© report and calls for measures to curb speculation and price volatility, as well as pointing out the key demand of the HÃ¤usling report for a crop protein plan to reduce dependence on protein crop imports (mainly GM soy) and the specific needs of extensive grassland beef production."
"Just as the foundations for the new common agricultural policy are being prepared, in the hope of keeping European agribusinesses competitive in comparison with those from third countries, which enjoy the undoubted advantages of more land and appreciably lower labour costs, a new threat has arisen for our livestock farmers in the form of a huge increase in the cost of animal feed linked to the rise in cereal prices."
"The Commission needs to adopt measures to calm cereal prices to prevent the market from being affected by their excessive volatility."
"I am not able to support the motion for a resolution because we do not need more aid for the agricultural sector."
"Agricultural aid already accounts for nearly 40% of the total EU budget."
"Furthermore, the motion for a resolution contains absolutely no criticism of the common agricultural policy, which really needs to be reduced before 2013, when the next multiannual financial framework is to be decided."
"I abstained from the vote on the resolution."
"The agricultural sector does not need any more subsidies."
"It devours more than 40% of the total EU budget."
"The resolution fails to take a critical view of the basis for the common agricultural policy system, which absolutely must reduce its share of expenditure ahead of the 2013 decision on a new long-term budget."
"I kept an open mind during the reading of the initial motion for a resolution on the crisis currently faced by the EU livestock sector which, in particular, condemns the lack of transparency within the food supply chain turning producers and consumers into the weak links in the chain, the extreme market volatility faced by the EU dairy sector, in particular, and distortions of competition between EU producers and those from third countries subject to less demanding regulations on food quality and safety, and which reiterates the need for effective market regulation and for a strong budget for the common agricultural policy after 2013, However I ultimately condemn the adoption of this resolution and, in particular, Amendments 1, 2 and 3 which open up the way for genetically-modified soya and maize from third countries on European soil and a return to meat and bone meal in the food of non-ruminants where food safety cannot be guaranteed."
"That is why I have taken on board my responsibilities in voting against this joint resolution as it goes against the precautionary principle, which should guide us all."
"The livestock sector in the European Union is under serious threat, largely as a result of the recent increase in cereal prices."
"The effect on livestock farming of speculation coming from the cereal sector is worrying."
"It is not just market volatility associated with the economic crisis that we are experiencing, but there is also a serious threat of disturbance in all branches of the livestock sector, making the adoption of a series of genuine measures capable of combating the crisis that we are witnessing urgently required in order to prevent future negative developments."
"As well as the necessary technical rules on food safety and animal welfare, it would be desirable if other improved measures capable of preventing the current situation developing into something more serious could be implemented, for example, the release of cereal stocks stored in intervention, in order to make it possible to minimise the issue of price volatility and prevent the delicate situation that we have been witnessing from getting worse."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the food sector is one of the priority sectors both for Lithuania and the whole of the European Union."
"We have already seen what can happen to energy supply and prices when the EU is dependent on imports."
"This must not be repeated in the food sector."
"Livestock holdings have faced a serious threat from the recent increase in cereal prices in the EU, as well as extreme climatic conditions and speculation."
"This means that certain EU sectors, such as the pigmeat sector (an important branch of Lithuanian agriculture), have suffered a blow due to feed prices, which represent up to 60% of all production costs."
"EU livestock production systems are important for maintaining livelihoods."
"Lithuania may face serious consequences as a result of the crisis in the livestock sector."
"The agricultural sector, which employs around 8% of our workers, is an important part of our economy."
"Wheat and other grains are the principal areas of production."
"In the EU-27, there are more than 130 million livestock units."
"According to EU statistics, the number of livestock has fallen by 25% since 1990."
"A further drop in the number of livestock in the EU may cause significant changes in production, which would upset the supply of food in the EU."
"Such fluctuations may cause serious disturbances in the livestock sector."
"I am against asking the Commission, as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe want to do, to reconsider the ban on the feeding of meat and bone meal derived from non-ruminants."
"That ban needs to remain in place for two reasons."
"First of all, the ban was not imposed for nothing; it was introduced to stop the BSE crisis."
"We know that we would be taking a certain risk if we were to lift this ban."
"I do not want that to happen."
"I am much more in favour of food safety for consumers: not taking a risk when you do not know how big it is and what impact it could have."
"Secondly, we have seen in recent years that viruses that occur in living animals can rapidly mutate."
"If we were to lift the ban on the feeding of meat and bone meal derived from non-ruminants, we would risk encouraging this process of virus mutation."
"We must not do that."

"It was with great satisfaction that I received the news concerning the release from house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the Burmese opposition."
"Mrs Suu Kyi was one of the first winners of the Sakharov Prize, awarded by the European Parliament since 1988."
"However, she was unable to collect it in person 20 years ago."
"I would like to inform you that I have already sent Mrs Suu Kyi an invitation to visit the European Parliament and to address one of our plenary sessions."
"25 November is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, as instituted by the UN 11 years ago."
"Every day, all over the world, many women are victims of rape, humiliation and domestic violence."
"A particular atrocity practised in many areas of the world is the circumcision of young women."
"It is estimated that 8 000 girls fall victim to this every day."
"To show solidarity with the campaign to stop this barbaric ritual, I would encourage you all to wear a rose petal today to symbolise our opposition to this practice."
"I would also like to stress that the European Parliament has continued in its efforts to appeal for a complete stop to physical and mental violence against women for many years."

"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 18 November 2010 pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"Monday:"
"The political groups are proposing to remove the debate on Mr Berlinguer's report on civil, commercial, family and private international law aspects of the action plan implementing the Stockholm Programme from the agenda."
"As a result, the report would be subject to a direct vote tomorrow, on Tuesday."
"The report will stay."
"There will be a vote, but no debate."
"I repeat: all the political groups have agreed to this solution and this solution has thus been accepted."
"(Parliament agreed to the request)"
"Tuesday:"
"No amendments have been proposed."
"(DE) Mr President, on the agenda for Tuesday, there are six reports by Mrs Matera concerning mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in the Netherlands."
"I am taking the floor on this because I think that the way Mr Daul has been attacked on this matter in the Dutch press is not right."
"At the Conference of Presidents, Mr Daul raised the question that had been discussed by the heads of the various groups concerning whether these reports should not be dropped in the light of the budget debate."
"I would like to make two comments on this."
"Firstly, we should leave these reports on the agenda."
"We should also vote them through and transfer this money from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to the Netherlands."
"Secondly, however, Mr Daul suggested it in a comment made at the Conference of Presidents."
"If it is then taken from the Conference of Presidents into the public domain without him even being given an opportunity to answer questions and explain it himself, then, as the chair of a group, one has to consider very carefully what in fact one can say at the Conference of Presidents."
"That is the first point."
"My other point is that it is not the European Parliament that is claiming that money is being squandered here."
"It is an element of the Dutch Government - not all of it - that is constantly claiming that money is being squandered in Europe and therefore Europe should get less money."
"The Matera reports show that, on the contrary, money from this budget is being used very responsibly and - in my opinion - for very important projects in the Netherlands."
"Consequently, adopting these reports would show that the criticism in the Netherlands in respect of this budget is not justified."
"(Applause)"
"I am aware of the matter and I know what has appeared in the Dutch press."
"However, I would like to assure you that the vote on mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for the Netherlands will proceed tomorrow as planned."
"Nothing has changed."
"Voting will take place tomorrow."
"Wednesday:"
"I have received a request from the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left concerning the debate on the situation in the Western Sahara, namely, that voting on the motions for a resolution on this matter should take place during this session and not the December session, as is currently intended."
"(PT) Mr President, the situation in Western Sahara is serious enough for Parliament to hold off on taking a position on this matter."
"The facts are undeniable and are plain to see."
"We have seen images of destruction in the Sahrawi camps, and we know that this destruction has resulted in deaths and injuries, with many people still missing."
"We know that a Member of this House was prevented from going to the camps and was expelled by the Moroccan authorities, and we know that the same thing has been happening with members of national parliaments, journalists and members of non-governmental organisations (NGOs)."
"Knowing all this, we cannot simply ignore it."
"Not taking a position on this matter would now be an incomprehensible and unacceptable attitude of complacency, and even complicity, and it would only detract from the dignity of this institution and the values it claims to defend."
"I would therefore like to call upon everyone to make the sensible decision of supporting the vote on a resolution on this issue during this sitting, voting in favour of this proposal."
"Mr President, I think the arguments given by the GUE/NGL Group are absolutely relevant, important and necessary, so I will support this position."
"Mr President, I must ask Mr Ferreira to pay attention for a moment."
"We discussed this topic in great depth at the Conference of Presidents and during the preparations for the Conference of Presidents."
"On behalf of my group, I would like to say that we are very concerned about what is going on in the Western Sahara."
"If the pictures that we have seen are accurate, then this must give rise not just to serious debate, but also, if necessary, to consequences."
"This means that we must proceed properly, however."
"Proceeding properly includes discussing the events this week."
"At our request, the Moroccan foreign minister has now stated that he is prepared to attend a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"He does not have to do that."
"The Moroccan foreign minister does not have to appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament."
"As far as I am concerned, we should take advantage of the fact that he is doing so in any case to first confront him with the reproaches made, and only then adopt a resolution."
"I believe that is a much more proper way to proceed, rather than adopting a resolution now and then listening to what he has to say afterwards."
"Let us adopt the resolution in the light of the information and the questions that we will have the opportunity to ask the Moroccan foreign minister in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I personally consider that a more proper way to proceed."
"Moreover, until this afternoon there was consensus on that among all the groups."
"The request has been supported by the majority, so in accordance with Mr Ferreira's proposal, voting will take place this week."
"(Parliament agreed to the request)"
"I will give you the deadlines: the vote will take place on Thursday."
"The deadlines are as follows: motions for resolutions must be tabled by 12:00 tomorrow, 23 November; amendments and joint motions for resolutions must be tabled by 12:00 on Wednesday, 24 November; amendments to joint motions for resolutions - by 13:00 on Wednesday, 24 November, in other words, an hour later."
"I repeat: the vote will take place on Thursday."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to ask my fellow Members something."
"There is an emergency situation in Tibet and concern about China's intention to impose the Chinese language on Tibet."
"I believe that this is an issue that deserves a debate in plenary with Baroness Ashton present."
"It is really the policy currently being enacted in Tibet that is problematic, quite apart from this emergency situation."
"An emergency?"
"Very well."
"If the majority wants to tackle this issue from that perspective, that is fine."
"For my part, and since the agenda is fairly clear in December, I would like us to hold a debate on this problem and on the European Union's policy regarding China with Baroness Ashton present, and to adopt a resolution on this matter."
"I think that would be more intelligent."
"Many thanks, Mr Cohn-Bendit."
"This can also be proposed to the Conference of Presidents."
"As a group chair, you may propose this at any time, Mr Cohn-Bendit."
"Thank you for your comment."
"Thursday:"
"No amendments have been proposed."
"(The order of business was established)"
"ECB annual report for 2009 - Latest developments on international currency exchange rates (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following:"
"the report by Mr Balz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the ECB annual report 2009, and"
"the Commission statement on the latest developments on international currency exchange rates."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just had a request for everyone to quieten down a bit."
"Perhaps certain Members could comply with that request."
"Ladies and gentlemen, my report today essentially concerns the performance of the European Central Bank in 2009 - in other words, during a period in which economic, financial and, increasingly, also political actions, were substantially dominated by the economic and financial crisis."
"The crisis, which started off as a purely financial crisis, spread, and also affected the entire real economy in a second wave."
"Economic activity diminished worldwide, while falling tax revenues and increasing welfare expenditure as a result of the crisis led to increasing public deficits."
"Further measures to stimulate the economy also contributed to the level of debt."
"As a result of these increased deficits, governments throughout the European Union passed extensive austerity packages."
"In my opinion, these packages were necessary and, in some cases, even overdue."
"However, they constrained the capacity of the governments to act."
"Although economic activity began to recover in the second half of 2009, the financial and economic crisis then threatened to evolve into a public debt crisis in a third wave in 2010."
"In my view, this danger has not yet been averted."
"In recent days, we have been reminded all too clearly by the case of Ireland that the problem of over-indebtedness in the Member States has by no means been resolved, and I therefore also agree with President Van Rompuy: the failure of the euro is out of the question."
"That is the current situation, however."
"My report deals instead with 2009, about which we can say that the ECB reacted appropriately - even well, in fact - to the challenges."
"Its measures proved to be widely successful and kept many financial institutions from collapse."
"However, the financial institutions did not always pass on the liquidity in full to the real economy, with the result that the full recovery potential of these measures could not be exploited."
"Since these measures involved extraordinary steps, it is now essential that the measures are lifted judiciously and with careful planning."
"The problems in Greece and other euro countries may be, in part, home-made, but they also brought to light fundamental problems that existed within the economic and monetary union."
"The principles of the Stability and Growth Pact were infringed."
"We are now living through the consequences, and that includes what is going on in Ireland."
"These infringements must now be removed and new infringements must be prevented."
"The Stability and Growth Pact needs to be strengthened, and the economic and monetary union needs to be more in balance."
"In the past, insufficient coordination of economic policies within the monetary union allowed considerable economic imbalances to arise between the euro area countries and left the euro area without a predefined crisis management mechanism."
"The euro area will have to resolve these imbalances if it is to prevent a new crisis."
"In the final event, however, the structural reform process - combined with the revision of the regulatory framework for financial policy - may strengthen the euro area."
"The issue of the independence of the European Central Bank will also be a significant aspect of the new economic governance, particularly as regards the recently established European Systemic Risk Board."
"Consequently, Parliament will continue to take its duty to review the performance of the ECB very seriously."
"I am absolutely convinced that the European Union and the euro area will find a way out of this crisis and could emerge from it even stronger than before."
"However, in the coming months, we need to learn the right lessons from what has happened."
"This is a major challenge, but in its history to date, the European Union has constantly demonstrated that it develops best when it has to overcome challenges."
"This crisis therefore also represents an opportunity that we should exploit."
"In closing I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups for their extremely pleasant and constructive cooperation on this report."
"It is not something that can be taken for granted, but it deserves particular emphasis in this case."
"Mr President, Mr Balz, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour of presenting to you, as provided for by the treaty, the European Central Bank's Annual Report for 2009."
"Due to the schedule having been somewhat thrown out by the European elections in particular, I spoke to you last March about the previous annual report."
"This is therefore the second time I have addressed Parliament this year."
"First of all, allow me to say how pleased I am about the support once again expressed by the European Parliament's motion for a resolution in favour of regular hearings before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, more generally, in favour of maintaining close relations with the European Central Bank."
"I welcome this even more since, this year, the European Parliament has demonstrated very convincingly its willingness and ability to assert the overriding European interest, especially with regard to the financial supervision package."
"(DE) I would like to start by giving you a brief overview of the monetary policy measures taken by the European Central Bank during the financial and economic crisis."
"Beyond the crisis period, I would also like to look back on the ECB over the first twelve years of its existence."
"Finally, I would like to look at the most pressing challenges that await us in 2011."
"Mr President, let me first mention the action taken during the crisis."
"2009 was a most challenging year for the ECB's monetary policy."
"It started with a severe economic downturn worldwide following the outbreak of the financial crisis in autumn 2008."
"In this environment of subdued inflationary pressures, we continued with our policy of lowering our key rates further."
"Overall, within a period of only seven months - between October 2008 and May 2009 - we lowered our main refinancing rate by 325 basis points."
"This brought our main refinancing rate to 1%."
"To ensure that households and firms in the euro area would benefit from these most favourable financing conditions, in 2009 we also continued with - and even extended - our enhanced credit support to euro area banks."
"We did this in response to dysfunctional money markets that had weakened the ability of monetary policy to influence the outlook for price stability by means of interest rate decisions alone."
"Among those non-standard measures - as we used to call them - the most prominent is the full allotment liquidity provision through our refinancing operations with euro area banks against good collateral and at the main refinancing rate prevailing at the time for several maturities extending well beyond the weekly operations."
"In 2009, we also extended the maturity of our longer-term refinancing operation to one year."
"These were, of course, decisions of extreme importance."
"As rightly emphasised in your draft resolution on the ECB's annual report, this enhanced credit support has been successful in avoiding what would have been - if additional dysfunctional tensions had been observed - a depression or a much deeper recession."
"Let me emphasise that all our action was fully in line with our mandate to deliver price stability in the medium term for the euro area as a whole."
"That we have been able to credibly deliver on our mandate is reflected in a favourable inflation outlook and well-anchored inflation expectations in the euro area."
"Following some improvements in financial market conditions in the course of 2009, renewed market tensions erupted in a number of segments of the euro area bond market."
"Since the smooth functioning of the bond market is essential to the transmission of the ECB's key interest rates, we decided to intervene in the euro area's debt security markets with the aim of helping restore a more normal transmission of monetary policy to the economy."
"To this end, we introduced our Securities Markets Programme."
"To ensure that this programme does not impact on our monetary policy stance, we re-absorb all the liquidity injected."
"To sum up, let me emphasise that all the non-standard measures we have adopted during the period of acute financial stress are temporary in nature and were designed with exit considerations in mind."
"Some of the non-standard measures initiated in 2009 and early 2010 have already been phased out in view of improvements in conditions in some financial markets and taking the ongoing recovery of the euro area economy into account."
"Let me share with you for a moment a few thoughts on the track record of the euro."
"In my view, three elements are fundamental."
"Firstly, the ECB has delivered what it was expected to deliver according to its treaty mandate, namely, price stability."
"Indeed, euro area average inflation over the past almost 12 years stands at 1.97%."
"This fully reflects our definition of price stability, namely, our aim to keep annual inflation rates in the euro area below 2% and close to 2% in the medium term."
"In this sense, the euro system over the past 12 years has operated as an anchor of stability and confidence and has done so during the most recent times, despite the challenging environment created by the global financial crisis."
"Secondly - and reflecting favourably on the credibility of the ECB's monetary policy - inflation expectations have, as I have said, remained solidly anchored at levels in line with price stability."
"Thirdly, this success is grounded, we trust, in the full independence of the ECB from political influence, in its primary mandate to maintain price stability and in its transparent communication, particularly concerning the definition of price stability."
"The ECB's two-pillar monetary strategy allows for a forward looking and medium-term oriented course of action that is underpinned by a solid analytical framework."
"That framework includes a thorough analysis of monetary and credit developments, taking the monetary nature of inflation over the medium to longer term into account."
"We consider that this comprehensive approach allows for well-informed and consistent decision making, whilst being steady and looking beyond short-term volatility."
"As regards the external dimension of the euro, let me only say that our currency has established itself internationally."
"In 2009, the euro represented around 30% of the stock of international debt securities and the stock of global foreign exchange reserves."
"Speaking of the external dimension of the euro, I will say a word on the present foreign exchange rate issues, domains where I would call for great prudence."
"There are two major topics."
"One is the relationship between the major floating convertible currencies of the industrialised countries, such as the dollar, the euro, the yen, the pound sterling and the Canadian dollar."
"These currencies have been floating since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system at the beginning of the 1970s."
"I should underline the strong view of the international community that excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability."
"Let me say that the ECB appreciates the recent statements by the US authorities, namely the Secretary of the US Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, reiterating that a strong dollar vis-Ã -vis the other major convertible currencies is in the interests of the United States."
"I share this view entirely."
"A dollar that is credible among the major currencies of the advanced economies is in the interests of the United States, of Europe and of the entire international community."
"The second topic concerns the currencies of emerging market economies which have current account surpluses and exchange rates that are not sufficiently flexible."
"On this issue, the international community agrees - and this was restated in Korea last week, as well as by the Commission - that moving towards more market-determined exchange rate systems, enhancing exchange rate stability to reflect underlying fundamentals and refraining from competitive devaluation of currencies are in the interest of the emerging economies concerned and of the international community."
"The ECB used to say that this is no time for complacency."
"This is truer now than ever."
"The challenges lying ahead of us are manifold."
"All relevant authorities as well as the private sector must assume fully their responsibilities, and this is true for executive branches, central banks, regulators, supervisors, the private sector and the financial industry."
"In particular, the current crisis has clearly demonstrated that implementing ambitious reforms in economic governance is in the interest both of the euro area countries and of the euro area as a whole."
"The proposals put forward by President Van Rompuy on the reform of the EU's economic governance and approved by the European Council meeting of October 2010 represent an improvement to the current surveillance framework at EU level and seem broadly appropriate for the EU countries not participating in monetary union."
"However, as regards the specific requirements of the euro area, in our opinion, they fall short of what we view as necessary to ensure the best possible functioning of the single-currency economy."
"I am convinced that, over the coming months, the European Parliament will help Europe make the necessary quantum leap in economic governance a reality."
"With its legislative role concerning financial supervision and the ESRB, Parliament has shown its determination when it comes to major issues."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for this and to express again my conviction that the influence of Parliament will be decisive in the economic governance debate."
"Another important challenge relates to financial regulation."
"We should take full advantage of the lessons of the crisis and maintain the momentum for financial reform."
"As advocated in your draft resolution, a speedy implementation of Basel III is of crucial importance."
"The Commission's legislative proposals on short selling and over-the-counter derivatives are also indispensable to making the financial system more transparent and resilient."
"We are facing a decisive year."
"2011 should see the adoption of the revised governance framework, in-depth discussions on the crisis management framework and possibly the launch of the procedure for a treaty change."
"We need to get all these reforms right, so as to ensure that Europe as a whole and the euro area can meet future challenges with even greater capacity and conviction."
"2011 will be also the first year of the existence of the European Systemic Risk Board."
"As is called for in your draft resolution, we are doing our utmost to support the new body."
"At the same time, of course, the complete independence and the primary mandate of the ECB, enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty, are unchanged, and I have already stressed this point before Parliament."
"We will continue to deliver on our mandate."
"This is what the treaty requires from us."
"You can trust that we will deliver what our fellow citizens expect."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first thank the rapporteur, Burkhard Balz, for the solid and comprehensive report on the ECB annual report 2009."
"The Commission welcomes the report, which reflects the key issues appropriately."
"The report recognises and praises the work done by the ECB in managing the crisis."
"The Commission shares this view; the ECB, under the leadership of President Jean-Claude Trichet, has navigated in this difficult situation skilfully and with a steady hand."
"I want to use this opportunity to thank Jean-Claude Trichet for an excellent cooperation and especially for his crucial role during these turbulent times."
"The ECB has, both through its monitoring stance and its non-standard measures, been instrumental in the fire-fighting to overcome the crisis and thus in laying the foundations for sustainable growth and job creation."
"Your report rightly stresses that the financial crisis has exposed the need for reinforced economic surveillance in the euro area."
"The Commission agrees with this, which is precisely why we have put forward several legislative proposals to reinforce economic governance in the EU, especially in the euro area."
"We have also taken on board several suggestions presented in the Feio report to strengthen and broaden economic governance in the Union."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has received the Commission's proposals and is currently working towards achieving the ambitious deadline of June next year, which I appreciate and welcome."
"Let me now turn to the second part of the debate, which is the latest developments in the international exchange rates."
"It is correct that volatility in foreign exchange markets has increased in recent weeks, with significant shifts in the value of major bilateral exchange rates."
"The euro appreciated against the dollar since June this year due to stronger data for the euro area economy and due to further expansion of the US monetary policy."
"More recently, however, the euro has somewhat weakened against most currencies, as increased worries about the Member States' public finances - above all in Ireland - have affected the euro."
"In real effective terms, the euro is currently close to its long-term average following an overall depreciation this year from an overvalued level at the end of last year."
"Compared to the beginning of the year, the euro depreciation in real effective terms amounts to around 7%."
"In the context of a slow recovery in advanced economies and large capital flows to emerging economies, many countries have aimed at weakening their currency or at least resorting to competitive non-appreciation."
"It is therefore important that leaders in the G20 Seoul Summit last week very clearly and strongly committed themselves to abstain from competitive devaluations of their currencies."
"The G20 summit also agreed to work further on the rebalancing of global growth."
"An agreement had been reached to work on indicative guidelines."
"It is clear that exchange rate flexibility must play a role in the necessary rebalancing so that exchange rates reflect economic fundamentals, as was underlined by President Trichet."
"The Commission will continue to support this important strand of G20 work, which will also be one of the key focuses of the French G20 Presidency next year."
"Finally, I need to inform you about an important development concerning the euro area."
"Yesterday, when the ECOFIN Council welcomed the request of the Irish Government for financial assistance from the EU, ministers concurred with the Commission and the ECB that providing assistance to Ireland is warranted to safeguard financial stability in Europe."
"EU financial support can be provided under a programme with a rigorous policy conditionality which is being negotiated currently with the Irish authorities by the Commission and the IMF, in liaison with the ECB."
"The programme will address the fiscal challenges of the Irish economy in a decisive manner and the programme will also include a fund for potential future capital needs of the banking sector."
"To redress stress in the banking sector, a comprehensive range of measures including deleveraging and restructuring will need to be taken to contribute to ensuring that the Irish banking system performs its role properly in the functioning of the overall economy."
"The technical talks on an EU-IMF programme are now well under way and the negotiations can be concluded by the end of November."
"Apart from EU and IMF financing, I can inform you that the United Kingdom and Sweden have indicated that they stand ready to contribute to the programme through bilateral loans, which is welcome."
"All in all, yesterday's decisions are a critical step forward in the joint efforts to stabilise the Irish economy and thus safeguard financial stability in Europe."
"Mr President, Mr Trichet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, clearly, I join the chorus of praise for the ECB's work, and I shall not repeat what my colleague, Mr Balz, said or what is said in the resolution."
"In the short time allotted to me, I would simply like to say that we must consider our fellow citizens."
"Why do I say that in this way today?"
"Because, yesterday evening, on all the French television channels, a future presidential candidate made a spectacle of himself by tearing up a EUR 10 note that he had photocopied and enlarged, and showing that, by tearing up that note, he was tearing up the cause of all our ills."
"Of course, that is not true."
"All that is needed is for us to make an effort, together, to communicate."
"The work that has been carried out in terms of supervision, organisation and regulation, to which you have referred, Mr President, is excellent."
"You know you have Parliament's support: you said so yourself."
"However, we have a real task on our hands with regard to those of our fellow citizens who do not understand the messages that are being conveyed."
"Every day, the headlines in the press are of increasingly grim solutions and unlikely situations, and I can tell you that, on Friday, when I was out in the field, as we say in politics, I saw nearly 100 to 150 people."
"They all asked me the same question: what is going to happen with the euro?"
"The fear felt by our fellow citizens is out of sync with what is being done, and done well, by the European Central Bank."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Balz, for his cooperation."
"I also welcome the fact that the European Central Bank has been granted the status of an EU institution following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Secondly, I would like to point out that there are considerable macro-economic disparities between the economies in the euro area, highlighting the need for closer harmonisation between economic and monetary policies."
"The Growth and Stability Pact is not an adequate instrument for resolving the current economic imbalances."
"One solution out of this deadlock could be to issue government bonds at EU level."
"This solidarity mechanism would provide stable financing for Member States in dire straits, would make budgetary supervision more effective and would significantly improve liquidity."
"The single currency should be supplemented with fiscal tightening and joint long-term debt."
"The reckless behaviour of financial operators helped trigger the economic and financial crisis."
"In addition to this, the recent speculative attacks against certain Member States have made it difficult for the latter to borrow money on the international financial markets, thereby virtually affecting the stability of the whole euro area."
"I therefore think that a permanent mechanism is required to protect the euro area against speculative attacks."
"It is the European Commission's duty to monitor the activity of current credit rating agencies and to devise a structure for an EU-level credit rating agency."
"We must also bear in mind that the austerity measures adopted by national governments could significantly reduce the chance of the European economy's recovery."
"This is why an EU-level economic governance model is required which will combine fiscal consolidation with the creation of new jobs."
"The Commission must also propose specific targets for narrowing the competitiveness gap between EU economies and, last but not least, go ahead with investments in green energy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I join the chorus of praise for our rapporteur, who I think has outlined the issue very clearly."
"In his report, he stresses the innovations afforded by the Treaty of Lisbon, and I really want to thank you, Mr Trichet, for having once again this evening reminded those of us who seem to be unaware of the fact - including, incidentally, those who signed it and had it ratified - that the Treaty of Lisbon includes a major innovation: we are going to be able to debate publicly, in this Chamber, the reform of the Stability Pact."
"Under Mr Rehn, the Commission has drawn up a set of proposals that are on the right track and are rather courageous, especially in calling for discipline to be strengthened by taking account of the macro-economic imbalances that Mr Balz had, in fact, mentioned in his report."
"What is more, you refer several times, Mr Trichet, to a 'quantum leap', in other words, a real step forward in this governance."
"I agree entirely with what Mr GauzÃ¨s said; when one goes out into the field, one almost wonders whether the proposals put forward by the Commission in September are completely relevant, whether account ought not to be taken of the crisis that is currently occurring in order to allow for as much progress as possible to be made."
"I would like to point out here that those who designed the euro never thought that we would simply coordinate economic policies in the long term."
"What was envisaged was political union, namely, an ability to take decisions while being supervised by Parliament."
"For my part, what I find rather striking, when we speak to the citizens, is that we ultimately have motorists - the Member States - who are, at the same time, behind the wheel and by the side of the road acting as policemen."
"That is rather how the current system works; in other words, we are, at the same time, the driver, the person who issues fines and the person who is supposed to supervise the other cars."
"I do not think that there is a single country with road traffic like that."
"We would therefore like to raise the cost of fines a little and we shall work towards that."
"Thank you for having reminded us that we have already done so in practice with regard to the reform of financial supervision, in the general European interest."
"Mr President, firstly, on behalf of my group, may I express my thanks to Mr Balz for the cooperative manner in which our deliberations were conducted."
"We were able to contribute certain suggestions to make the report even more balanced."
"The period 2009-2010 was characterised by extraordinary measures on the part of the European Central Bank, and in view of these extraordinary economic developments, I would like to thank Mr Trichet once again for taking these measures, particularly since they were not always well received within his own institution."
"We have seen during this period that the Stability and Growth Pact is inadequate."
"Instead, we need effective coordination of economic policy that takes into account not just public debt but also private debt, and that deals with economic imbalances not just in deficit countries but also in countries making a surplus."
"Where prices are concerned we need to focus not just on consumer prices, but also on property prices, their speculative development and the creation of bubbles."
"Above all - and we are constantly urging this - we need once and for all a framework for tax competition in the European Union."
"It is unacceptable to have huge austerity programmes on the expenditure side while countries continue to have unconstrained tax competition on the revenue side."
"In particular, it is unacceptable - and impossible to explain to our citizens - that in such a situation as we now have, we are rescuing Ireland's banks, but not at the same time ensuring that its scandalously low rate of corporation tax, which stands at 12.5%, is corrected to the usual European rate of 25%."
"We need to have some straight talking here."
"I would also like to ask Mr Trichet to comment on two matters in the report: the issue of transparency, as mentioned in paragraph 21, and the issue of the security accepted, as mentioned in paragraph 39."
"You have not yet commented on these issues."
"On behalf of all the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, I would be grateful if you could comment specifically on these matters."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Balz on his report."
"However, at a time when the euro is facing new crises every day and it is generally accepted that new forms of governance and new rules are required for survival, it is hard for the ECB to weigh in on outside global issues."
"Yet that could be precisely the problem."
"Until now, most of the large global players have succeeded in working together to seek solutions to the problems of the global financial crisis."
"The coordination in areas of financial services regulatory reform, particularly in areas like derivatives, has been unprecedented."
"But when it is national currencies that are being defended as opposed to multinational banks, there is a strong danger that multilateral coordination is going to break down."
"If the ECB looks to protect the euro above all else, the Fed to protect the dollar and the Chinese the yuan, we will all lose out."
"Since its inception, the ECB has done the difficult job of balancing different cultures and methods of monetary policy."
"I hope that, even while it is under intense internal pressure, it can use its expertise in these areas to enhance cooperation beyond the EU to a global level."
"Madam President, I would first like to express my heartfelt thanks to Mr Balz for such constructive cooperation."
"I can only emphasise the fact that despite coming from different positions, working together was a positive experience."
"Many people thought - and I would like to underline this fact again here - that the crisis in the euro area was over."
"Ireland shows that this is not the case."
"Just as before, Europe is voluntarily offering itself up to the financial markets."
"The EU Member States are still having to offer their treasury bonds in the bazaar of the financial markets and try to gain the confidence of the speculators by adopting suicidal austerity packages."
"At the weekend, we saw once again where that leads us."
"This time it was not the Greeks, who were supposedly out to deceive everyone, but rather Ireland - the star pupil - that was forced to turn to the European bail-out fund in order to rescue its banking system - a system which had also long been held up as a shining example of deregulation."
"In the meantime, the financial sector is already eyeing up Portugal for capitulation as its interest rates continue to rise."
"The European Central Bank must share the responsibility for this drama."
"It has failed and continues to fail to use eurobonds in order to offer a civilised alternative to this casino approach."
"While half of Europe is recovering from the crisis, the ECB idly stands by as the remaining part falls further and further into poverty and uncertainty."
"Ruinous cuts across the board by national economies may be to the taste of the European investment and banking giants, but they do nothing to help either Ireland or the monetary union and the ECB."
"Please pay no attention to Mrs Merkel's simplified financial ABC, Mr Trichet."
"If you want to save the economic and monetary union, do not leave European treasury bonds hanging in the air."
"Introduce eurobonds before the speculators claim their next victim."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, I wanted to ask Mr Klute how his proposal for Europe-wide treasury bonds and eurobonds can be reconciled with the attitude of the German Federal Constitutional Court on such matters, and what he thinks the outcome would be were such a measure to be brought before the German Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe."
"(DE) Madam President, I admit that that is difficult to assess."
"I cannot give an off-the-cuff answer to that right now."
"Undoubtedly, it is a tricky situation, but I think that things have now developed so far that a rethink might possibly take place."
"I am sorry, but I cannot give an off-the-cuff answer to that question."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, I read the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' report on the European Central Bank's annual report with great interest."
"The report acknowledges that huge disparities between Member States of the eurozone contributed to the problems we are witnessing."
"The report states that 'these imbalances pose considerable difficulties for a suitable monetary policy within the eurozone' and reiterates that 'the financial crisis in some countries within the euro area is a serious matter for the area as a whole', reflecting this 'dysfunction of the euro area'."
"I strain to see the sense in calling for stronger coordination of economic policies within the euro area."
"The knee-jerk reaction has been to increase economic governance, but it is limitations of enforced commonality that have led particular Member States into financial crisis, combined with extraneous reasons as yet beyond our control."
"Perhaps the system does not allow for the necessary economic elasticity and self-determination to enable governments to deal with idiosyncratic problems effectively, such as rates of inflation."
"The report lights upon this point, noting that the crisis and subsequent bail-outs and stimulus packages 'led to far-reaching austerity measures which ... heavily constrain the capacity of governments to act'."
"One argument is that you cannot have a single currency without further homogenisation to iron out differences between Member States and levels of wealth."
"Yet any realist knows that this will not happen."
"It is contrary to human nature, which logically should shine forth in a democracy, however inconvenient."
"Is the eurozone ready for Estonia in January?"
"I raise my eyebrows at the statement that 'the adoption of the currency by Estonia shows the status of the euro', suggesting that this will 'encourage (other) Member States to seek membership'."
"Ideological clinging to the euro will see monetary problems resurface in boom time and bust."
"A single currency only works in a tight-knit federal environment."
"Perhaps, with this being the Commission's ultimate intention, they have put the cart before the horse."
"Although the UK is not in the eurozone, we suffer the effects of contributing to bail-outs and through the intricately entwined economics inside the Union, it is no use waiting for the 'I told you so' moment."
"It has already passed."
"(DE) Madam President, it would be good if this report by Mr Balz could be presented subject to a reservation, and that would be a reservation as regards memoirs."
"I think we might learn a lot more if you would present the chapter on the years 2008-2009 from your point of view, Mr Trichet."
"In the absence of such knowledge, we are working somewhat in the dark here, and there is reason to believe that there are many extraneous circumstances of which we are unaware at the present time."
"Nevertheless, you have stated that the longer-term financing measures have been extended once again, Mr Trichet."
"Perhaps that is a good thing."
"History will show us whether it was really such a good idea."
"We do not always have to point the finger straight away at Alan Greenspan."
"There is just something that I am concerned about, and that is that our citizens are simply not being told what this liquidity aid is actually being used for, and the lack of transparency as regards the way that the Irish are being forced - in many people's eyes - under this umbrella."
"We know that Ireland has already received EUR 130 billion, EUR 35 billion of which has gone to the subsidiary of a German business - Hyporealestate."
"Just why is so much pressure being piled on at present?"
"Why are we not in a position to say who the real creditors of the Irish banks are?"
"Is it my life assurance with Allianz?"
"Is it, in fact, the German banks, as is always being claimed?"
"If that is the case, are we not having the wrong debate here?"
"In which case, we should be honest enough to tell our citizens that it is they that we are bailing out, that it may be your own money that you made the mistake of investing in Ireland, in a banking world built on false foundations."
"This, of course, also raises the question of whether every Irish bank is really essential to the system."
"Why do we not have the courage to accept that one or other will fail?"
"The Leman Brothers solution cannot always be the answer."
"We need the risks to be distributed fairly, because a large proportion of the earlier gains undoubtedly went into the private sector."
"(HU) Madam President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the splendid job he has done."
"Since the European Parliament is the primary institution through which the European Central Bank is accountable to European citizens, I am very pleased about President Trichet's participation in this plenary, and also that he regularly engages in monetary discussion with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The financial economy is global in nature."
"The crisis, too, is global."
"It is precisely for this reason that the solutions to the crisis must also be global."
"We cannot ignore the fact that the Member States' economic and financial problems still affect the euro in all its aspects."
"I once again agree with the rapporteur."
"Unfortunately, the EMU has not complied with nor held Member States accountable for compliance with all the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This is why we speak of government debt growth, and this is why we now see a new wave of the crisis, which is a government debt crisis."
"I trust that the issues regarding the ECB's independence and its responsibility for decision making will be resolved in a reassuring manner, and that this, along with the reform programme aimed at creating a successful economic union, will help strengthen the European Union and the euro area within it."
"I am sure that we are able to learn from the crisis and from our mistakes, and that the crisis will create opportunities for us."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the euro is experiencing problems, but what convertible currency is not after the systemic crisis caused by crazy finance?"
"Government debt is a serious problem."
"Nevertheless, the increase in public deficits is a result of the public bail-out of private banks."
"What is more, the economy needed to be revived."
"The financial crisis has spread rapidly to the real economy, leading to a sharp downturn and unemployment."
"It appears that the world of crazy finance has not learnt from the crisis."
"Wall Street and City survivors are speculating on the currency markets and short selling CDSs that they do not even have."
"The lending rates for States it is suspected may default must be raised by indirectly imposing austerity policies on them, which will make it even more difficult for them to recover."
"European solidarity is being shown with difficulty and sparingly."
"The bail-out of Greece means, first and foremost, the bail-out of French and German banks holding a significant portfolio of Greek debts."
"The support given to Ireland is, above all, a bail-out of British and German banks that would suffer deeply if Irish banks were to go under."
"The fact that the rate of the euro remains volatile is not a sign that the common currency is weak."
"It is a reflection of the tension in the markets, especially in the face of a currency war between the Americans and the Chinese."
"Since the start of the year, China has no longer been borrowing in dollars, but has been selling them."
"The tax situation in the United States is worse than that in Europe."
"On top of federal public deficits, there are enormous private deficits."
"Forty-eight of the 50 states in the American Union have a deficit budget."
"Mr Van Rompuy spoke about the euro struggling to survive."
"He is wrong."
"The euro, that beacon of stability that Mr Trichet has just spoken about, will outlive Mr Van Rompuy, because the Union and its supporting structure, the Euro Group, are the most important economic unit in the world."
"In spite of real problems, to which Europe is responding with continual shilly-shallying, it should be pointed out that, at world level, the 27 are the biggest exporters of goods, the biggest importers of goods, and the biggest exporters of services."
"We have the most solvent internal market in the world."
"Furthermore, European companies export twice as much within the internal market as they do to world markets."
"The Union is the main destination for third-country direct investments."
"Companies in the Union hold the biggest investment stocks worldwide."
"With 500 million citizens, or 7% of the world's population, the Union generates 30% of gross world product."
"The United States generates 25%, Japan 8% and China 8% of world product."
"Our European Union, which also provides 55% of world development aid, could have more of an influence if our leaders had a little more political courage, if they used Europe's strength."
"I will just end by saying that a strict and transparent framework must be imposed on international finance."
"We must work together to overcome our problems."
"Madam President, as has been highlighted by our colleague Mr GauzÃ¨s, some people hate the euro; they see it as the root of all evil and they cheer at the prospect of the collapse of the eurozone."
"But these people are wrong and they live in the past."
"The current troubles are not caused by the euro; on the contrary, the euro protects us from even worse."
"We need the common currency but we also need proper governance of the eurozone; loose cooperation on the basis of unanimity is not an option anymore."
"Colleagues, we are on a ship with a giant hole in its side; it is sink or swim at this moment."
"But national governments still seem to think that it is enough to set up task forces and working groups and talk about maybe seeking closer cooperation, and then again maybe not."
"The good news is that they seem to be acting more decisively and more quickly in the case of Ireland, because swift action is needed and very welcome."
"This is not just about rescuing single countries: it is about the credibility of the eurozone."
"It is about the world testing us."
"Are we willing and able to act?"
"The confidence of the world in the eurozone is essential for the stability of our currency; the money in our pockets depends on the confidence that others have in us."
"So I therefore urge national politicians to stop playing the populist card, or indeed publicly tearing up euro notes, and instead take ownership and take responsibility for our shared currency."
"Finally, a word about the austerity measures."
"They are much criticised, and some people even say that they will damage the economy."
"Of course we have to act with caution, but these measures are necessary to sanitise public finance in the long term and are also a sign of solidarity between countries in the eurozone."
"I think we should talk not only about the expenditure side but also about the revenue side, because there too, reforms - whether of the labour market, pensions or social security - are necessary and long overdue."
"(NL) Madam President, the European Central Bank has not known a year as eventful as 2009 since the euro was introduced."
"Tackling the crisis has cost a great deal of effort and this is still continuing."
"I think that we should have a better and stronger approach to tackling the crisis."
"The establishment of the European Emergency Fund is no structural solution."
"We will still have huge debts which countries like Greece or Ireland will never be able to repay."
"What really helps, however, are stringent, strict budgetary discipline and the accompanying automatic penalties."
"Fortunately, Mr Balz's report is very clear on that point."
"The Council should take the same approach in adapting the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Cutbacks are needed if we are to overcome the crisis."
"The majority of this House should also apply that principle to the European budget."
"The acceptance of the 2.9% budget increase is a very broad compromise already."
"No citizen will understand Parliament wanting still more and wanting further compromises."
"Therefore, do not do it!"
"(SK) Madam President, according to the minutes of the negotiations held between euro area finance ministers from the beginning of September this year, published by the Reuters press agency, you apparently stated, Mr Trichet, that if you had known that Slovakia would not agree to provide voluntary financial assistance to the Greek Government, you would never have agreed to Slovakia being accepted into the euro area."
"The project in question had the aim of protecting large financial institutions from extensive losses arising from Greece's inability to pay its debts, and, as far as I remember, you explicitly referred to it as a manifestation of voluntary solidarity."
"Perhaps, Mr President, in your daily dealings involving billions of euro, it has escaped your attention that the amount of money you receive each month for performing your role is enough to cover the monthly living expenses of almost 100 families in my country."
"Mr Trichet, if you really think that these families living on EUR 600 to 700 a month, or pensioners living on EUR 300 a month, should further reduce their daily food consumption only so that your colleagues from the banks and financial funds can keep their profits, pay out high bonuses and indulge themselves in ever greater amounts of caviar, then please do not call that solidarity."
"I know that the situation in Europe is very complex, but Slovakia is definitely not a country that you are in any position to criticise."
"(PT) Madam President, the intervention in Ireland ultimately proves that the EU should have come up with a common solution for European banks, particularly the large banks, almost before dealing with any other matter."
"In practice, today we are openly discussing the failure of states, yet we still do not have a clear proposal for a solution for European banks."
"The intervention in Greece and the way it has developed prove that Europe needs European solutions, and the solution identified thus far is principally based on bilateral aid, whereby every country is subjected to the judgment of its partners based on criteria that are neither clear nor stable."
"The European Central Bank (ECB) has acted as an anchor in this situation, filling some of the gaps, particularly in terms of the vulnerability of sovereign debt."
"Make no mistake, however: we cannot continue like this in the medium term."
"I would therefore like to ask the President of the ECB the following three questions."
"Firstly, what is the ECB's position on a stable model for constructing a true system of solidarity between the Member States with regard to sovereign debt?"
"We need this, and we should not refuse to face up to reality."
"Secondly, what were the differences, if it is possible for us to identify them, which prompted the ECB not to endorse all the recommendations of the report compiled by the task force led by Mr Van Rompuy?"
"Thirdly, does the ECB believe that the EU can survive with the increasing divergence of growth suffered by the Member States, and without a common instrument that restores some convergence in these growth strategies?"
"(GA) Madam President, as a Member for Ireland, I cannot say that I am too proud of what is currently happening in my own country."
"However, I am sure that most of our citizens want to do whatever needs doing in order to make things right."
"And to put things right in Ireland, two things are necessary."
"Firstly, unfortunately we have had to turn to the support from the ECB and the IMF in the short term."
"Secondly, and more importantly, the supervisory architecture of the authorities in Europe needs to work effectively so that the cosy relationship between dodgy banks, sleepy regulators and weak governments does not happen again in the future."
"Thirdly, I just want to ask people to lay off a little with regard to corporation tax because, firstly, it is a matter of subsidiarity; secondly, other countries in the EU have similar rates; and thirdly, it would exacerbate a very difficult situation in Ireland at the moment."
"(GA) So, I know that the people of Ireland are eager to get on with the job and that things will improve in due course."
"Madam President, Commissioner Rehn and Mr Trichet have given us more information here this evening than the Irish Government, which has misled us and lied to us for months."
"They have been more concerned to defend their historical legacy than to defend the future of our people's livelihoods, and indeed Ireland's and Europe's currency."
"My appeal to Commissioner Rehn and Mr Trichet tonight is that they ensure that the timeframe for aid and the targets for deficits and debt are such that the social objectives of Europe are taken into account, as well as the need to ensure that Ireland's capacity to grow its economy and create jobs is not undermined."
"Will you confirm also that you fully understand that increasing Ireland's 12.5% corporation profits tax is not a solution to Ireland's crisis, nor indeed Europe's current crisis, but could, in fact, create an economic and jobs wasteland in Ireland?"
"(SV) Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Trichet and Mr Rehn very much for their absolutely excellent work in these turbulent times."
"I have a very specific question for you both."
"Back in my country, which does not belong to the euro area, there is currently a discussion taking place along these lines: 'This demonstrates precisely what we said when voting against the euro in 2001."
"It shows that we were right - the euro cannot work'."
"This is, of course, an erroneous claim."
"I will therefore ask you two gentlemen a question."
"I believe that it is a key question and a key responsibility for the two of you to explain why Europe and the euro area have ended up in these difficulties."
"Is it because the euro area and the common currency have problems?"
"Or is it because we have a number of politicians in the individual countries, in other words, in countries such as Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece, who have not actually done their job?"
"Gentlemen, you need to explain this."
"Otherwise, I will never be able to explain it back home in my country."
"Madam President, I would like to put a question to Mr Trichet."
"As President of the European Central Bank, why have you and the European Commission utterly capitulated to the speculators and assorted sharks on the international financial markets?"
"You allowed them to engineer a panic in the markets over the Irish crisis - a panic designed to get you to intervene to guarantee the bond holders the billions that they gambled in bad debts."
"Because they threatened you that they would attack Portugal and Spain next, you and Commissioner Rehn utterly capitulated to a market dictatorship that is unelected, faceless and unaccountable."
"Can I ask you to justify this?"
"Private speculators and bondholders gamble tens of billions in private deals with private developers and private bankers in Ireland for private profit, and when the gamble fails, you support the pathetic government in Ireland to saddle working people, pensioners and the poor with the cost of this gamble."
"Now you have sent in the IMF as the shock troops for neoliberal capitalism to make the Irish people pay."
"Morally, and in every other way, they should not pay and they must resist this disastrous attack on their services, living standards and democracy."
"Madam President, my constituents in London simply cannot afford the GBP 288 estimated per family as their part of the contribution to the seven billion bail-out of Ireland."
"The Irish are the authors of their own misfortune: their government mismanaged their economy and fuelled a house-building boom unrelated to reality."
"But worst of all, they joined the European single currency."
"The first step in solving their problems is to leave the euro; instead, Ireland has chosen to subject itself to financial governance from the European Union."
"The longer it takes to leave the euro, the worse the consequences of the exit will be."
"The same applies, of course, to Portugal, Italy, Spain and Greece and, no doubt, others."
"The only sensible thing that the late and unlamented Labour government did was to keep Britain out of the euro."
"A sensible thing that the coalition government can do is to stop throwing good money after bad."
"Madam President, Mr Batten is right."
"The Irish Government horribly mismanaged our country, and it is a sad day for the Irish people that we are mentioned in this Chamber in these particular circumstances."
"But we are in a situation where we need solidarity."
"Perhaps Mr Batten does not understand that word, or that Ireland needs England as much as England needs Ireland and its economy."
"We are all very much interlinked: let us not forget that."
"Can I just ask some questions?"
"Because in these emotional times, we need some cool heads and clear information."
"Where stand the bank stress tests this evening, when the Irish banks appear to be absolutely overstretched and stressed out?"
"Secondly, there is a question for the ECB to answer about what its mandate is."
"I think that was inferred in the opening remarks, because there are interlinked relationships between all banks."
"Those banks from Germany and France and other countries who invested in Irish banks need to look at what they did and why they did it."
"Lastly, there is political instability this evening in Ireland."
"It is regrettable, but it is necessary that we have a general election."
"(FI) Madam President, Robert Schuman, founder of the EU, said that the European Union would develop through a series of crises, and that development may now well be rapid, because there are quite a lot of crises around."
"This poses an enormous challenge to the political system in the European Union and the Member States."
"It has to be said that Ireland's problems are partly due to the fact that the country has a weak government."
"The political establishment now has to be careful that the cure is not worse than the disease."
"For example, the representative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance said here that the corporate income tax rate in Ireland should be raised to the European level, but that might actually be a death blow to Ireland, its growth and employment."
"The idea is to get the money back, in the form of growth and employment for Ireland, and not to punish the country."
"We need to help Ireland, not punish it."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Trichet, we all know that the main task of the European Central Bank is to ensure monetary stability and that you can best achieve this aim by being politically independent."
"We have always supported you in this."
"The crises of the last two years have shown that you have a further task, and that is to ensure the stability of the financial markets and of the financial system."
"This task, too, you have performed very professionally and convincingly."
"However, to do so, you have had to accept being yoked together with the governments concerned."
"In other words, you were not able to act with complete political independence here; instead, you had to work together with the governments."
"I would be interested to know how exactly you would like to arrange this role in the future to ensure firstly, that you are independent, and secondly, that you can continue to perform this task properly without governments exploiting this opportunity to in fact undermine your independence."
"(PT) Madam President, the imbalances and disparities between economies in the euro area are being exacerbated, in spite of all the promises and proposals, and the question that arises is this: do you not think that it is time to review policies?"
"Do you not see that insisting that countries with such weak economies adhere strictly to the irrational criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact is leading to greater disparities, inequalities, unemployment and poverty?"
"Do you not think that it is time to pay attention to social sustainability?"
"One example is the situation in Portugal, where workers are to hold a general strike this week in protest at so-called austerity policies, which mean cuts in wages and investment, and which will trigger an even more severe recession."
"Do you not think that it is time to change policies and give full priority to social sustainability and create solidarity mechanisms, particularly ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, honourable Members, first of all, I wish to thank you for a very responsible debate."
"Mrs Jaakonsaari said that the European Union has always developed through a series of crises."
"That is largely true, and that is also the case this time, in the short term, while we have to be like the fire brigade and put out the fires that now blaze and threaten financial stability in Europe."
"At present, we are working mainly in Ireland to safeguard the stability of the European economy."
"At the same time, we are trying to build a longerterm European architecture that will actually strengthen economic union and reinforce monetary union, which is already sturdy at the moment, by means of robust and genuine economic union, which, in other words, means the implementation of the original objective for economic and monetary union."
"Both are important tasks, and we cannot afford to neglect either."
"Instead, we have to be like the fire brigade the whole time, putting out the forest fires and, at the same time, building a new European architecture for better regulation of the financial markets and for economic union to function more successfully."
"Ireland is in difficulties."
"Mrs Jaakonsaari is well aware that we in Finland have a saying that translates roughly as 'Help a man when he is in trouble, not when he is not': this also applies just as well to women, of course."
"It is now very important that we all keep a cool head and try and support Ireland while it is in difficulties."
"This is not just for Ireland itself but also for European economic stability, so that we do not allow the first green shoots of recovery to be harmed by this situation."
"It is important that we make it possible for the European economy to grow sustainably and for us to be better capable of ensuring employment."
"This is the very issue: sustainable growth in the European economy, and employment."
"I want to thank you for the substance of the debate and indeed, I agree with Mr GauzÃ¨s that yes, we need to explain better why we are doing what we are doing, and we have to reassure our citizens."
"These are tough and confusing times."
"They are prone to nervousness and misinformation, and therefore we all need to do our share in communicating properly on the challenges."
"Here the European Parliament and all of you, as citizens' representatives, have a key role to play."
"It is not about finding someone to blame: it is about strengthening the European construction that has protected European citizens from much worse consequences."
"Any talk of deconstruction of the European project is irresponsible."
"All the Member States would have been in a much more difficult situation without the European Union and its protective shield."
"The euro is, and continues to be, the cornerstone of the European Union; it is not only a technical monetary arrangement, it is indeed the core political project of the European Union."
"Therefore, it is indeed essential that we do our best, do our utmost, to protect and reinforce this European construction."
"I want to conclude by saying that Mrs Goulard made a very important point when she referred to the original objective of those who created the Economic and Monetary Union: to have a very strong political dimension, in fact, a political union."
"President Trichet is better placed to testify on that than me because he was there then, but I would tend to agree, and that is why in our legislative package, which is now in your hands and in the hands of the Council, we want to supplement the strong monetary union by finally creating a genuine and strong economic union."
"To my mind, it is indeed now high time in the EMU to fill the 'E' with life, and that is what the legislative package on reinforcing economic governance in the end is about."
"Member of the Commission. - (in response to Mr De Rossa, who had spoken with the microphone off.)"
"Madam President, as you well know, I am ready to meet with the Irish MEPs to discuss issues related to Ireland, but - no matter how important and difficult the situation in Ireland is at the moment - this debate is about the ECB and Parliament's report on the ECB."
"There have been so many questions during this discussion concerning Ireland that it is simply not possible to respond to all of them."
"As I said, I am ready to meet with the Irish MEPs and I hope I can meet with all of you tomorrow so that we can discuss this more precisely."
"Firstly, let me say that the questions that have been asked are extremely pertinent and cover all the issues that are important today in great depth."
"I will respond simultaneously to the Members of Parliament because a number of your questions converged."
"First of all, I would like to restate: we are responsible for the 'M' of EMU, the monetary union."
"We have a sentiment on the 'E', economic union, but we are responsible for the 'M' and what we have been instructed to do by the people of Europe, by the parliaments that voted the Maastricht Treaty, is to deliver price stability."
"This is our mandate."
"We are independent to deliver price stability to 330 million fellow citizens."
"As I explained a moment ago, we have delivered price stability in line with our definition, which was in the continuity of the best definition in the world, and let me say that our definition of price stability now appears to be the global benchmark."
"We have delivered price stability over the nearly 12 years of the euro and we are credible for the next ten years according to all the information we have."
"So I want that to be very clear, because - as Olli Rehn said - many of the questions I have are questions that deal with the economic union, which is, of course, part of EMU, but we are not responsible ourselves for economic union."
"We have our ideas; we have our recommendations; we have our diagnosis and analysis and I will come back to that of course."
"My second major remark: we are experiencing the worst crisis since World War II at a global level."
"Had we - both the central banks, including the ECB, and governments - not reacted rapidly and boldly, we would have experienced the worst crisis not since World War II, but since World War I, because we would have had a great depression and this fact - that we have avoided the great depression at global level - has called for immense action by governments and parliaments."
"In our own analysis, the taxpayer risk that has been mobilised to help avoid a dramatic depression is approximately the same on both sides of the Atlantic in terms of GDP, approximately 27% of GDP."
"It was not, of course, utilised in terms of spending, it was even less utilised in terms of losses, if I may say, but nevertheless, it is an immense effort that has been made."
"Otherwise we would have had a dramatic crisis."
"Of course, this means that the global finance and the global economy is extremely fragile and we have to find ways at a global level to avoid this fragility."
"But this is not a European crisis."
"It is the repercussion on Europe, on European governance, of a global crisis, and there is exactly the same kind of meditation and reflection on what to do in the US or in Japan, to mention only two other major advanced economies."
"They also have problems of the first magnitude and I would like us not to transform what is a legitimate reflection on how to run major advanced economies better into a criticism of the euro which, as I said, has delivered exactly in line with what was expected."
"Let me also say that when I look at the finance and fiscal position, the fiscal position of the major advanced economies, I can say that Europe as a whole and the EU area in particular is in a better situation - Mr Goebbels said this - than Japan or the US in terms of public financial deficit."
"Perhaps something like around 6%, even a little bit less, as a consolidated fiscal position next year, when it is of the order of magnitude of ten or more in the two other major advanced economies."
"I say that also for us to have an idea of the order of magnitude."
"So what we have is bad behaviour on the part of a number of countries that are creating problems in their own country and are creating financial instability."
"It is not the euro which is at stake; it is financial instability driven by bad behaviour of fiscal policies, of course, with the interaction with markets which is always there, as we are in market economies."
"Again, fundamentally, our diagnosis is that what was abnormal in the functioning of Europe was that we had poor governance, poor governance of the economic union."
"I can say, sadly, that this is not surprising because the Stability and Growth Pact has been criticised wrongly by some since the very beginning."
"And I have to remind you that I was myself reporting in Parliament on our battle because major countries wanted to blow up the pact, or at least to considerably weaken it."
"Sadly, I have to say that this was the major countries inside the euro area and that the small and medium-sized countries were resisting this tendency."
"This was in 2004 and 2005."
"You will remember it was a fierce battle because it went up to the Court of Justice, and the Commission - and I have to pay homage to the Commission - was lucid, more lucid at the time than the Council, and we were fully supporting the Commission."
"So I have to remind all of you of that."
"Now I have had a number of questions on precisely what we are calling for at this stage."
"I have to say that we already said, when the Commission made its proposal, that we thought it was not enough."
"Taking into account what we feel, taking into account what we see, in the functioning of Europe as a whole, the 27 and the 16 (and tomorrow 17), we considered that the first proposal of the Commission was too weak in terms of automaticity and in terms of rigour of the governance, both for the fiscal surveillance and for the competitiveness indicators, the imbalances."
"So, to the extent that the present state of the proposal which is made by the Council is even weakening the Commission proposal, we cannot say anything to you, honourable Members of Parliament, but that we trust that we are up to the demands of the situation; and the demands of the situation are that we need very strong surveillance, very strong governance."
"In 2005, on behalf of the Governing Council, I said that we were not satisfied at all by what was, at the time, the position of the Council, and what was finally accepted."
"So I do not want to go further because we will have a number of occasions to be in contact with Parliament."
"I have, of course, noted what Mrs Goulard said in terms of very hard work of Parliament, together with the Council and the Commission, to work out what will finally be the position of Europe."
"But again, our message is very clear on that."
"Now let me turn for just one minute to the issue of communication."
"We have, of course, to permanently improve our communication."
"We try to do that."
"Let me only say that as regards our own communication, we are giving the clear definition of price stability which permits everybody to judge what we are doing permanently in real time."
"I would also like to say that we were the first big major central bank to introduce press conferences immediately after the Governing Council."
"We were the first to publish an introductory statement which is our diagnosis of the situation."
"So we try to be as accountable in terms of communication as possible."
"The only thing that we do not do is to publish the individual position of the various members of the Governing Council."
"We trust that it is very important that for the institution which is issuing a currency for 16 states that are united in Europe, but are still sovereign states, it is better that it is the Governing Council as a whole which appears to be the pertinent entity in terms of our decision."
"Now there were a number of very important questions."
"Let me only mention the remark that we are responsible for the 'M', but to the extent that the 'E' is in the hands of the governments and of the Commission, we have in this domain, of course, to take into account the 'E', as always, as any independent central bank does: if the fiscal policy is sound and reasonable, the burden on the monetary policy to deliver price stability is light."
"If we have a bad fiscal policy, then we are overburdening the decisions that have to be taken by the central bank."
"I would say it is the same for us in terms of interaction with the governments, but we are fiercely independent and the fact that we have had to embark on a number of non-standard measures, as I have explained, was to allow us to transmit our monetary policy impulses as well as possible in circumstances where markets were not functioning correctly and therefore, the decisions that we were taking on interest rates were not transmitted correctly to the economy as a whole."
"This is the essence of the non-standard measures, to help restore a more normal functioning of the monetary policy transmission channels and we very clearly made the distinction - I repeated that in a recent colloquy we had in which Ben Bernanke participated - between the standard measures that are really what counts in terms of monetary policy stance, and the non-standard measures designed to help the transmission of monetary policy."
"Now let me only say that I also noted the important question ..."
"(FR) With regard to Mr GauzÃ¨s's question on communication, which I believe others have repeated, there is a tendency, in some communication channels, to consider Europe as some sort of scapegoat."
"If things go wrong, it is Europe's fault."
"We know that this is not true, and the European Parliament, of course, knows it better than anyone."
"There is also a tendency to say that if things do not go well, it is the Commission's fault or it is the fault of the European Central Bank or, better still, it is the euro's fault."
"This is the classic scapegoat phenomenon."
"The euro is the currency that has maintained its internal and external stability remarkably well."
"Moreover, I have not yet said that it is more remarkable than anything a central bank has ever done, within the founding countries of the euro, over the last 50 years - I saved that for last, if I may say so."
"I believe that we have here a currency that is, in fact, solid, and solid in historical terms, too."
"Therefore, let us beware of the scapegoat phenomenon."
"I have to say that we all need to work very hard in terms of communication, but I also address that message to the European Central Bank and to the euro system as a whole; in other words, to all the national central banks that belong to the euro area."
"Moreover, I would say that this is also undoubtedly a problem faced by the 27, and hence a problem for the European Union as a whole."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much for your detailed answer, Mr Trichet."
"I think at this point it is necessary to give a more detailed answer than is usually the case in this House."
"Madam President, I, too, would like to express my great thanks to Mr Trichet, Commissioner Rehn and, above all, the Members of this House for such an open and comprehensive debate."
"It has been highly objective, even if, towards the end, our honourable Members from Ireland sometimes let their emotions show through - which is quite understandable."
"In the brief time that I have available, I would like to mention three points."
"The first is the independence of the European Central Bank."
"I believe it was right and vital for the Heads of State or Government - under the general leadership of Helmut Kohl, a revered citizen of Europe and, at that time, the German Chancellor - to have instigated the independence of the ECB."
"The European Central Bank is the guardian of the euro."
"I believe that the euro has been as stable as it has in the recent months of the crisis precisely because, in the final event, we have such an ECB."
"I would therefore ask you, Mr Trichet, to continue to act as independently as possible in the months ahead."
"If people express their opinions to you, by all means listen to them; but in the final event, the president and managing board of the ECB must safeguard this independence."
"Secondly, we need to be more open with the citizens of the European Union."
"This is a important point."
"Above all, we should not always provide them with information in the language of Brussels, for which we have come in for some criticism, but in such a way that it is genuinely understood by those to whom we are sending the message - the people of Europe."
"As far as I am concerned, that is a very important point."
"Finally, Mr Trichet mentioned Basel III."
"This is another thing that I would certainly emphasise."
"We want to implement Basel III promptly."
"However, I only want to implement Basel III promptly if everyone at G20 level implements it simultaneously."
"We cannot have Europe taking the lead once again and being the sole trailblazer, to the great detriment of our international competitiveness."
"I would therefore argue that Europe should actually implement this together with its partners worldwide, or else consider what the alternatives are."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I, too, would like to congratulate Mr Balz for all his efforts in compiling this report."
"The austerity packages proposed for exiting the crisis should not result in measures which could jeopardise economic recovery."
"I believe that a balance needs to be struck between the economic consolidation process and the protection of investments through jobs and sustainable development."
"The lesson provided by the Member States which have entered the euro area unprepared must make us think seriously about setting realistic deadlines over time."
"In the current situation, a delay of one or two years may be acceptable."
"Enlargement must continue, with the prerequisite of meeting the Maastricht criteria."
"In this respect, I believe that adopting the euro should not be seen as a momentary solution, but as being part of a medium-term wide-ranging political strategy."
"in writing. - I welcome and support this report."
"However, we should keep in mind that, once all the talk about fiscal consolidation, regulation and macro-economic governance ends, we must examine what effect this has had on economic activity - which is the bottom line of any discussion."
"The reality is that we need good and effective regulation and better economic governance so that small and medium-sized businesses, which are the main driver of economic growth, develop and grow."
"The sad truth is that these businesses have suffered greatly in the past two years."
"As a result, we have high and rising unemployment."
"The ECB's policy of pumping in billions of euro to help save indebted banks was the right thing to do, but many banks have become over-reliant on the ECB's liquidity."
"So now we have a situation where banks which provided credit too readily in the boom years are refusing to grant credit to small businesses."
"If this continues then we will not have the growth needed to reduce budget deficits and government debt levels."
"Unemployment will rise, and our economic performance will stagnate."
"Let us act wisely if we do not want to fail the people of Europe again."
"Common system of value added tax and duration of obligation to respect a minimum standard rate (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Casa, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax, with regard to the duration of the obligation to respect a minimum standard rate - C7-0173/2010 -."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to draw this Chamber's attention to the fact that an important vote is currently under way within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and therefore I have to excuse many of the Members who are not going to be present here as we are running late and the voting process has only just begun."
"As the President rightly stated, this report I drew up is extremely important as it concerns the VAT system that we are seeking to amend."
"Now, as everyone knows, the negotiations in order to modify the permanent VAT system have been ongoing for quite some time, yet no significant headway has been made."
"The transitory system that has been used since 1993 is continuously being extended, and we all know that this situation is not a sustainable one and that we need to find a more lasting solution."
"The current transitory system is not yielding the desired results when it comes to the internal market."
"This system diminishes businesses' efficiency and also restricts their effectiveness between borders."
"It is also worrying that this system gives rise to complex forms of fraud, such as carousel fraud, which we discussed recently within this very Parliament."
"These bear a seriously negative impact on the Member States' income."
"The solution facing us is not an easy one, and the right solution can be adopted only after an in-depth debate and long consultation periods have taken place."
"We are all aware of the Commission's recent commitment to draw up a Green Paper in the near future in order to stimulate a discussion on this issue."
"The report I am in charge of urges the Commission to ensure that the process is an efficient one and that we do everything in our power to ensure that, firstly, the new system will improve the internal market's effectiveness; secondly, that this new system reduces the burdens on the business sector; and thirdly, that it combats fraud as effectively as possible."
"This report, which, as we know, has already been approved by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, also urges the Commission to ensure that the concrete proposals will be made public by 2013."
"Let me underline this last point: I am not proposing that they should have a system that is adopted and in place by 2013."
"I am saying that the proposals must be made public by 2013."
"What I would like, however, and I believe I am expressing the viewpoint of the Members in this Chamber, is for this new system to be up and running before the end of this legislature, so that the current transitory system need not be re-extended."
"Whilst we will approve the extension of the new system, we expect concrete steps to be taken without delay in reflecting upon these new proposals."
"I would like to thank my colleagues, especially the shadow rapporteurs, for this report, and I augur that more fervent discussions on this topic will take place, which will give way to a speedy solution."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament and, in particular, David Casa, for his constructive and quick report on the Commission's proposal to extend by five years the existing rules on the minimum standard VAT rate."
"This proposal is simple and is not controversial."
"A quick opinion of the European Parliament on the Commission's proposal will allow the Council to adopt the proposal before the end of the year - just in time, before the current rule expires."
"The proposal has indeed already been discussed in the Council working party."
"No obstacle appeared to a speedy approval."
"As stated by David Casa, the Commission's proposal will give businesses the necessary legal certainty and allow further evaluation of the appropriate level of the standard VAT rate at EU level."
"The Commission will indeed launch very soon a broad debate on the future of VAT in order to evaluate and address the numerous shortcomings in the EU VAT system such as its complexity, the high level of administrative burdens for businesses, and fraud."
"Before the end of the year, I will propose to my fellow Commissioners the publication of a Green Paper on the evaluation of the current system and preferable ways forward for the future."
"I am looking forward to reactions as regards such issues as how to achieve a simpler, more robust and modern VAT system and how to reduce collection and compliance costs for businesses, in particular, SMEs, whilst limiting fraud and providing flexibility for Member States."
"On the basis of the results obtained, the Commission will define its future policy in the VAT area in a Communication on the way forward at the end of 2011."
"The amendments tabled clearly demonstrate the Parliament's interest in participating in this discussion on the future VAT strategy."
"I welcome this sign of interest and hope to have a fruitful debate with you on this important issue at a later stage."
"However, I consider that these amendments are outside the scope of the proposal discussed today, which is limited to extending the period during which the minimum standard rate applies."
"Moreover, some of the amendments pre-empt a debate we should have on the basis of the Green Paper."
"This applies, in particular, to the amendment which requests the Commission to come up with a proposal on definitive rules on VAT rates by 2013."
"At this stage, the Commission cannot commit on a date to table a proposal on VAT rates."
"It cannot predict the outcome of the consultation, whose scope will be broader than the VAT rates."
"I hope that this consultation will give a clear idea of the priorities for the future of VAT."
"The Commission's planning for future legislative proposals will therefore depend to a great extent on the outcome of this consultation."
"Mr President, the Commission's proposal focuses on allowing the current system to continue to run until 2015 and an endeavour to restrict tax rate bands to 10%."
"This is very important, because otherwise, competition between Member States might be distorted in certain sectors."
"Central to this parliamentary report is the notion that it will not be long before the Commission initiates a broad programme of consultation to establish a new system of value added tax."
"In my opinion, the amendments that Members have tabled are, contrary to the view of the Commissioner, extremely important, as even at this stage, we want to mark the direction in which we hope that this new VAT system will go."
"In future, we need to be able to lighten the administrative burden associated with VAT and make it as easy as possible for small and mediumsized enterprises, in particular, to produce reports, though at the same time effectively combating VAT fraud."
"The public economy in many European countries at present is in a mess, and one solution proposed is to start to raise VAT rates."
"However, that will not be of any help in countries where it is common to avoid paying VAT."
"Here, I would like to refer to the report by Mr Casa adopted earlier on here."
"It focused, in particular, on ways to combat VAT fraud in connection with goods and services that were prone to this sort of abuse."
"I hope that the Commission will actually start to do something about this in the future."
"Mr President, as indicated in the Council's proposal for a directive, the minimum VAT rate has helped keep the system operating at an acceptable level."
"I believe that we should consider having a common regulatory framework which would include the conclusions reached following the experience of the budgetary imbalances highlighted by the financial crisis."
"A new European VAT strategy is required, focused on reducing red tape and the fiscal obstacles which hamper businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We must also consider the need to prevent and combat fraud."
"However, until this strategy has been finalised, I believe that the decision to extend the transitional provision on the minimum VAT rate until 31 December 2015 is intended to reassure the business community, prevent structural imbalances in the European Union and encourage harmonisation of fiscal legislation."
"Pending the Commission Green Paper on the review of the VAT system, I would like to highlight the tendency of some governments facing recession to increase the VAT rate to 24-25%, as has happened in Romania and Hungary."
"The relative commitment to keep the maximum VAT rate within a 10% range above the 15% limit has been observed up to now."
"However, I believe that we need an absolute ban in this respect to prevent any breaches of the 25% threshold."
"Let us not forget that beyond these statistics, we are dealing with ordinary citizens whose standard of living is being increasingly affected by austerity policies and excessive taxation."
"I would like to end by saying that overtaxation is not a remedy for an ailing economy."
"It only serves to prolong the agony."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur very much."
"As a matter of principle, I believe that we should avoid controlling consumption by means of VAT rates."
"However, as long as exceptions and reduced VAT rates do not obviously interfere with the free market, we have hitherto chosen to accept differences between EU Member States."
"However, as you well know, Professor Monti states in his report on the single market that current differences can also adversely affect the single market."
"It is therefore important for us to call for a definitive system of VAT rates and to clearly point out that a review of the VAT Directive should use the single market strategy as a guideline rather than the separate interests of the individual countries."
"It is also important, as the Commissioner says, for us to focus on reducing the administrative burdens, removing tax barriers and improving the business environment, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, while at the same time ensuring that we create a system that stands firm against fraud."
"Taxes are, of course, a very national matter and one in which the nations' self-determination is important."
"At the same time, it is important to remember that a well-functioning internal market probably requires more and closer cooperation, including with regard to matters of taxation, than we have today."
"I therefore hope that the Commission - and the Commissioner - will have the courage to tackle these issues in its forthcoming proposals and that these proposals will actually take as their starting point a well-functioning internal market, despite national opposition."
"Difficult questions in difficult times require detailed analysis."
"(SK) Mr President, in the submitted proposal, the Commission proposes applying a minimum standard VAT rate of 15% for a further 5 years up to 2015."
"Even though I understand the Commission's argument that it wants, through this directive, to provide companies with legal certainty, I think that the VAT analysis requires some very intensive work."
"The reason for this, in my opinion, is that many companies and many cases of tax losses in cross-border trade show that the VAT system in Europe is very badly organised."
"It is not just a problem of the actual rate; it is a problem of the rules applied on the national market and in international trade, which allow these scams to operate quite legitimately in many cases."
"I would therefore like to use my speech to make a call for the review of the entire VAT system, which I think would be in the interests both of our economies and of our businesses."
"I consider a deadline of 2013 to be quite realistic, and we should simply move forward on this problem not by sorting out the rates, but by sorting out the rules."
"Mr President, taxes are, at best, a necessary evil, and should always reflect spending needs."
"A tax rate that is set before spending needs are decided is a recipe for taking people's money and then deciding what to spend it on."
"It is a recipe for profligacy."
"Harmonisation of VAT rates to a common standard and a common reduced rate, which was the proposal of the Commission back in 1993, would take yet more power out of the hands of Member States."
"The levying of taxation is one of the defining characteristics of a sovereign state."
"It will be yet another step towards the sovereign state being the European Union, and Member States simply being powerless appendices to it."
"Combating fraud and easing burdens on SMEs are red herrings."
"VAT harmonisation is about centralisation and the consolidation of EU power."
"(RO) Mr President, the aim of the new VAT strategy must be to reduce administrative burdens, remove fiscal obstacles and improve the business climate, especially for SMEs."
"There is a noticeable degree of imbalance in relation to the development of the internal market."
"For this reason, European businesses have been put at a disadvantage."
"In addition, the VAT system, as currently designed and implemented by Member States, has weaknesses that fraudsters use to their advantage."
"I would like to call on the Commission to present the results of its analyses."
"It will also have to arrange consultations on the new VAT strategy with all stakeholders."
"In this respect, common aspects will have to be dealt with, such as reduced VAT rates, exemptions from the scheme, the option to set a maximum rate and, last but not least, the place of taxation of intra-EU supplies."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I want to thank you for the comments and the views expressed during this debate."
"I am glad to see that the European Parliament and the Commission share views on the need to rethink the current VAT system."
"As I indicated in my opening remarks, I welcome the spirit of the amendments relating to the future of VAT."
"Nevertheless, the Commission considers that this technical proposal only concerns the periodical extension of the minimum level of the standard VAT rate."
"The outcome of the consultations on a new VAT strategy is only mentioned in order to justify the reason why it is premature to set a permanent standard rate level."
"There is therefore no need to refer to the aims and the framework of the new VAT strategy in this context at this stage."
"I also repeat that the Commission cannot commit today on a date for the future legislative proposal on rates."
"We will first need to have the debate on the future of VAT, which will give a clear idea on the priorities for the Commission."
"The outcome of this consultation will steer the Commission's planning for the future legislative proposal."
"We are finalising our work on the Green Paper and, in the coming weeks, we will produce the real questions for debate for everyone involved: the general public, Members of the European Parliament, stakeholders and the Member States."
"The questions which will be raised clearly address issues which were raised during today's debate."
"I am looking forward to fruitful debates in the coming months in order to enable the Commission to develop a much better strategy for VAT in the future."
"Mr President, yes, I am indeed glad that the Commissioner has understood that we are calling for the drawing up of a Green Paper without delay in order to fuel a more in-depth debate on the Commission's proposals."
"As my fellow Members in this Chamber have mentioned, we must quickly rid the system of all types of fraud and help the business sector as much as we can to eliminate the barriers that the current system creates."
"We also want to see a more effective internal market."
"Today, we did not discuss what solutions are required."
"What we are asking of the Commission is to come up with proposals without delay so as to help instigate proper discussions on the new system, thus enabling us to improve upon what we currently have as soon as possible."
"I understand that the aim of this report is, in actual fact, to extend the time period."
"However, I would like to draw the Commission's attention to the fact that we are eager for it to present us with proposals as promptly as possible, as this will allow us to share our own ideas in turn, and ultimately guarantee a fairer system for everyone."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:30."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"For most EU Member States and third countries with internationally interlinked markets, VAT (or sales tax) is one of the main sources of financing for the state."
"Sales tax is therefore at least as important as direct taxes."
"Maintaining a minimum standard rate of 15% for the next 5 years will aid competition in the internal market and will provide legal certainty for companies."
"With regard to the reduced VAT rates in the EU, in the case of reduced VAT rates on certain services, such as repairs, hairdressing or beauty treatment businesses, the Commission must also take care to avoid distortions of competition."
"Such forms of tax relief have a negative effect on Austrian small businesses, for example, which may not be able to stand up to competition from Slovakian or Hungarian service providers."
"The solution to this is as follows: YES to the targeted subsidising of SMEs, including by means of sales tax, BUT while avoiding distortions of competition between the Member States."
"Urgent aid to Haiti (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on urgent aid to Haiti."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission is deeply concerned by the deterioration of the cholera situation in Haiti."
"The number of casualties among the hospitalised cases is increasing sharply day by day."
"The number of people admitted to hospitals comes to more than 20 000."
"At the end of last week, more than 1 100 people had already lost their lives."
"But it is feared that these figures are severely underestimated."
"The fatality rate is very high and shows that people arrive too late at health centres."
"Cholera treatment is simple, but early access to treatment is key to limiting fatalities."
"Treating cholera patients also requires considerable human resources."
"The Haitian public health system is now seriously overstretched, despite substantial support from the international community."
"MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃ¨res, as one of the front-line medical actors, is calling on all groups and agencies present in Haiti to step up the size and speed of their efforts."
"The whole country is now affected."
"The epidemic is spreading at an alarming rate in the capital, Port-au-Prince."
"Slums such as CitÃ© Soleil are especially prone to contagion due to very bad hygiene conditions and poor access to clean water."
"We are focusing on saving lives through prompt treatment of those affected, increasing access to clean water, promoting better hygiene behaviour and supporting epidemiological surveillance in order to know where and how the epidemic is evolving."
"The Commission has reinforced its humanitarian presence with relevant medical expertise and mobilised funds - EUR 12 million - to support partners in Haiti."
"The European mechanism for civil protection has also been activated through the Monitoring and Information centre of the European Commission and has already cofinanced the transport of in-kind assistance provided by France."
"Another offer from Austria has just entered the pipeline."
"An EU civil protection and technical support team with Member States' experts is to be deployed early this week."
"Experts from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have been deployed by DG SANCO to assess the best way to reinforce epidemiological surveillance in Haiti, and further cooperation is under consideration."
"After the recent incidents related to civil unrest in Cap Haitien and Port-au-Prince, we are following closely the security situation with our partners and the relevant UN agencies, particularly ahead of the presidential elections of 28 November."
"The Commission was in touch with the UN Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordination, Baroness Amos."
"We fully support her in stressing the importance of allowing national and international aid workers to continue lifesaving activities without disruption."
"Considering the serious and rapid deterioration of the cholera situation, further contributions are urgently required to fill gaps in health, water, sanitation, hygiene and logistics."
"Priorities include medical personnel and other personnel specialised in water, sanitation and hygiene, as well as medical supplies, beds, water purification units and tablets."
"The Commission is therefore in contact with the Belgian Presidency and the Member States to encourage further EU support to help Haiti at this very critical and difficult time."
"EU support can be channelled through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism."
"The endless efforts of Haitian and international aid workers to meet the current challenges on the ground are commendable, but it is clear that the sheer scale of the crisis requires even more assets and resources."
"We are therefore now working hard on stepping up our emergency response together with our partners, but difficult times are certainly ahead, due to the rapidly evolving situation."
"The continued solidarity of the international community with the Haitian people remains absolutely essential."
"This is why I call upon you all to do your utmost to scale up the support of the Member States in order to avoid a major humanitarian disaster."
"Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, the cholera epidemic has already claimed more than 1 200 lives, and more than 52 000 people are infected."
"Thus, in spite of the strong presence of international organisations in Haiti, the situation is deteriorating daily, and the epidemic could infect some 400 000 people in the next few months."
"I am, of course, delighted at the EUR 12 million released by the European Commission, and I support Mrs Georgieva's appeal to the Member States to provide aid in kind so that water can be purified, and to supply equipment."
"Providing drinking water and toilet facilities is the only way to reduce the number of people infected."
"One of the priority actions is to reassure the population frightened by this disease, which is unknown in the country."
"Communicating with the populations is essential in order to provide information about the disease and to avert it, but also to prevent internal violence from spreading, especially since the country is in the middle of elections."
"This new crisis has once again highlighted the inability of the Haitian authorities and of the health system to cope with this crisis."
"The country has suffered numerous disasters for years."
"The earthquake in Haiti demonstrated the almost total incompetence of the local authorities."
"Following the earthquake, there was genuine political will to reconstruct Haiti differently, and there were many promises of donations."
"Almost a year later, reconstruction has hardly begun, and those involved in development are pessimistic."
"The European Commission must act as a driver in the reconstruction process so that Haiti finally emerges from this chaos."
"Mr President, I welcome once again the swiftness of the European Union's humanitarian intervention."
"However, at the same time, I believe that our efforts in this country must focus on building a minimum operational state structure at a time when the state of Haiti is just a sham."
"It is failing to fulfil its basic duties such as organising refugee camps, maintaining order and providing hygienic conditions and drinking water."
"This vulnerability has facilitated the rapid spread of disease and the death of more than 1 200 people."
"Haiti needs a state which can do something for its poor."
"Three out of four Haitians are surviving on less than USD 2 a day."
"More than 1.5 million citizens are living in refugee camps, posing a serious source of risk to public health and safety."
"I believe that the Haitian state's weakness is now the main risk factor."
"Its lack of authority means that the population's discontent is being targeted at UN forces."
"Indeed, NGOs risk no longer being able to accomplish their mission."
"This is why the elections on 28 November are vital and must not be postponed, despite calls from some quarters."
"Mr President, of course there are co-factors that have undoubtedly encouraged the spread of cholera in Haiti."
"This is certainly not an answer, but it is an explanation."
"The answer to this scourge must be twofold."
"For the moment, the aid workers on the ground have confirmed to us that soap, substances to make the water fit to drink, and proper hygiene education are needed."
"Preparations are being made in the present situation for the long term as well."
"In a country in which everything is still to be done or redone, reconstruction is necessary after the earthquake, and priority must be given to building infrastructure that is designed to improve both individual and collective hygiene."
"I hope that, eight months after the New York conference on the reconstruction of Haiti, it will no longer be possible to cite a lack of funds as an excuse for the little progress recorded to date, given that all the speakers agreed that the humanitarian phase must continue for many months yet."
"It will also be necessary to name those responsible for the slow progress without too much beating about the bush."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, we see in Haiti one of the hugest humanitarian aid operations ever."
"We have to make sure that we do not lose the battle against this catastrophe and that we manage to get results and help Haitians to build their future."
"Apart from being an individual disaster for millions of people, a failure would also be a backlash for the international community's effort and capacity to conduct a joint effort in humanitarian aid."
"I believe that we have to put all our experience, all the lessons we have learnt in Haiti and elsewhere, and also enough money, into the pot."
"Therefore, I very much welcome the Commission's announcement that it will put an additional EUR 12 million into the fight against cholera."
"We have to make sure that this support reaches Haiti immediately, that it arrives in full and not just in part, and that we support the right initiatives in order to make it effective."
"We also have to make sure that we do not neglect the efforts for the earthquake reconstruction because, without that, fighting disease will be impossible."
"I have two questions to the Commission."
"Firstly, I would like to know whether the pledged money has arrived - the money that was promised - and whether it was disbursed and absorbed."
"Secondly, I would like to know what you think about postponing the elections, because that is again on the agenda."
"The Haitian revolution has never managed to enter the history books."
"Let us hope that the difficult time in Haiti at the moment will enter the history books as the starting point for preparing a better future for all Haitians."
"I hope it can also be mentioned that the EU played a very positive role in this."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, two months ago, I co-chaired the delegation under the ACP to Haiti and this was probably one of the greatest and most moving experiences of my life."
"First, there are tremendously dedicated people there doing the work to try to help the Haitians, and second, the Haitian people are a very proud people and we should recognise that at the beginning of this debate."
"But we were told by the President and the Prime Minister how lucky the Haitians were that they had good sanitation and that they had no disease - and the sad thing now is that disease has hit them."
"This is not a terribly hard disease to cure."
"But you have got to be there to see the conditions under which the aid workers are working and when you talk about a health service, I am sorry, Mr President, Haiti does not have a health service like the rest of us and you know it: they are dependent on MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res, the British Red Cross and many other organisations from all around the world."
"As far as the election is concerned, it is true that Haiti does not need an election at this moment."
"But until they get a President and a Prime Minister who can lead them, they will have no chance of moving forward."
"I want to commend - because when I was there I saw it for myself - the brilliant men and women of the European Commission Office, under terrible circumstances, trying to keep a European presence in Port-au-Prince, and they have done a fantastic job."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to thank all my fellow Members, and especially the Conference of Presidents, for having agreed to this debate on Haiti, proposed by my group."
"It was an emergency."
"Last January, after the earthquake, the international community rallied round strongly in support of Haiti."
"However, it seems that there was a gap, not to say a gulf, between the promises made and the aid that in fact arrived on the ground."
"Last March, Baroness Ashton made a commitment, on behalf of the European Union, to provide aid worth EUR 1.235 billion to help the people of Haiti to build a better future."
"Since last July, the NGOs and, in particular, MSF, Commissioner, have been sounding the alarm and reporting the pathogenic living conditions endured by hundreds of thousands of people."
"The situation has scarcely changed since then, yet people are amazed that the cholera epidemic is spreading very fast, and the international community is again beginning to feel pity."
"There have already been more than a thousand deaths, and the number of people affected is increasing all the time, even though specialists say that the measures to prevent the disease from proving fatal are relatively simple to take."
"However, health workers have little training in this disease, and there are problems in getting basic healthcare products to where they are needed."
"Under such circumstances, how can one fail to understand why riots have taken place?"
"The Haitian population feels quite helpless."
"It is difficult for it to go on having confidence in the international community."
"My questions will therefore be simple, Commissioner:"
"Where exactly is all the aid that the European Union promised to Haiti, and not just the humanitarian aid?"
"If it had arrived sooner, do you not think that this further tragedy could have been avoided?"
"How is it that, once again, international conferences seem to have resulted only in unkept promises?"
"Why are President PrÃ©val's efforts to turn MINUSTAH into support for reconstruction not meeting with any response?"
"Finally, the Haitian population wants the elections to take place, but under what conditions will they take place and what sort of support will the European Union provide?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite all the warnings which were made against neglecting the future of Haiti following the earthquake in January, the news in recent days seems to show that the island has been abandoned by the international community at the most critical moment, that of reconstruction."
"Indeed, cholera, something which few people in Haiti know about and which is ultimately given a mystic, religious significance, is now spreading."
"The United Nations peacekeepers have been accused of spreading this contagion."
"It took just one Nepalese soldier on the island to become infected for hundreds of people, women and children, to besiege the general headquarters of the peace force."
"Humanitarian workers have also felt threatened and many are leaving the country."
"The tension is extremely high, and much of the rubble caused by the very violent earthquake of 12 January remains on the streets and in the town squares."
"We have heard that there is not enough water and that it is therefore impossible for people to wash and to protect themselves against infection."
"The vibrio is spreading rapidly, and the number of dead is rising exponentially."
"The figures have already been given, but I want to repeat them: to date, there have been 1 130 victims, and the number of hospital admissions has risen to more than 18 000 in one month."
"However, there are thousands of others who report symptoms of infection every day."
"The international community cannot delay any longer."
"A solution must be found immediately, otherwise any further infection will remain forever on our conscience."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Commissioner Georgieva on the effective coordination work that she has undertaken and indeed the discussions that she is having with Baroness Amos at the UN."
"The easiest and cheapest thing for this House to do now is to criticise."
"I would like us to be positive and place the pressure where it needs to be."
"I say this to all Members of this House."
"We need to put pressure on our own Member States to bring forward more aid, and more aid in kind."
"If you look at the list of countries, these are countries - such as Spain, Ireland, Italy, France, Austria, Hungary - currently facing grave economic situations, yet they have dug deep."
"Therefore, I urge each and every one of us to contact our own governments and ask them to commit."
"If there are questions as to whether aid is getting through or not, let us build the capacity to get the aid through."
"Finally, I should like to thank the Commissioner and congratulate her on the commitment of the extra EUR 12 million."
"The great tragedy is the earthquake."
"The even greater tragedy now is this cholera epidemic."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first the epicentre of a terrible earthquake, in precisely the poorest and worst-governed area in the American hemisphere, and now cholera in the country which receives one of the highest amounts of per capita international aid."
"What a contradiction!"
"It is not just a terrible combination of bad luck: in Haiti, in the streets crowded with children and tents crammed in amongst the rubbish, no one knows where to begin."
"The local political class is often greedy and focused on power games rather than taking control of the reconstruction efforts, and the bureaucratic machine, decimated by the earthquake, has a weak administrative culture and, in some cases, has even obstructed the distribution of aid."
"There are many, often badly run, international organisations and, in fact, they have failed to protect the population."
"Visiting the country with the European Parliament delegation in June, the concentration of abandoned fields, rubble which had not been removed and rubbish already gave a clear indication of how bad the situation could become."
"Now cholera is here."
"The Commission and the Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO) have so far done what was required, but they must now redouble their efforts."
"My feeling is that now, as well as strong recovery action, Haiti needs greater protection at the international political level."
"Mr President, this is a tragedy that does not bear talking about."
"When the disaster struck in January last year, the international community descended on Haiti with great fanfare."
"Military helicopters came to lift heavy pieces of masonry that had fallen down."
"They have all gone."
"They suddenly left."
"Those pieces of masonry are blocking roads and there is no access, and the road network has broken down."
"Commissioner Georgieva has been trying hard to coordinate the activities."
"Why did this happen?"
"Why did all those people - including Secretary of State Clinton, who suddenly turned up there in January - suddenly disappear?"
"Why is the United Nations now being asked to disappear?"
"When are they going to ask the EU to disappear?"
"This is ridiculous."
"We need the international community back there at the level at which it was working, and should let ordinary Haitians be depoliticised from this nonsense going on in the capital."
"(SK) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the report you have presented to us on the current situation in Haiti."
"The outbreak of another epidemic in Haiti was to be expected."
"Since the start of the year, and since the earthquake, we have been working hard, but the work has not advanced as quickly as we hoped."
"We have spoken often about the situation prevailing in Haiti before the earthquake."
"It would certainly have helped us if Haiti had been a functioning state, but it is not, and nor will it be for a long time yet."
"There is much ground to be covered."
"There is now a need for urgent action, as we are risking further epidemics and further violence."
"Commissioner, there is a real need to bring the best health experts together in Brussels, and to draw up a strategic aid plan for Haiti."
"The situation must be resolved in the areas of security, finance and especially health."
"(EL) Commissioner, I, too, should like to start by congratulating you on your outstanding work in the case of Haiti and for everything you have done in Pakistan."
"We know that you will be present at every emergency."
"This truly was a monumental disaster."
"We are talking about over 1 000 dead and 15 000 sick and the numbers keep rising."
"The needs are immense and we can see that the money at your disposal is not enough."
"It is becoming increasingly clear that we really do need new financing instruments; perhaps - and obviously first of all - a transaction tax."
"We need other financing mechanisms that can support our efforts to cope with increasing humanitarian needs."
"We should also consider what we can do to prevent the transmission of diseases from people working for the UN from happening again."
"(NL) Mr President, this afternoon, I received the latest information from a Dutch aid agency which has had a presence in Haiti for many years, and that information actually confirms the sombre, but realistic, picture that the Commission has described."
"At the same time, the Dutch aid agency have told me that they have put their trust in Europe, in particular, as a major donor."
"What is it then that they are relying on us to do?"
"Well, although a huge amount was pledged at the international donor conference, only a fraction of it has been received."
"Now the United Nations has requested additional funding, but a large part of the money that has been pledged has not yet been received."
"I hope, therefore, that the European Union will take the lead in ensuring that the money really comes through because the situation in Haiti is distressing."
"Of course, prevention and clean drinking water are the priorities."
"I hope that the European Union will take the initiative to ensure good water supplies for Haiti."
"Experts, the digging of water wells, clean drinking water and also medical care are particularly important."
"All of these are in short supply."
"I appeal to the Netherlands, but also to the European institutions, to ensure that they actually come to Haiti's aid immediately in this acute emergency."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner Damanaki, first of all, I should like to congratulate the Commission for the efforts carried out in Haiti."
"However, the situation requires an urgent and much stronger response."
"We need more resources and a greater international commitment, despite the difficulties involved in mobilising funds in the current economic context."
"It cannot be that funds are available for some problems but not for this humanitarian situation."
"We have a number of health and humanitarian priorities: to inform the population about a specific disease, obtain tents, improve sanitation in all areas and provide access to clean water."
"All these tasks are urgent and we need a great effort on the part of the Commission and all the Member States."
"(FI) Mr President, I wish to thank Commissioner Georgieva for the work that the Commission has done."
"It is very important that the European Union has a very strong and visible role to play in Haiti."
"However, this is about our fellow human beings, our fellow creatures."
"We also have a responsibility for them, as they have been the victims of an unparalleled catastrophe: first an earthquake and now a cholera epidemic."
"It is important that when we send money and aid there, it gets to its destination quickly."
"Many Christian aid organisations have been doing a good job there, and it appears that they also have effective channels for delivering aid promptly to those in need of it."
"In this respect, I hope that the Commission can also make use of the recognised humanitarian and Christian organisations that are doing such good work there."
"This way, it will be possible to get the aid to its destination and achieve the best possible result."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you all for your engagement and discussion on a topic that is, unfortunately, going to be with us for quite some time to come."
"This is not an easy crisis to resolve."
"We have had some estimates about the scale of the problem over the coming months - including from our own experts - and I agree very much with those who said we need to deploy expertise from the European Centre for Disaster Control in Haiti."
"The estimates are that somewhere between half a million and 720 000 people will be infected before this wave of epidemics is over."
"The Pan American Health Organisation estimate of 400 000 is a little lower but of the same order of magnitude."
"So we will have to mobilise."
"I agree with each and every one of you who spoke about immediate mobilisation and the need to help right now."
"Let me make four points."
"The first is how we can best help."
"This is a time when we have to deploy true partner organisations and immediately give them the resources to act."
"We also have to call on the Member States to provide in-kind assistance."
"Since Thursday, when I addressed the Member States, we have been seeing support coming through, but more is needed in terms of healthcare professionals, water purification tablets and support for an awareness campaign, because - as many here have said - there is widespread misunderstanding of what this disease is and how it can best be treated."
"As a result, people die unnecessarily because they are scared to go to treatment centres: they are afraid of catching the disease there rather than being treated for it."
"Secondly, a number of speakers have talked about the pledged money and what is happening with reconstruction in Haiti."
"The pledge made by the Commission has been honoured."
"The Commission committed EUR 460 million and is delivering according to the timetable which it announced, and the High Representative and Vice-President, Cathy Ashton, and Commissioner Piebalgs are about to take stock with Member States on where we stand with the money we have promised to provide."
"I can assure you that this is going to be taken very seriously, because the reputation of the international community is at stake at a very difficult time."
"However - and this is my third point, which is a very important one - there is a limit to the absorptive capacity in Haiti, which I believe I talked about with some of you."
"When I first arrived in Haiti, I thought that, terrible as this disaster was, it was not Haiti's worst problem."
"Haiti's biggest problem was the many decades of lack of development and the absence of a functional state which, among other things, also means the absence of a functional health service."
"I saw people in camps queuing in front of a doctor, not because they were sick, but because they had never seen a doctor in their lives and were taking advantage of a health service being offered in the camps."
"This total lack of the skills and capabilities of a functional state creates problems that are making this epidemic worse."
"We are still struggling to get the government to authorise space for the disposal of dead bodies - without which the epidemics can, of course, spread further - and to dislodge latrines so that sanitation can improve."
"So I cannot stress strongly enough how critical it is for us to understand that Haiti's problems are not easy to resolve, because at the heart of this problem is these decades of lack of development and the absence of a functional state."
"A question was asked about the elections and whether they should still be held."
"The Haitian authorities prefer to stick to the timetable."
"It is difficult for me to give an answer."
"I have not yet been to Haiti, but my feeling is that cancelling or postponing the elections might actually destabilise a very difficult situation."
"There may be something to be gained by holding the elections but, as I have said, this is based on what I have heard, not on what I have seen."
"My fourth point concerns engagement."
"You called for the Commission to be very directly engaged: we are, and will continue to be so."
"Baroness Ashton will very probably be in Haiti tomorrow, and I am planning to go myself because at this point, mobilisation, good coordination and, frankly, also giving hope to people there, and to our own staff, are important."
"Our own people are struggling with a very difficult situation: they are in places where the Haitian health officials become scared by the epidemic and just leave, and they then have to handle a massive increase in cases."
"What we need to do now is to make sure that we retain a calm presence and try to steer the course for people which gives them the most hope."
"One Member spoke about the Haitian people being very resilient."
"They are, and they deserve all our help at this very difficult time."
"The debate is closed."
"Long-term plan for the anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay and the fisheries exploiting that stock - Multiannual plan for the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel and the fisheries exploiting that stock - Prohibition of highgrading and restrictions on fishing for flounder and turbot in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound - Use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture (debate)"
"Î¤he next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"the report by Izaskun Bilbao Barandica, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a long-term plan for the anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay and the fisheries exploiting that stock - C7-0157/2009 -,"
"the report by Pat the Cope Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a multiannual plan for the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel and the fisheries exploiting that stock - C7-0010/2009 -,"
"the report by Marek JÃ³zef GrÃ³barczyk, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 as regards the prohibition of highgrading and restrictions on fishing for flounder and turbot in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound - C7-0156/2010 -, and"
"the report by JoÃ£o Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 708/2007 concerning the use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture -."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I would firstly like to acknowledge, thank and congratulate the inshore fishing sector of the Bay of Biscay for its responsible behaviour."
"Commissioner, the sector urgently needs this plan if it is to achieve its objective, namely, to carry on a profitable activity without jeopardising the future of the fishing ground."
"This requires maintaining anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay at a level that allows for sustainable exploitation in economic, environmental and social terms."
"This can be done much more effectively by calculating yields on the basis of scientific reports rather than allowing total allowable catch (TAC) calculations to become subject to obscure political negotiations."
"The rules of exploitation must therefore be addressed in the plan, and this means that fishing quotas must be established on the basis of stock estimations obtained from scientific reports."
"Commissioner, this initiative was tabled by the Commission in July 2009."
"We started working in September."
"We established a work procedure together with the entire Spanish and French sectors represented by fishermen's organisations, scientific institutes and the South Western Waters Regional Advisory Council."
"Following this method, we worked on a joint proposal that received broad support in Parliament."
"Having achieved a high level of consensus and being conscious of the impending entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the uncertainty surrounding how it should be applied to cases that were already open, on 30 November, we held an indicative vote in the Committee on Fisheries."
"This open and inclusive approach has run up against a very different attitude on the part of the Council and the Commission."
"For a start, we learnt in the course of our work that a control regulation was being prepared which would affect this report, although we only received limited information on this matter."
"This plunged us into uncertainty in a way that could quite easily have been avoided."
"Following the vote in the Committee on Fisheries and during the Spanish Presidency, I negotiated the initiative with the Council."
"We decided to call a trialogue meeting but, to our surprise, on the same day of the meeting, the Spanish Presidency unexpectedly announced to us that, at the request of the French Government, the Spanish Government had decided to postpone the issue as it was unsure about its legal basis."
"After months of work, we had stalemate."
"The Spanish Presidency had no agreement and no possibility of a trialogue."
"I asked the new Presidency whether it was willing to continue negotiations."
"They told me not to be impatient, not to hurry."
"In view of the Council's utter unwillingness to move forward, we took a new vote, following advice from legal services."
"In this second vote, three amendments were rejected which had been adopted in the indicative vote and which were of crucial importance to the sector."
"The first one relates to exploitation rates and proposes 0.4 as a more appropriate rate."
"The second amendment refers to the inclusion of live bait in the TAC."
"It would be a mistake to count it as part of the caught quota."
"Finally, the third amendment refers to the review of catches."
"If the Scientific Committee is unable to produce an estimate of the current biomass because it lacks sufficient information, the sector must not be doubly penalised with a 25% reduction of the TAC on the previous year."
"The Commission had already considered it more appropriate in this case to reduce the TAC by 10%, in no event less than 7 000 tonnes."
"As regards the powers of this institution, they have been consistently disregarded by the Council and the Commission."
"The fact that even as we are debating this initiative, we have heard unofficial news that the Council has requested its withdrawal, gives a clear indication of its attitude."
"Is this true?"
"I am asking you now, Commissioner."
"Why?"
"What do you intend to do?"
"I would like an answer today."
"I would also like the Belgian Presidency to tell me why it has requested the withdrawal of the initiative."
"I would like some clear answers on these issues."
"We have been working for 14 months and all we have is confusion."
"The actions of the Council and the Commission are damaging the credibility of the European institutions in the eyes of a sector that is tired of this way of doing things and needs solutions."
"Strengthen your credibility in this sector!"
"Or at least win back the credibility you have lost since September 2009!"
"Parliament is determined to exercise the codecision powers conferred on it by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"You must respect them."
"Your actions do not match up to 21st century leadership."
"Our guiding principles have been transparency and participation."
"Please adopt these principles."
"This is how the European project must move forward."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I wish to sincerely thank all those who helped me during the preparation of this important report on Atlantic Horse Mackerel: the shadow rapporteurs, the secretariat of the Committee on Fisheries, the Pelagic RAC, the group policy adviser and the adviser from my own office."
"I would also like to thank the Commission and the Council for their help and support."
"The collaboration and discussion, and the input of ideas from all these people, ensured that I was able to place this report - which I would hope would be generally accepted - before you today."
"The western stock of horse mackerel is one of the most important stocks for the fisheries sector in Europe."
"The proposal is based on the implementation plan agreed by the European Commission and the UN world summit on sustainable development in 2002."
"At this summit, the Commission agreed to maintain or to restore fish stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield."
"The subsequent proposal by the European Commission was drafted in close cooperation with the pelagic Resource Assessment Group (RAG), which had originally put forward this proposal."
"Egg surveys for horse mackerel have been conducted every three years since 1997."
"The data collected was insufficient to allow the scientists to make a full assessment as to the health of the stock."
"The proposed management plan addresses these difficulties by establishing a formula for vessels in the horse mackerel fishery, known as the harvest control rule."
"This rule provides for a mechanism for calculating an annual ceiling of maximum allowable landings of horse mackerel harvested from the defined area."
"The plan was expected to come into operation in late 2009 but was delayed due to the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Of course, I fully respect the rights of the Council to set and to allocate fishing opportunities."
"I met with representatives from the Belgian Presidency prior to the adoption of my report in the Fisheries Committee."
"They suggested a proposal which would provide the Council with a degree of flexibility in terms of the total removable amount when setting the total allowable catch."
"I believe that this proposal by the Belgian Presidency, which was subsequently adopted by the Fisheries Committee, protects the Council's exclusive right under the treaties to set and to allocate fishing opportunities."
"I would like to discuss the amendments proposed by the PPE, the S&D and the GUE/NGL political groups in relation to Area 8C - in other words, the Bay of Biscay."
"I would like to inform the House that, as rapporteur, I support the amendment tabled by the socialists but cannot accept the PPE and the GUE/NGL amendments."
"I will give my reasons for that."
"The scientific advice is clear."
"This is one stock which covers the entire geographical area."
"Should Parliament adopt the PPE and GUE/NGL proposal, it would make a nonsense of the management plan to introduce two separate tagged areas for one stock."
"If we did this, it would establish a very dangerous and a very serious precedent for future mackerel management plans."
"We could not agree to the splitting of a single fisheries stock."
"Those who wish to support this will be doing so for their own personal reasons and for the reasons of their Member States, but this is a common fisheries policy and we must adhere to this."
"I appreciate that our Spanish and Portuguese colleagues may have concerns, and I have included those concerns in Amendment 7 in the draft report."
"It states that this plan shall be implemented taking account of artisanal fisheries and historic rights."
"In conclusion, this amendment is acceptable to the Council and the pelagic RAG and takes into consideration the views expressed by the Spanish and Portuguese colleagues."
"But let us keep the policy as it is."
"Mr President, I would like to start my speech by expressing my very sincere thanks to everyone who helped in the preparation of this report: the European Commission, all the shadow rapporteurs and the members of the Committee on Fisheries, for their support in drawing up this report."
"We achieved complete agreement, as the report was adopted unanimously by the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries."
"Once again, I would like to express my very sincere thanks."
"The report, which aims to regulate fishing of flatfish in the Baltic Sea and to stop the practice of discarding while maintaining the model of fisheries management known as total allowable catch (TAC), indicates that this system is functioning properly and has a practical application for certain species of fish."
"This is why the significance of the introduction of Article 15a into Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 should be highlighted."
"The species of fish caught may have a low market value or may not be fit for human consumption."
"It should also be stressed that this provision allows for the removal from deck of live flounder which have been caught and which have no market value during the period when protective restrictions are in force."
"This is why this article will allow the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources."
"The action plan adopted on the basis of my report must eliminate discards in the Baltic Sea, for example, by the introduction, where appropriate, of a complete ban on discards in the Baltic Sea fishery."
"This must result in sustainable and more efficient management of marine resources."
"Bringing in a complete ban on discards in the case of flounder or other flatfish is not justified, as this will have a negative impact on their stocks."
"Bearing in mind the need for the fishery to remain stable and predictable, and for fish stocks to be exploited within established limits, concern should be expressed that a ban on discards might be used to legalise the large-scale industrial fishing of under-sized cod in the Baltic Sea."
"Due to a lack of reliable scientific data on the basis of which cod by-catches in industrial fisheries can be assessed, it is essential that full documentation of catches should be introduced immediately, together with full monitoring of the vessels engaged in these fishing activities."
"There must be 100% monitoring of industrial catches at landing, otherwise the policy of protecting Baltic fish stocks would be unrealistic and the long-term cod management plan pointless."
"The Union must take immediate action under the common fisheries policy to settle the issue of industrial fishing in the Baltic Sea, bearing in mind that, from an environmental point of view, such fishing is harmful to the Baltic's ecosystem, particularly as the Baltic Sea has been classified as a 'particularly sensitive sea area' by the International Maritime Organisation's Marine Environment Protection Committee, and is therefore among the most precious and most sensitive marine ecosystems in the world."
"In view of the climate changes in the Baltic Sea which are causing different species of fish to adapt to this, meaning that their migration and spawning patterns are also changing, a review should be carried out of the marine protection areas in the Baltic Sea and a long-term management plan for flatfish species drawn up in this area."
"In view of a lack of reliable and up-to-date data on the basis of which a decision can be taken to leave certain areas of the Baltic Sea unprotected, the changes which are occurring should be taken into consideration and a review of protected areas carried out."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the introduction of alien species is one of the main factors in the disturbance of ecosystems and one of the main reasons for global biodiversity loss."
"As the Commission itself notes, the introduction of alien species into Europe's coastal seas and inland waters is due in a great many cases to aquaculture and stocking practices."
"The Commission's proposed amendment to the regulation concerning the use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture is based on the results of a research project, the IMPASSE project, which has brought together various European institutions in a concerted action focusing on the environmental impacts of alien species in aquaculture."
"This project proposes an operational definition of a closed aquaculture facility, giving greater detail to and expanding the definition currently in use."
"In line with this definition and according to the conclusions of the project, 'the degree of risk associated with alien species could be reduced considerably, possibly to an acceptable level, if the potential for escape of target and non-target organisms is addressed during transportation and by well-defined protocols at the receiving facility'."
"In view of the results of this project, the Commission is proposing to ease the unnecessary administrative formalities required of operators by proposing to dispense with the permit requirement for introductions and translocations for closed aquaculture facilities."
"It should be stressed here that, while the risk assessment process is based on scientific and technical analyses, the verdict on the acceptability of risk is the subject of a political decision."
"We therefore believe that relaxing the introduction procedure for alien species in aquaculture must go hand in hand with the most stringent definition possible of the requirements with which closed aquaculture facilities will have to comply, in keeping with the results of the IMPASSE project."
"The need to supervise the facilities must also be established, with the aim of ensuring that all technical requirements put forward by the experts are actually taken into account and complied with during the operation of the facilities."
"This also applies to the care to be taken in transporting target and non-target species to or from the facilities."
"These were the main concerns in drawing up the report and the proposed amendments to the Commission's original proposal."
"Allow me to make one further comment: The sustainable development of aquaculture demands substantial support for scientific research and technological development in the area of farming native species, so as to enable production and diversification in the supply of foodstuffs, along with an improvement in quality, while also guaranteeing greater environmental security."
"This legislative initiative should therefore be backed up by strong backing for this area."
"It is necessary to explore the potential of aquaculture, but there is also a need to overcome its limitations in an environmentally sustainable way."
"Among other things, it will be vital to refocus the priorities of the Framework Research Programme, so as to enable adequate coverage of this important area of research."
"It only remains for me to express my gratitude to all the shadow rapporteurs for their help, thanks to which it was possible to complete a fruitful piece of work, and to the services of the Commission and the Council, including the Spanish Presidency and now the Belgian Presidency, for the work that we have carried out over these months."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the long-term anchovy plan, but I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Bilbao, and all the members of the Committee on Fisheries, for their work on this proposal."
"I would like to say to Mrs Bilbao that there was indeed a delay in adopting this proposal, but I would like to say that it was clear enough that the Commission has done absolutely everything to unblock the situation."
"The anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay was threatened with collapse and the fishery was therefore closed in 2005."
"It was reopened in January 2010, just five years later."
"Last July, scientists confirmed that the stock was safely above precautionary limits."
"This allowed me to propose a TAC of over 15 000 tonnes, which is in force now."
"The TAC follows the harvest rules of the plan and I am happy to see that this proposal is already helping us to manage the stock properly."
"Clearly, the long closure caused serious financial damage to those depending on this fishery."
"We absolutely need to prevent this happening again."
"The only way to do that is to exploit the stock consistent with maximum sustainable yield and keep a low risk of fishery closure."
"Our proposal shows that this can be done while, at the same time, providing sustainability for the industry."
"If we want to avoid closure, then we need to keep the exploitation rate at 30%."
"I would like to thank the Committee on Fisheries for its support both on the substance and in relation to the delegation of powers to the Commission."
"I can support these amendments."
"I can also support those amendments related to the alignment of the proposal with the new control regulation, in force since January 2010."
"There is only one exception, however."
"It relates to reducing the delay for notifying entry into port from four hours to one hour."
"This amendment changes the four-hour rule which is in the new control regulation."
"You know that this new control regulation has been in force since the beginning of this year."
"I am not in favour of amending it so soon, especially since the control regulation itself allows coastal Member States to apply specific exceptions when justified."
"So we have this margin."
"We really do not need to change this control regulation so soon but, of course, it is for you to decide."
"I will turn now to the second report, the multiannual plan for horse mackerel."
"Let me say that Mr Gallagher, as rapporteur, and all the members of the Committee on Fisheries, have done excellent work on this proposal and I would like to pass on to you my sincere thanks for all your hard work and your constructive approach."
"Western horse mackerel is by far the most important of the three horse mackerel stocks in EU waters."
"The stock is currently stable at a good level, which means the TAC for 2011 is almost unchanged."
"The annual TAC decision on this stock, which is based on recent scientific advice, does not correspond to our objective of having binding, predictable long-term management."
"Therefore, this plan, like other long-term plans, is dear to me because I want us to move away from the annual haggling in Council on how much can be fished."
"We owe it to the industry to give them more planning and stability by agreeing on long-term plans."
"Your general support, both on the substance and on the delegation of powers, shows that we have the same goal."
"I can support your amendments and those related to the alignment of the proposal with the new control regulation, in force since January 2010."
"Other than this, the plan itself should not fix TAC areas, leaving the possibility of adapting these in the annual TAC decisions following the relevant scientific advice."
"There is one amendment, however, that does not go in the right direction, namely, your acceptance of the Council Presidency's compromise of around 5 000 tonnes."
"The figure of 5 000 tonnes is simply not science-based."
"How has it been decided upon?"
"Why not 6 000 or 7 000?"
"Having discretion to move the TAC up and down to the right levels in a long-term management strategy does not seem to me a robust approach."
"I will turn now to the third report on the Baltic technical measures."
"I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr GrÃ³barczyk, for his very good work on the report, which was adopted unanimously."
"Once again, I thank the Committee on Fisheries for fully supporting it."
"With this proposal, we are ensuring legal continuity in respect of our policy on high grading, which was introduced in the Baltic Sea last year, as well as on fishing restrictions for some species."
"I will now focus on the last report: the use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ferreira, for his work, and the Committee on Fisheries as a whole."
"As you know, the Commission is committed to promoting the sustainable development of aquaculture in the EU through the new aquaculture strategy."
"This implies a high level of environmental protection, but also the establishment of the conditions to facilitate aquaculture operations."
"We need to do that."
"Amending the regulation on the introduction of alien species in aquaculture closed facilities will certainly facilitate aquaculture activities by eliminating unnecessary administrative burdens whilst, at the same time, ensuring adequate protection for aquatic habitats."
"This is not all that we can do, of course, so I very much welcome the proposal by Mr Ferreira to enhance our research efforts on aquaculture."
"We are going to do our best by means of our budget and by means of CFP reform."
"I am very pleased that the discussions in the Committee on Fisheries have resulted in a better definition of 'closed aquaculture facility'."
"I would like to stress that the initial proposal was adopted by the Commission one month before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, so we had the same problem here."
"The Committee on Fisheries tabled amendments aiming to bring the basic regulation into line with the new comitology provisions of the Lisbon Treaty."
"We considered it opportune to carry out this alignment as proposed by Parliament."
"On the other hand, it was necessary to modify our proposal formally to introduce such substantial amendments, and this accounts for the delay we are talking about."
"To conclude, I would like once again to thank all the rapporteurs in the Committee on Fisheries for their reports and for their work on these relevant issues."
"Mr President, thank you very much to the authors of the reports for their excellent work."
"I would like to focus on management plans, although I will not go into any substantial aspects, as they have already been highlighted by the rapporteurs."
"Instead, I will refer to the significant institutional challenges they are creating, which must be resolved."
"After more than a year of negotiations with the Council, Parliament has quite responsibly decided to bring the reports to first reading with the aim of exerting pressure to break the current deadlock, which affects not only these two proposals but also all the others that are to be put before us in the near future."
"Parliament is willing to find a compromise solution with the Council and the Commission but the key requirement for that to happen is for the Council to acknowledge and accept that the basic core of long-term management plans must fall under the ordinary legislative procedure, that is, under the legal basis of Article 43(2) of the treaty."
"It is incomprehensible that before the Treaty of Lisbon, when the Council also had exclusive competence in matters of TAC and quotas, Parliament was asked for its consultative opinion, whereas now, the Council claims exclusivity on these same matters, even though, according to all legal advice, Article 43(3) must be interpreted restrictively."
"I therefore urge the Commissioner to take account of Parliament's position, even if any proposals - and I believe Mrs Bilbao's question on this particular point has not been answered - were to be withdrawn or replaced by new texts."
"Failure to do this will compel us to refer the matter to the Court of Justice and to block future long-term plans, which is to be avoided insofar as it is a basic instrument of fisheries management."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there are a great many technical details in the texts we are debating today."
"However, behind them stands a clear instruction: the European Parliament is calling on the other institutions, the Commission and the Council, to pay attention to scientific data whenever we pass decisions on fisheries issues and how we fish."
"We cannot negotiate along political lines when deciding how to fish each species of fish."
"The Council and Parliament cannot negotiate along political lines issues which need to be judged on the basis of scientific data."
"It is only on the basis of scientific data that we can establish the surpluses in our seas and what we can fish without having an irreversible impact both on marine life and on fisheries."
"We have before us the revised common fisheries policy."
"What we are asking in these reports is that you act boldly when revising the common fisheries policy, by ensuring that decisions taken to safeguard a viable future for our seas and fisheries are taken on the basis of scientific data."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will concentrate on the report on anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay and our group's view on this matter."
"This is an issue that is extremely important and it is an example of how we should approach sensitive matters relating to fisheries."
"It is important to remember that the fisheries that we are talking about collapsed in 2005 as a result of overfishing."
"Now that fishing is permitted again, it is carried out on the basis of the precautionary principle, and that is the way it should be done."
"It is the only long-term and sustainable way to do it, which was also our group's view on this matter."
"The fact is that the fisheries industry may perhaps hope for a larger quantity of fish to start with, but in the long term, it is better to do what we will probably opt for now."
"This is also the way that our group believes we should handle this type of question, both today and in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has altered Parliament's power when it comes to fisheries policy."
"The management plans that we are to vote on tomorrow will be the first test of how well Parliament is living up to this responsibility."
"I think that, in the main, we have coped well with the challenge, but it has not been without its false alarms."
"There is always a temptation for the decision makers to compromise on scientific advice out of a misguided consideration for the fisheries industry."
"Moreover, people have short memories."
"Despite the fact that anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay collapsed as recently as 2005 and the fisheries industry had to stop fishing completely, there are still short-sighted financial incentives that jeopardise the long-term sustainability of the stocks."
"However, caution won out against games of chance in committee."
"Counting fish is not difficult; it is like counting trees."
"It is just that fish move around and they are not visible."
"Thus joked the world-leading marine biologist Willy Kristensen in the film 'The End of the Line' on the depletion of fish stocks in the world's oceans."
"What he was trying to say was that there is a large degree of uncertainty in stock estimations."
"This is important to remember now that the EU and the world have decided to achieve the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in respect of all commercial fish species in approximately five years."
"I would like to point out that it is an utterly impossible task to achieve the MSY for all fish species everywhere at the same time."
"We therefore need to have safety margins."
"Ecosystems must be considered as a whole and the MSY must be regarded as an upper limit, not as a goal."
"I hope this will be taken into account in the forthcoming fisheries policy and respected in the management plans, both in Parliament and in the Council."
"We need to get long-term management plans in place quickly for all of Europe's marine ecosystems."
"Finally, I would just like to say that I totally agree with the rapporteur, Mr Gallagher, that splitting up a quota for a single stock of horse mackerel goes completely against scientific advice."
"Mr President, the issues raised in this debate are not specific to the area specified."
"There are also issues affecting vessels in the North Sea."
"I had a meeting with fishermen from Whitby in Yorkshire on Friday."
"They are just as concerned with issues that are likely to drive out of business the remaining vessels in the British fleet."
"The immediate threat is of a proposed reduction in the number of days they are allowed to fish, from 135 days possibly down to 90 days."
"I asked the trawlermen how much of a reduction they could bear before being driven out of business, and they replied that any reduction would have that effect."
"The policy of forcing trawlers to discard dead and dying fish to avoid landing under-sized fish or exceeding species quotas is absolutely monstrous."
"All fish that have been caught and will not survive must be landed."
"Discarding is not conservation, it is waste."
"High grading is a response to the unfair quota system."
"Reform the system and it will disappear."
"Quotas are bought and sold on the open market and speculated by the rich and powerful."
"This pushes up the price of quotas, which are rented to fishermen for extortionate amounts."
"Speculation must be ended completely."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the Gallagher report and, in particular, the multiannual plan for the stock of Atlantic horse mackerel, it is vital to advocate the amendment proposed by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which was drawn up by Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves, focusing on the three objectives of the Green Paper and the reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP): the environmental objective, which is well respected in this report, and the economic and social objectives, whether they focus on economic viability or a decent living for professionals."
"It is very important that we make a distinction here."
"When we talk about the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel, it is important to distinguish between Zone VIII C, the area around the Bay of Biscay, which is essentially geared to artisanal fisheries and which forms the livelihood for a significant part of the Portuguese, Spanish and French populations, in particular, and the zone further north, which is focused on industrial fisheries, and is thus essentially geared towards economic profitability."
"For this very reason, there needs to be an amendment to this report so that it is harmonised not only with the fundamental objectives of the Green Paper on the CFP or on the reform of the CFP, but also with the recommendations presented by the Council on the Regulation on total allowable catches (TACs) for 2011, in which Atlantic horse mackerel in International Council for the Exploration of the Sea Zone VIII C is essentially seen as geared towards artisanal fisheries, while the north, within this western zone, is mainly focused on industrial fisheries."
"This approach, which looks at the specific nature and purpose of each area where the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel lives, is the only one that can truly protect all the aims of the CFP."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, congratulations to the four rapporteurs."
"I, too, am going to address the issue of management plans for anchovy and Atlantic horse mackerel stocks."
"The proposal on the exploitation of anchovy stocks, which was initially going to be a proposal for sustainable anchovy exploitation, has proved a complex proposal which is currently blocked by the Council."
"This is the sector that has suffered the greatest damage."
"We are at a standstill because the situation has not been unblocked due to a failure to take decisions on the part of the Council and also the Commission."
"I would like to highlight the position of the Spanish socialist delegation, which has supported the sector's unanimous claims throughout this process, backed - and I stress, backed - by scientific reports and by the Regional Advisory Council."
"This same position is maintained in relation to the new issues raised by the upcoming reform of the common fisheries policy."
"In the face of this stalemate, we request that the Commissioner withdraws the proposal if necessary, takes into account the position of Parliament, and puts forward a new proposal."
"As for Atlantic horse mackerel, Mr Gallagher has outlined several issues on which we also agree, such as the introduction of multiannual programmes, total allowable catches and scientific recommendations."
"He also proposed an amendment that the Socialist Group regards as significant and which the Spanish Socialist Group also regards as significant, as Spain has a traditional horse mackerel fishing sector, the produce of which is consumed fresh on the same day it has been caught."
"The lack of recognition of this sector will result in socio-economic damage and will certainly weaken the prospects for improved management."
"For this reason, we believe that Mr Gallagher should have taken our proposal into consideration, differentiating the case of coastal fishing."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks to the rapporteurs."
"In view of the high level of imports of fish and fish products into the EU, it is essential that we maintain and support our local fishermen, as well as the domestic aquaculture sector."
"We urgently need improved catch methods in order to secure the long-term livelihood of both our seas and our fishermen."
"It is equally essential that we enable aquaculture to expand further."
"We are in urgent need of more effective data collection and more intensive research, since only once we know what is actually going on will we be able to make the right decisions for the future."
"Our lack of success in combining economics with ecology - which are not actually that different - is often down to excessive bureaucracy and insufficient knowledge."
"(ES) Mr President, with regard to the debate on anchovies, I would also like to highlight how important it is and the fact that it is a turning point, not only for the sector, and for the subject of anchovies in particular, but also for relations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"In this respect, I would also like to make it very clear that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the proposals that were made by the Commission from a more precautionary perspective."
"We fundamentally support the proposals on three points:"
"the first is the exploitation rule, which we - like the Commission - consider should not be greater than 0.3; the second is the total allowable catch (TAC), which we also consider should take into account live bait; the final point is the reduction of the TAC, which must be at least 25%, if it is deemed necessary."
"We have supported the Commission on these three matters, and we think this is reasonable, precisely because what we want to do is act, for once, like holistic doctors who cure, rather than forensic doctors who simply certify deaths."
"I believe it is important that we make this message clear and I think that this is a good opportunity to do things properly."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my contribution concerns the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the prohibition of highgrading and restrictions on fishing for flounder and turbot in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound."
"What we are concerned with here is not simply the amendment of a regulation, but two very important and excellent species of food fish that we urgently need in Europe for our internal market."
"Once again, it is clear that science and the industry need to work together to ensure that their experience - particularly in the areas of discards and the management of stocks, but also as regards what happens to by-catches - is evaluated and assessed sensibly."
"We know all the options for imposing restrictions here;"
"Mr GrÃ³barczyk has set them out excellently."
"It is essential that Article 15a is included in the regulation."
"You have heard why - the rapporteur has once more stated it quite clearly."
"Our common aim is to minimise by-catches and discards, and we achieved this in committee."
"However, for some species of fish - and flounder and turbot are among them - it is the case that juvenile and under-sized specimens can be thrown back if they have been taken on board with the catch."
"Naturally, it is also essential to work with excellent fishing gear here, to fish selectively and to respect closed seasons."
"These two species of fish have constantly changed their spawning grounds, so naturally, the fishing areas have also been clearly defined, and the spawning times and spawning grounds described precisely."
"The marketing parameters must not be revised downward so that the only possibility left is to make fishmeal from such excellent stocks."
"That is not our aim."
"We want to serve the market, which is why we have amended this regulation in this way."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, I am very pleased that this week, we are able to adopt four important regulations on fisheries policy, and that we have been able to reach agreement among ourselves as well as with the Council and Commission on the reports concerning aquaculture and technical measures in the Baltic Sea."
"Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the two regulations on long-term management plans."
"The right formula for management of sardine stocks has always been subject to considerable argument among the committee."
"I believe that the submission to plenary looks very good and I am pleased that it seems that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has also now realised this, as it has tabled no more amendments."
"I assume that you will be voting in favour tomorrow."
"We have a much more serious problem where the Council is concerned, however."
"Contrary to the advice of their own legal experts, the majority of the Member States are refusing to accept the European Parliament's right of codecision - a full year after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon!"
"I consider that outrageous."
"I have therefore suggested to the chair of our committee that a joint letter be written to the European fisheries ministers."
"I would be pleased if we could reach agreement in the coming days so that together, we can demonstrate how determined Parliament is."
"We will not allow ourselves to be fobbed off by the Council so easily."
"Mr President, I support the line taken by Mr Gallagher in his report and will be voting accordingly tomorrow, when we get to that."
"The principle of multiannual planning is a sensible one if it allows for reasonable forward planning on the part of fishers and also the processing sector."
"But, in general, there remain some very negative aspects of EU fisheries management, as you are aware."
"I strongly believe that it is the fishing nations themselves - those who have entitlement in particular sea areas - who should be making the decisions on stock conservation and management."
"A number of speakers have again referred to the scandal of discards."
"There is a growing awareness in Scotland that discards are a direct result of EU regulation and, in particular, the cod recovery plan."
"I hope the Commissioner will take note of this and take action to deal with that part of the discard scandal, which could be avoided by changing some of the unworkable regulations which currently apply."
"(ES) Mr President, in my speech, I am going to focus on two reports whose procedure and final results are an example of what to do and what not to do."
"I am referring to the plan for anchovy stocks and the use of exotic species in aquaculture."
"Regarding anchovies, an example of how not to do things, the subject has been under discussion for more than one year and, unfortunately, it has become a debate on the powers that the Treaty of Lisbon grants to Parliament and on the legal basis for the Commission proposal, rather than a debate on what is better for fishermen, industries and fisheries."
"It has been a long and futile debate, the victim of which has been the sector, which has looked on in astonishment as we have become lost in discussions while the long-awaited management plan has yet to move forward and is in danger of never seeing the light of day."
"People who work in the anchovy sector are rightly complaining about the administrative hindrances that this plan is facing, when it is so essential for avoiding further interruptions to the activities of this fishery."
"I sincerely believe that, given this background of uncertainty, the Commission should seek to send a positive signal to the sector today in Parliament."
"On the contrary, with regard to the use of exotic species, the agreement reached by Parliament at first reading is a good compromise."
"The Commission, the Council and Parliament have succeeded in reaching an agreement quickly and without major disagreements over law or fact."
"The agreement not only establishes a strict definition of closed aquaculture facilities, but also achieves greater legal clarity for the businesses in the sector and, more importantly, removes a piece of the bureaucracy that Europeans have had enough of."
"I am convinced that the administrative processes need to be reduced to an essential minimum."
"Europeans have to deal with excessive bureaucracy, which makes it extremely difficult to start up or operate any activity."
"Therefore, reports such as today's that remove administrative procedures are not only good news for the aquaculture sector but should also be a constant feature of the way in which we work."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner Damanaki, I am going to focus on the GrÃ³barczyk and Ferreira reports."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on having reached agreements at first reading with the Council to revise two regulations that adapt the fisheries policy to the Treaty of Lisbon and highlight the European Union's commitment to sustainable fisheries management and the conservation of biodiversity."
"The prohibition of high grading and restrictions on flounder and turbot fishing in the Baltic Sea are essential measures for effective and adequate resource management."
"It is appropriate to incorporate them permanently into the Technical Measures Regulation for those waters."
"This focus could be extended to the rest of EU waters and form part of the no-discards policy of the upcoming reform of the common fisheries policy."
"It is also essential that the European Union updates the definition and operative conditions for closed aquaculture facilities, considers how to publish the list and establishes, in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, the procedures for EU development or implementation of the rules aimed at avoiding pollution from those activities that could endanger or affect our ecosystems."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate our fellow Members, Mrs Bilbao, and Messrs Gallagher, GrÃ³barczyk and Ferreira, on their reports."
"I would like to say how pleased I am to see Parliament conclude its first reading on the two long-term plans for anchovies and horse mackerel."
"In fact, with the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has become a joint decision maker on these matters."
"With regard to the anchovy stock, I am delighted by the text adopted in the Committee on Fisheries, which is aimed at long-term management of a much fished species."
"This plan will allow for joint management measures between the main fishing countries."
"Live bait will be taken into consideration in the quotas, making it possible to check the quantities fished in the fairest way."
"Moreover, I welcome the measures for supervising control of this fishery."
"The system for controlling vessels absolutely must be the same in the various Member States exploiting this stock."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Gallagher on his report."
"I know we shall adopt it tomorrow: it makes the socio-economically and environmentally sustainable exploitation of the mackerel stock possible."
"This plan comes up with a new decision-making method concerning the total allowable catch that will make it possible to ensure the sustainability of the stock in the long term."
"I would also like to remind you of the importance of the principle of relative stability, which is particularly close to my heart."
"The rapporteurs stress the need to tackle discards, and this can only be welcomed."
"However, like my fellow Members, I find it regrettable that the Council is challenging Parliament's new joint decision-making power concerning the long-term management plans."
"I think that this issue of a legal basis needs to be resolved as it is delaying implementation of the plans, which is essential for conserving the resource and regulating fishing."
"We must also define, once and for all, the notions of non-industrial fishing and industrial fishing."
"This will ensure that the reform of the common fisheries policy is undertaken on a sound and firm footing."
"This is also what is suggested in the report by Mr GrÃ³barczyk, whom I thank for the quality of his work."
"Moreover, a total ban on discards is not realistic, as we know."
"I hope that the European Commission will support the sector, which is introducing selective gear and ensuring economically and environmentally sustainable fishing."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one minute is not long enough to cover four reports."
"I therefore congratulate the three other rapporteurs, but I will only comment on Mr Ferreira's report."
"Adherence to the principles of biodiversity must be central to the actions which the European Union undertakes with regard to fishing and aquaculture."
"The compromise amendment is the result of the good work carried out by Mr Ferreira, who has clearly understood these concerns."
"We must not have preconceived ideas when looking for ways to improve fish farming standards, but we must be rigorous in the control and application of regulations which are as precise as possible, in order to avoid the risk of altering the environmental balance."
"In this way, the greatest support for organic production is a decision which is made in the general interest and which encompasses the protection of biodiversity."
"That, in fact, is the best way of optimising the production of native species."
"Commissioner, I hope that, as part of the common fisheries policy reform, this further measure with regard to aquaculture can be included in one simplified regulation."
"This will simplify matters greatly, and I hope that a single regulation on aquaculture will make the procedures as a whole even simpler."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr GrÃ³barczyk for his help."
"I am very pleased that it was possible to include a very significant point in the report, calling on the Commission to prepare a comprehensive management plan for flounder in the waters of the Baltic Sea."
"I would like to take the opportunity to bring to the Commissioner's attention the fact that the Polish authorities have been proposing the adoption of a comprehensive management system for flatfish stocks in the Baltic for many years, and have not obtained any tangible results from the European Commission."
"A uniform system for the management of flatfish, wherever they may be located, must be drawn up."
"They have great economic importance for Baltic fishermen, including those from Poland, which is why they merit greater attention from European institutions responsible for fisheries than they have enjoyed so far."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their reports and, in particular, Mr Gallagher."
"Two things jump out at me immediately in hearing the discussion that has gone on."
"The first thing is that the whole concept of creating an opportunity to allow for a split within the TACs in one fishery is irresponsible to the extreme."
"We should strongly oppose that."
"Secondly, with regard to the issue of discards, maybe now is the time to look at creating a grey market for those discards."
"They are by-catches to normal fishery operations and instead of them being thrown back into the water, why not allow them to be landed and pay for the cost of catch - not a market price, but the cost of catch."
"This can be used as a replacement for the thousands of tonnes of imported fish, coming from the Far East and other places, to fill other markets within the European Union."
"This can be a win-win situation."
"It can reduce the amount of discards and also ensure that fishermen are not throwing back a valuable product."
"Mr President, it is good that the EU is trying to preserve endangered fish stocks, but before there is too much self-congratulation on these proposals, we must remember that many past EU fishing rules have been appalling failures."
"Britain's home waters have been fished to near extinction under European fisheries policies."
"The reality is that the protection of fish stocks is best left to local fishermen and national government marine scientists, not EU bureaucrats."
"The advice from the men working in the broken remnants of Britain's fishing fleets is simple: scrap quota systems, which lead to discards and high grading, and replace them with weight-based catch limits so that all fish caught are landed for human consumption or for processing into animal and fish feed."
"We need to replace the system of openly tradeable quotas and so stop financiers, supermarkets and the super rich from speculating in fishermen's livelihoods."
"Quotas of all kinds - and in whichever seas - should be owned by fishermen from ports with traditional connections to those waters and be tradeable only between fishermen who are likewise entitled to fish by personal, family and community connections."
"(GA) Mr President, I am no authority on this matter, but since I come from an island nation, I know that fishing is very important for coastal communities throughout Ireland."
"My esteemed Irish colleague, Mr Gallagher, who is an authority on this topic not just in Ireland but beyond, made some very pertinent points when he spoke about the nonsense of shared quotas for two separate areas for the one stock."
"My group, the PPE Group, has a different view."
"At the same time, what Mr Gallagher says seems to be logical, as horse mackerel is a transient species."
"So I would like the Commissioner's response to that in particular: not a personal response but one based on scientific evidence."
"I would also agree with colleagues regarding discards, and I would also like to see us developing aquaculture much more ..."
"(GA) because there will be more and more demand for fish in the future, and I hope that every kind of fish will be available to all."
"Mr President, I have recently been trying to establish the cost of the common fisheries policy to the British economy."
"The best estimate in lost catch alone is at least GBP 3.6 billion per annum; the cost of higher food bills is put at around GBP 4.7 billion per annum; the cost of subsidies, unemployment, wasted resources, red tape, etc. is put at about GBP 2.8 billion per annum."
"This makes an annual total upwards of GBP 11.1 billion."
"The fishing industry has been devastated, with over 97 000 jobs lost since 1973 in fishing and dependent industries."
"The knock-on economic and human costs are incalculable; the ecological impact of the common fisheries policy is a disaster."
"Over 880 000 dead fish are dumped into the North Sea every year."
"The solution for Britain is, of course, to leave the European Union, regain control of our territorial waters and restore sanity to a revitalised national fishing industry."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay ceased in 2005 due to the poor state of stocks."
"The aim of the proposed plan is to ensure sustainable fishing by establishing quotas based on scientific criteria."
"This plan is supported by the sector, which needs stability."
"I ask the Commission to withdraw this proposal and to take account of Parliament's initiative."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank all the honourable Members of Parliament for their contributions."
"The discussion was very interesting indeed."
"First, I would like to react to the remarks of Mrs Fraga, on behalf of the EPP and of other Members, about the institutional problems we have now, referring to the new institutional environment we have under the Lisbon Treaty."
"I have to admit that the enforcement of the Lisbon Treaty has created a new era, and we would like to adapt to this new era."
"I would like to say in a very clear way that the Commission understands and supports the idea that Parliament has to have a say in terms of the harvest: the role of the long management plan."
"We think that the treaties are very clear when they refer to this issue."
"This is our position but, as you know, there is a reaction in the Council."
"Some Member States have reacted in a very strong way, but also there is a general reaction to this approach."
"We have to find a solution here, because otherwise we cannot go on to enforce long management plans and, as you will understand, long management plans are our future."
"We cannot go on with a new policy dictated by short-termism and all these political bargains we are used to."
"So we have to find a solution to unblock the situation."
"I have in mind to try to find a way out by means of a trilateral meeting."
"I am going to propose to Parliament and the Council that we all sit together in order to find at least a compromise solution, which we need as soon as possible because we cannot go on in this way."
"All the long management plans are blocked now, and I have some new proposals about some new management plans, which are very important for salmon, for example, and for pelagic stocks."
"These are very important long management plans."
"They are ready and we are waiting to find an institutional solution to these very sensitive problems."
"Referring to the contributions of the other groups, I would like to welcome the contributions of Mr Arsenis, Mr Haglund and Ms LÃ¶vin on behalf of their groups and to agree with them that what we need is long management plans and scientific advice."
"I understand and I would like to be very clear on the demands of our fisheries and the problems of our fisheries sector."
"But I would like to tell you that we are now discussing a clear example of the situation."
"The anchovy plan and the fact that we had to close the fisheries there for some years is clear proof that we cannot go forward while ignoring scientific advice."
"I understand the problems, and we have to find a synthesis and a solution."
"My idea - and this will be one of the main themes of our fisheries policy reform - is to continue heeding scientific advice and also try to find a solution in case that advice is not clear enough and we do not have enough data to form a clear opinion."
"I would also like to say that the report by Mr GrÃ³barczyk is very important, and that technical measures concerning how to avoid upgrading are very important for our policy."
"I would also like to underline that we need a policy on flounders and flatfish, as we have already said."
"We intend to produce such a policy."
"We need a very brave policy regarding discards, to which a lot of you referred."
"I do not think we can afford to throw fish back in the sea when they are so valuable."
"We cannot afford this any more."
"Perhaps it was a solution when we had plenty of fish in our waters, but now we have real problems."
"We cannot throw fish back in the sea."
"So we have to find a solution here, and I very much welcome proposals such as compensating fishermen for the cost of the catch in the case of by-catches."
"We can find solutions, but what we have to do through our policy reform is move towards a target of eliminating discards."
"Of course, we have to bear in mind all the technical measures needed for this, but we have to move in this direction."
"One last remark about the aquaculture problems."
"We have to reduce the burdens which create obstacles in aquaculture."
"I can agree with that."
"I can agree with the rapporteur and Mr Milana and other speakers who have spoken about it."
"What I can say is that we are trying to achieve this as part of our CFP reform."
"I would also like to reiterate that we are going to increase scientific research into aquaculture species, because we really need to proceed to mass production of these aquaculture products if we really want aquaculture to be an alternative to our fishing sector."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first, I would have appreciated a clear answer from you as to whether it is your intention to give in to the Council's wishes, acknowledging - which I am grateful for - the problems regarding acceptance of the powers that the Treaty of Lisbon gives to Parliament."
"The Committee on Fisheries has voted for a second time and has not asked the Commissioner to withdraw the proposal."
"What we are asking the Commissioner to do today is to give us an answer as to whether or not she is going to give in to what the Council wants."
"The sector needs a plan."
"The sector has been responsible and has worked for more than two years with scientific institutes and the Commission in order to establish and set out the exploitation rule in the proposal."
"It is a responsible sector which has been closed for five years, and let it not be forgotten that it was the sector itself that asked for the closure."
"The year before the closure, it was able to fish 7 000 tonnes and each day it established and set the quota that could be fished in order to make that small quota more profitable."
"It then unilaterally decided to notify the Commission that it was stopping fishing because it had reached the limit set."
"That is the sector that we have."
"It is a sector that has asked us more than once to make a decision and to be transparent, and one that I can personally say has worked responsibly and rigorously to get to this much needed plan."
"Adopting this plan means moving away from obscure political decisions on quotas and total allowable catches, the basis for which is sometimes unknown."
"We have lived for many years with this lack of transparency."
"The 21st century is not the century of non-transparency and that is not what the European people deserve, nor is it what is deserved by a sector that has proved itself to be responsible."
"Fortunately, the latest report conducted by AZTI (Basque Scientific Institute) and the Juvena study have shown us that there are much greater anchovy stocks for the coming year."
"I would, however, like a clearer answer, Commissioner."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and colleagues for their contributions, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, the secretariat of the Fisheries Committee, the Council, the Commission, my group's policy adviser, and indeed my own adviser."
"I understand that the Council, at a technical level, is divided as to whether or not the harvest control rule should be exclusively decided by the Council."
"I also understand that the 27 Ministers have yet to discuss this dossier in full, and this issue in particular."
"I hope that common sense will prevail."
"With regard to the Commissioner's difficulty with +/-5 000 tonnes, I would say to you, Commissioner, that this was a pragmatic solution."
"We have been dealing with this dossier for over a year now and it was a way forward."
"I believe that at times, we have to be pragmatic in order to overcome the difficulty."
"I would like to say to those in the S&D Group that there is absolutely no ambiguity about my position in relation to your amendment."
"I will certainly be recommending that we support that amendment."
"In relation to the PPE Group's proposal, I would say that the PPE Group should reflect on this."
"I was very careful to include its concerns in Amendment 7, which deals with the Bay of Biscay."
"It deals with artisanal fisheries and historic rights."
"Anyone who supports that must remember that we will have many more reports in Parliament."
"If you support something that is wrong now, it may well be that, if you are to be consistent, you will have to support something that is wrong in the future."
"Scientifically, it is totally wrong to split a TAC, and that is not just my personal opinion."
"If we do it now, we may well have to do it in the future in a one-stock fishery."
"Multiannual plans are vital to allow the sector to plan forward."
"Hopefully, good sense will prevail tomorrow and we will put in place a report that we can stand over."
"Mr President, once again, I would like to express my very sincere thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs, especially those present - Mrs Ulrike Rodust, Mr Kuhn and Mr Ferreira, and also to Mr Kuhn and Mr Alain Cadec, for their warm and kind words on the subject of my report."
"I, too, hope that the report will function as a continuation of accepted solutions and, above all, as the start of work on regionalisation."
"Regionalisation is our objective and what we are striving for in the common fisheries policy."
"This is what will determine the success of the future common fisheries policy in practice."
"rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, I would like to express my thanks for the comments that were made on my report and use my floor time to make a few remarks about the multiannual plan for the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel and the proposed amendment to Mr Gallagher's report that I presented on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left."
"The purpose of this amendment, which the rapporteur's Amendment 7 does not completely ensure, is to clarify the specific nature of the different fleets and make clear that these specific points and the ultimate destination of the fish should be taken into account when defining the total allowable catches (TACs)."
"Small-scale coastal and artisanal fisheries have economic and social characteristics that are distinct from those of industrial fisheries, among other aspects."
"When setting limitations on fisheries aimed at supplying fresh fish to the public for consumption, these should not be treated in the same way as industrial fishing, which is geared towards processing fish."
"With regard to the different fleets and the technical issue that was raised, I still do not agree with the rapporteur's position."
"We are effectively talking about the same stock, from the same source, but, as has already been mentioned, this is a source that is developing in distinct fishing areas. Coastal and artisanal fishing ideally operate in a specified fishing area, with industrial fishing in another."
"We are therefore talking about areas that have clearly defined boundaries, and we believe that this is compatible."
"Moreover, we believe that the TACs need to be adjusted to each of these different fishing areas so as to ensure that the stock is managed sensibly."
"This is because, as has also been noted here, sensible management of the stock should take into account not only environmental and biological aspects, but also economic and social factors."
"Things that are essentially different should not be treated in exactly the same way."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow (Tuesday, 23 November 2010)."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The report on the prohibition of highgrading and restrictions on fishing for flounder and turbot in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound calls for new provisions in the regulations on fishing in the areas in question."
"The Baltic Sea has the status of a 'particularly sensitive sea area', and is one of the most valuable, but also one of the most sensitive, marine ecosystems on our planet."
"For this reason, I agree with the rapporteur that it is essential to abandon - and not only here - industrial scale fishing."
"It is only through economically and environmentally balanced fishing, using the right fishing methods, that we can help to preserve fishing and to preserve the current range of fish species at a sustainable level for future generations."
"In connection with climate change, there has been a massive movement of fish in the Baltic Sea, and it is therefore necessary to review the protected sea area regularly."
"I would therefore like to call on the Commission to do this at regular intervals."
"It is also essential for fishing companies to be encouraged through legislation to use the best equipment currently available in terms of selectivity, and thereby to avoid catching such huge quantities of under-sized fish and fish other than the target species, or by-catches."
"The European Parliament should make a point of including this in the proposed reform of the common fisheries policy in 2011, which I will be urgently promoting."
"Information on medicinal products (Community code relating to medicinal products) - Information on medicinal products (Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products) (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"the report by Christofer Fjellner, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending, as regards information to the general public on medicinal products subject to medical prescription, Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use - C6-0516/2008 -, and"
"the report by Christofer Fjellner, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending, as regards information to the general public on medicinal products for human use subject to medical prescription, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency - C6-0517/2008 -."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at last, we have come to the plenary debate on the new legislation on information on medicinal products."
"What we are about to debate is the last part of what certain people are calling the most controversial issue in the medicinal products package, namely, information on medicinal products."
"I will admit that as recently as a year ago, I probably would never have believed that we would come to plenary together in as much agreement as we have nevertheless achieved here in Parliament."
"The fact that this is the case is largely down to my shadow rapporteurs."
"It is their constructive proposals and their willingness to compromise that has helped us to reach agreement and hopefully adopt this report with considerable support in plenary."
"It is not only a question of willingness to compromise."
"I think that perhaps it is even more important that we have realised that we want, and are working for, the same things here in Parliament."
"The first is that we all, first and foremost, want Europe's patients to have better and more accessible information on medicinal products."
"The second is that none of us wants advertising for prescription-only medicinal products, and the third is that the information that reaches patients and is disseminated by companies must be checked and approved by the relevant authorities."
"These are principles that everyone shares and that have made it easier for us to reach agreement."
"However, it is also why we felt somewhat compelled to re-draft the Commission's proposal."
"I would like to highlight five things that we focused on when re-drafting the Commission's original legislative proposal."
"The first is that we tried to change the perspective of the legislation - from a focus on the right of pharmaceutical companies to disseminate information to now focusing on the right of patients to have access to information and, with that, the companies' obligation to publish and make available this information."
"Secondly, we tried to tighten up all of the exceptions that existed to avoid possible loopholes for advertising - something none of us wants."
"Thirdly, we ensured that the information on medicinal products coming from companies is checked and is reliable in that it must have passed through a pharmaceuticals authority somewhere."
"The fourth thing we did was to say that any information that could come from pharmaceutical companies should not be received by patients or the general public without them asking for it first."
"No one should ever receive unsolicited information on medicinal products."
"We have therefore rejected any so-called 'push channels', such as advertisements on the radio, television or in newspapers."
"The last point I would like to highlight is that companies are only one link in the information chain."
"Healthcare and society in many countries throughout Europe must take a much greater share of the responsibility than they currently do."
"There are points on which we do not agree."
"In this regard, I would simply like to ask a question and call on my fellow Members to in fact accept the exception relating to information that doctors give to patients they are treating, in other words, that such information need not go through the same process of checks as other information."
"I have a specific example that could pose a problem if such an exception is not accepted, namely that a doctor in Sweden, for example, would not be able to give an English package leaflet to a patient who does not understand Swedish on account of the fact that it could never be approved in Sweden, as English is not an official language there."
"I will conclude by addressing the Council, which, unfortunately, is not here - something that has been quite telling in this matter."
"I regret the absence of the Council."
"I really wanted to take account of the Council's opinions and arguments in order to facilitate the debate, but as yet I have been met almost entirely by a flat refusal."
"It has been difficult to listen to someone who does not provide any information."
"We have succeeded in reaching agreement on this matter."
"I am certain that the Council, too, if it begins to discuss this matter in detail, will actually encounter more or less the same conditions for agreement as we have created here."
"However, the Council must not try to ration information in order to save money."
"That is not something that we want to encounter."
"We do not believe that more poorly informed patients are in any way easier to deal with or that it is cheaper to withhold information."
"I call on the Council to take the baton so that, together, we can ensure that Europe has better information on medicinal products for the sake of the patients."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, during my hearing as Commissioner-designate, I made it clear that information to patients is a very important topic for me."
"Patients are highly interested in their own health and wellbeing."
"But today, the availability of information on medicines in Europe is very diverse: you could even say very unfair."
"Whether patients obtain the relevant information depends on languages, IT skills and often even social class and networks."
"For a Europe that strives to overcome today's health and inequalities, this is not sustainable."
"The key ambition of the Commission's initial proposal therefore remains justified, and I applaud Parliament and, in particular, your rapporteur, Mr Fjellner, on taking this important proposal forward."
"However, I strongly believe - as I also stressed during my hearing - that we have to address this file from a patient's angle."
"We have to ask what information patients need, not what information industry may wish to provide."
"We have to ensure that we do not drift into direct-to-consumer advertising, which patients clearly do not want."
"Again, I applaud Parliament for taking exactly this stance."
"This will allow the Commission to accept many of your key amendments when we present our modified proposals."
"This concerns, in particular, the obligation to publish information, the question of what information is covered, the information distribution channels and the control mechanisms."
"Firstly, I support the amendment stating that industry must have the obligation and not just the right to make certain information on medicinal products available."
"This is a very important change."
"Secondly, as regards what information is published, I generally agree that information should not cover comparisons between medicinal products, as this could be seen as promotional."
"Of course, this information is highly relevant for patients and healthcare professionals but, due to its potential abuse for promotion, it needs a strict framework."
"We are cooperating with Member States on such a framework in the area of health technology assessments."
"I also share the view that the proposals should concern the information made available by industry and not by third parties such as journalists and scientists."
"However, we know that there is a grey zone which leaves room for abuse."
"I therefore believe that such parties should be obliged to declare whether they have received financial or other benefits from industry."
"Thirdly, as regards the information channels, I partially agree with your amendments."
"However, not everybody uses the Internet; we must avoid corroborating inequalities by excluding those who do not use digital communication tools from access to medical information."
"I consider, therefore, that it should be possible for industry to draft printed material on its own initiative and not only by request."
"This draft information could be used on request by the public or via healthcare professionals."
"Fourthly, on the control of information, I agree that information which has not already been approved during the marketing authorisation process must be pre-approved by competent authorities as a matter of principle."
"However, I believe that Europe should play close attention to the constitutional concerns that some Member States raise as regards the compatibility of pre-vetting with freedom of expression."
"It should be possible for these Member States to provide for exposed control, irrespective of whether they already have such exposed control in place."
"Several of Parliament's amendments concern information from sources other than industry sources."
"In this context, let me stress that I fully agree with the political ambition to place the proposals on industry-generated information on medicines, which we are discussing today, in a broader and more comprehensive agenda on patient information."
"Yes, there are other very important sources which have to be exploited as fully as possible, but the proposals are not the right place to address them."
"The Commission is already obliged to draft a report on the readability of the package leaflet."
"Therefore, any changes regarding this issue would be premature."
"Nor is it feasible to introduce, for each clinical study mentioned in the summary of the European Public Assessment Report, a link to the Eurydice Database on clinical trials."
"A general link between databases would suffice."
"The public summary of the assessment report should not be annexed to the European marketing authorisation, as it is already publicly available through the EMA website."
"I recognise that, in addition to information provided by industry, there are already a number of European and national databases and portals providing information on medicinal products."
"What we lack is interlinkage between them."
"I propose that the future European medicinal web portal recently created by the Pharmacovigilance Directive be used as a central point to access information."
"In this context, I fully recognise the need for broader information about diseases and their prevention."
"Patients are interested in all different treatment options, not just learning about medicines."
"However, this cannot be addressed through the present proposals, which focus on medicines."
"Nevertheless, the Commission is well placed to serve as a European information switchboard."
"I see our role as connecting other reliable information providers such as Member States or patient organisations."
"European action can add value, and many information tools such as the EU health portal are already in place."
"Honourable Members, you will not be surprised that there are some amendments that the Commission, after careful reflection, cannot support."
"The right of citizens to lodge complaints, for example, is a fundamental EU principle."
"It is neither appropriate nor necessary to restate this."
"The level of penalties should be determined at national level and not at European legislative level."
"A list of the Commission's positions on all the proposed amendments has been made available to Parliament."
"Let me conclude by again thanking Parliament and Mr Fjellner and the shadow rapporteurs for your important contribution."
"I hope this week's vote will help strengthen patients' access to information and convince the Council of the need to start in-depth discussions of the proposals."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Dalli, patients should have the right to know as much as possible about their illness and the medication available to treat it."
"Yet how can we distinguish information from advertising?"
"Where and how is it possible to obtain objective and unbiased information?"
"There are various interpretations of the texts currently in force, with the result that they need to be harmonised, strengthening the sovereignty of the individual."
"Information needs to be reliable, validated by the authorities, independent, accessible and targeted to an average, non-expert audience."
"The intention is to ensure more informed and responsible citizenship on the part of the end user."
"The deadline for the tacit approval of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) should be extended from 60 to 120 days."
"The requirement to state the reasons for a refusal lends weight to such rejections and gives balance to the final outcome."
"The EMA has a vital role as the preferred source of objective information."
"I would like to conclude by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Fjellner, on his work, and by saying that I am delighted that he accepted almost all the proposals that I tabled as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the other colleagues who have contributed to this dossier."
"I would also like to congratulate Commissioner Dalli."
"I think we have reached a good outcome, and now the report is much more patient-oriented than the initial proposal."
"Nowadays, patients increasingly tend to seek health-related information so that they can be actively involved in the decisions concerning their health."
"Patients also tend to seek information online."
"This information is not easy to control on the Internet, but sooner or later we have to deal with that problem, which will not disappear if we simply do not do anything because it is too complicated."
"I therefore support imposing strict rules for the registration and monitoring of websites, as well as making available a list of registered websites so that patients can be sure of the reliability of their source."
"Safeguards are also needed, and the report provides them, namely by limiting the information that can be made available to information that is approved by the competent authorities."
"To this end, we in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have adopted a number of amendments covering advertising, concentrating on changing the wording from 'disseminate' to 'make available' in the context of non-promotional information according to the 'pull principle', whereby patients have access to information if they need it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when you consider how we debated this proposal from the Commission during the last parliament - going from outright rejection to celebrating all the good things coming our way - then I must say that I am very enthusiastic about what has been tabled here."
"For this, we owe the rapporteur and his co-rapporteurs a great deal of thanks for having brought together this broad spectrum of opinions into a coherent position."
"I feel that the key words here are 'patient oriented'."
"In other words, we have not been distracted by peripherals but instead have asked what it is that the patient needs."
"I believe it is right that we have established that patients are able to obtain information from a number of channels, not just one."
"I should like to reiterate, however, that the doctor must continue to be the trusted point of contact for the patient and must undoubtedly have an influence over decisions."
"The way we are guaranteeing that is by banning advertising and ensuring that the information patients receive has been checked and approved by an authority."
"This means that the information is based on scientific fact to start with, so patients can rely on it."
"Of course, it is true that not everyone is able to find these things out via the Internet."
"That is why we have various channels, however, and I think it is so widespread that we do not need to worry about that."
"I only hope that the Council will now at last have the courage to deal with this matter."
"It is very important; action needs to be taken quickly."
"Our patients expect it."
"Then we will have done a good job."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the 21st century dawns, patients particularly need appropriate information so that they can be fully involved in the treatment pathway, know where to find treatment, decide on the best treatment with healthcare professionals and follow the planned treatment to the letter."
"Nowadays, patients demand independent, comparative information that is tailored to individual needs."
"Unfortunately, the proposals for the revision of the directive submitted by the European Commission failed to properly meet the needs expressed by European citizens."
"These proposals opened the door to direct promotion by pharmaceutical companies, which we believe is a nonsense in terms of responding to patients' real needs."
"Neither the public nor the Member States stand to gain from this move."
"On the contrary, it means more red tape, increased costs and risks to patients."
"It is for these reasons that we initially submitted a proposal to reject these texts, thereby requiring the Commission to revise its proposals."
"This approach, which was also adopted by my fellow Member, Mr Schlyter, of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, enabled our rapporteur, Mr Fjellner - to whom I pay tribute - to undertake a major review of the Commission's proposals."
"At the same time, we tabled some 60 amendments with the aim of better protecting the health of our citizens and of facilitating patient access to independent, comparative information tailored to individual needs."
"The adoption of these amendments by the Committee on the Environment meant that we could place more emphasis on patients' rights to information, rather than make it an option for the pharmaceutical industries to provide that information."
"In light of the compromise amendments reached, and given the positive changes made to the substance of the text over recent months, we have decided to withdraw our proposal to reject the texts."
"The draft report, as amended, has succeeded in counterbalancing the European Commission's initial proposals."
"Nevertheless, we shall continue to speak out against health professionals being used to distribute to their patients brochures and information that have been supplied by pharmaceutical companies without any checks by health authorities."
"Similarly, we will oppose the authorisation of industrial campaigns, especially information campaigns, in relation to vaccines."
"Information must not be freely distributed by pharmaceutical companies."
"Experience shows that we must be very vigilant - and what happened with the Mediator medicinal products shows, in fact, just how vigilant we must be - and make sure that we strike a balance, as we have sought to do with this draft report."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, on behalf of my group's shadow rapporteur, I would like to congratulate Mr Fjellner for the great work accomplished."
"The ALDE Group welcomes this report, which finally sets a clear framework for the provision of information to patients on medicinal products."
"Patients need to be informed objectively and there needs to be a clear barrier between information and advertising."
"Therefore, information about prescription medicines should be regulated strictly."
"Special attention has also been given to new media - mainly Internet websites - defining clear safeguards, developing mechanisms for the monitoring of contents and ensuring specific provision for proper enforcement."
"I would also like to make a personal point with regard to the materials provided to healthcare professionals for distribution to patients."
"There is no objective reason to exclude such materials from the provision covering other contents, especially when we know that doctors are the most trusted sources of information to patients."
"I will therefore personally vote against Amendment 88 and I hope coherence will guide our voting position in order to maintain the major improvement that this report would bring to the Commission proposal."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - (CS) Mr President, I would like to begin by emphasising that this is one the reports that I fully support."
"I have been campaigning throughout my career for every citizen to be put in charge of his or her own health, but this can happen only if people are properly informed"
"As Horst Schnellhardt has already mentioned here, we have been campaigning since the last legislative session for progress to be made over this standard."
"These eternal debates over the fact that we are unable to distinguish between advertising and information now seem ridiculous to me, if you will pardon the expression."
"We can all distinguish between requested information and information that is forced on us."
"We should open the door fully to all information that is requested."
"Let us not forget that we are living in a globalised world, and let us not oblige European citizens to seek out information on US websites."
"Madam President, just like Mr OuzkÃ½, I, too, have devoted my professional career as a doctor to the question of how better to inform my patients."
"However, it is customary to begin by applauding the good work of the rapporteur, and I would like to do this, although with a minor criticism which I will return to later."
"When we began negotiating this proposal, we faced two problems following the election of the new Commission."
"First, the issue had transferred to a new Commissioner, and second, we faced a problem over whether to continue the work started, or to throw away the existing document and start afresh."
"Just like most of you and Commissioner Dalli, I agreed that the original Commission proposal was not a good one, as it did not address the needs of patients and consumers."
"We therefore did not want to lose time working together on the old document."
"We agreed to reject the commercial campaign mounted by the pharmaceutical companies."
"We ruled out print media as a communications channel, and we agreed that patients had a right to know who was providing information, and that companies were responsible for all the information they disseminated."
"I am rather surprised that Mr Fjellner is again submitting to the plenary an amendment proposal which we rejected in the committee and which would be a retrograde step, contrary to the amended wording of the proposal."
"If such a proposal were to be adopted, I would find it difficult to vote for what is generally a decent document."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I agree with the rapporteur that the focus should be on patient safety and providing patients with information."
"Patients, nurses and doctors should all have access to the best possible information on a given medicinal product."
"Doctors I speak to want greater accessibility of impartial information on medicinal products, both for themselves and for patients and other professionals."
"They also want the descriptions of the preparations to be standardised, as they use the Internet predominantly to find information on the effects of medicinal products."
"Here they compare the active ingredients of the same medicine from different companies at home and abroad."
"It is therefore extremely important for pharmaceutical companies to understand their responsibility and the importance of their information being factually and technically correct and of it not being construed as advertising."
"Pharmaceutical companies must sell their products, we know that, but accountability actually increases consumers' confidence in a preparation."
"(DE) Madam President, the wellbeing of patients is key here."
"In order to cover themselves, pharmaceutical companies often include every minor side effect in package leaflets, which, of course, complicates matters greatly."
"Confused patients tend to change the dose on their own initiative or to discontinue the medication."
"Moreover, the flood of information via the Internet, some of which is reliable and some not, adds greatly to the confusion and uncertainty."
"Certified websites are a step in the right direction, but are not yet enough."
"A further priority is to make the information comprehensible even to those without medical or pharmaceutical qualifications."
"The package leaflet must be unmistakable and legible."
"The font size should be increased, particularly for older people."
"I regret to say that there are third countries that are profiting from the high level of protection in the European pharmaceutical sector."
"Both original and fake medicines are thus freely available in large quantities in Turkish bazaars."
"We therefore also need to impose obligations on these third countries in order to put an end to this black market entirely."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the directive that we are discussing is intended to harmonise the content and quality of pharmaceutical information which is accessible to all citizens of the Union."
"Whilst it stresses the right to advertise, it ultimately asserts the patient's right to information."
"We must give all European citizens the same opportunity to access information on medicinal products."
"The main objective of this directive is to make European patients more informed so that they can take a more knowledgeable approach to medicine."
"Every one of us, and especially the pharmaceutical industry, must have the same objective, which is to provide information that is accurate and useful and, at the same time, available to all citizens without distinction."
"I believe that there are two particularly important points in the directive."
"Firstly, citizens must be given the opportunity, by means of accurate information, to use medicines correctly, so that they have a more beneficial effect on their health, whilst the risks associated with their misuse are minimised."
"Secondly, accurate and effective information can increase citizens' awareness of the burden of pharmaceutical costs on public spending."
"In any case, we must be very attentive and rigorous on certain points."
"I refer, above all, to the danger of medicinal information turning into disguised advertising."
"We must avoid the risk of supposedly scientific information disguising a much less noble intention, which is to influence patients and steer them towards buying a particular medicine."
"It is therefore crucial to have effective tools to control information, especially that which patients may obtain from the Internet."
"In conclusion, I therefore hope that the Committee will provide ways to control information in such a way as to guarantee its accuracy."
"These controls should be entrusted to dedicated independent organisations so as to offer greater guarantees of impartiality."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in his address, Commissioner Dalli himself said that we must focus on the patient."
"Although the original proposal from the Commission tended rather to put the market at the centre, we have now succeeded - through a wide range of amendments that were adopted with a large majority - in putting people at the centre instead, thereby taking into account what Commissioner Dalli said."
"The right of the patient to high quality non-promotional information on the benefits and risks of prescription-only medicines was urgently needed."
"We need this regulation."
"I myself come from the world of advertising - my professional background is in advertising and PR - and I know that advertising has one aim, and that is to sell."
"Our task, however, is to provide information."
"I believe that the present report and the corresponding amendments give due consideration to our responsibility to provide information."
"Commissioner, since the costs of medicines make up a large proportion of healthcare spending, I urge you to work to ensure that patients are well informed and continue to pursue and focus on your initiatives, prevention and health promotion."
"Together, we will then be successful."
"Madam President, how often do we wonder about the side-effects of medicines we are taking?"
"How often do we wish for more information on products and illnesses?"
"This report deals with these questions and the need the public has for information."
"The change of focus from the original Council proposals was important, as was the emphasis on the patient's right to access information as opposed to the possibility of pharmaceutical companies providing information."
"This was achieved by a ban on direct consumer advertising for prescription-only medicines."
"In addition, an important issue was the recognition of the national competent authority and healthcare professionals as the main source of information."
"Again, this was achieved."
"The Information to Patients Directive sends a strong message on the rights of patients."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on tackling a difficult dossier and producing a comprehensive directive which, I hope, we will all support unitedly."
"(LT) Madam President, in the European Union, we stand for the principle of consumer, in this case, patient, awareness and are aiming for citizens to partly take responsibility for their own health."
"However, our duty as politicians is to protect patients from incorrect and misleading information."
"That is what we are doing today."
"As far as public access to information about pharmaceuticals is concerned, it would seem that the situation varies across the European Union."
"The distinction between information and advertising is becoming less clear."
"I therefore support Parliament's position which aims for a clearer definition of information and advertising."
"It is important for patients to obtain reliable objective information in their mother tongue, for it to be designed for the non-expert public, and for it to be easy to understand and access, bearing in mind the particular needs of consumers."
"As well as patients, we must protect doctors from hidden advertising as their relationship in the treatment process is particularly important."
"We are living in an age when borders are disappearing and information can move freely, just as we can ourselves."
"Therefore, we must apply certain safeguards to ensure the wellbeing of European patients."
"I therefore congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work and hope that we will all be healthier and will have easier access to information."
"(CS) Madam President, the directive on medicinal products has not been significantly amended for almost 10 years, and a revision of this directive is therefore long overdue."
"I fully support patients being fully informed and being made equal partners with doctors, sharing in decisions and also taking their share of responsibility for such decisions."
"Accessibility of information will undoubtedly play a fundamental role in this change."
"Such information clearly includes information on medicinal products, including those that are subject to medical prescription."
"Patients should have access to information on a product, and not only in printed form, but also in electronic form."
"They should have access to information that is independent, objective, comprehensive, true and accessible in an intelligible form and intelligible language."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his good work."
"I support his proposal."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Christofer Fjellner, and his shadow rapporteurs."
"Under difficult conditions, and despite battling against a severe headwind, a very good result has genuinely been achieved with this report."
"The Commission proposal has been improved considerably."
"A strict ban on advertising remains: there will be no information on the radio, television or in magazines; instead, patients must actively seek out the information."
"I base my position on the idea that patients are responsible people."
"They want to be informed, and I would very much like to help them achieve that."
"I therefore also want the patient to be at the centre of the information."
"I would like to focus on two key points."
"I myself have said in no uncertain terms - including in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - that I would like to see health portals on the Internet and similar information in printed media."
"Our citizens often look things up on the Internet, where they often come across poor and uncontrolled information."
"We must therefore counter this with an alternative: controlled information."
"Pharmacovigilance was a first success, with the adoption of drug safety portals that included the package leaflets and information on the medicines."
"However, I would like to go beyond this, Commissioner, and would have liked to have seen comprehensive Internet portals that also provide information on illnesses and prevention."
"If I have understood you correctly, you support this in principle, but perhaps have not said so in this dossier."
"I would like the Commissioner to make a clear statement as to whether he also supports this."
"I consider this to be a very, very important matter."
"(FR) Madam President, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Fjellner, on the excellent work he has been doing for several months on these two reports."
"I say this especially because we have been waiting years for this text."
"The oldest MEPs among us will remember that, back when the pharmaceutical legislation was being revised, we wanted to talk about teaching patients about medicinal products and treatments, but that, unfortunately, there was some confusion between information and advertising."
"Nowadays, information must not be allowed to be disguised advertising and, in fact, the emphasis in these reports is no longer on the right of companies to convey information but on the right of patients to access it."
"The rationale is therefore completely different, and that is why patients are the priority."
"Moreover, we say 'no' to unsolicited information, a move that will reduce the distribution channels and thus the risks of advertising."
"Patients themselves will search for the information they want, which will not be forced on them, via the radio or television, newspapers or magazines."
"That, in fact, is what makes it different from advertising."
"Some information will therefore need to be pre-vetted."
"Such pre-vetting must be carried out by national authorities, and it must allow for the creation of specialist, objective websites, and the use of specific printed materials, as Commissioner Dalli has explained."
"All the conditions are therefore in place for ensuring good quality information, objective information, information for which patients have long been waiting."
"This is why the Council absolutely must fulfil its responsibilities and agree to it, because we cannot allow just any information to be found on websites."
"We have been waiting for 10 years: 10 years for the Council to make its decision."
"(HU) Madam President, Mr Fjellner, too, deserves thanks for the report, for we have long needed a proposal for providing patients with more and better information on the prescription-only medicinal products prescribed to and used by them."
"Quality information is very important and contributes to improved healthcare conditions."
"When patients are adequately informed, they are more likely to follow the required treatment and will better understand the decisions relating to their treatment."
"What we need is not only harmonisation of European regulations."
"We must also ensure an improvement in public health through the provision of correct information."
"Pharmaceutical companies also play an important role in this."
"However, we must also make sure that there is no excessive drug consumption as a result of commercial promotion."
"There are numerous problems with the provision of information on medicines in EU Member States today."
"In some Member States, patients have difficulty accessing even the most basic information about prescribed medicines."
"This causes serious inequalities in EU healthcare."
"In addition to information available on the Internet, we need to provide guidance through traditional channels as well."
"However, our aim is not to ensure that pharmaceutical companies have the right to provide information, but to give patients the opportunity to obtain information."
"We need to distinguish between information and advertising."
"In my view, communication between patients and doctors is also important, since the primary source of information for the patient must be the physician who prescribes the medication."
"Other information channels should only serve to supplement that information."
"(CS) Madam President, I very much applaud the work of the rapporteur on regulations for improving the accessibility and quality of information on medicines for European patients."
"As a doctor, I can say that the information on product leaflets is reliable and intelligible to doctors."
"Now, it must also be written in such a way that lay persons also understand it."
"However, we are also aiming to put an end to misleading advertisements on the Internet that encourage people to buy products that not only do not cure, but may even harm patients."
"It is, however, not easy to regulate web content in a globalised digital environment."
"I would like to emphasise again that the solution is to implement as soon as possible the proposal to introduce reliability marks for safe websites."
"Only then will it be possible to ensure reliable content concerning medicines on the Internet, regardless of where in the world the website operator is based."
"Such a plan was also included in my report on consumer confidence in the digital environment."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report being discussed is extremely important, since it will enable European legislation on access to information on medicinal products to be harmonised and, above all, because it will ensure that patients obtain more information about prescription medicines."
"The posting of this information on websites must be transparent and independent."
"To ensure this, all information must be examined by the relevant national or European authorities, to prevent it from becoming disguised advertising of medicinal products, perhaps through the action of production companies."
"Finally, I call for the same attention to be given to information contained in prescription medicine brochures also."
"In this regard, I would prefer doctors or pharmacists to be the ones who provide detailed information to patients, to ensure the thorough understanding of medicine administration that is required."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that the regulation is positive, since it is aimed at providing a harmonised legislative framework with regard to non-promotional information on prescription medicines which pharmaceutical companies may communicate to the public, leaving the advertising ban unchanged."
"The motion stresses the difference between advertising and information."
"The provision of information is based on the principles of active research."
"Doctors must continue to be the main source of information on medicinal products."
"Other sources, which are understood to be complementary and which include magazines and newspapers, should be maintained."
"The central focus is the patient's right to information, with the active participation of organisations that represent citizens, particularly patients."
"We voted in favour."
"Madam President, we would all like to see patients using the existing information that is available to them."
"We need to create awareness among citizens about the use of the information currently available."
"I support colleagues here who say that we should not advertise products, and would say to the companies involved that communicating quality information to consumers is the best form of advertising, because if a product works for the citizen, then that is a clear message that it will be used where it is required."
"Of course, we need to have general practitioners communicating medical and scientific information to their patients."
"This often does not happen in the best possible way."
"Finally, we also need to be clear about how medicaments are allocated to citizens of different age groups."
"They are prescribed today with no review of the case for a year."
"This is very dangerous, and we need to have much more rigorous assessment of how patients are cared for, on a regular basis."
"Otherwise, we will have medical problems."
"Madam President, I am pleased that the Commission started by pointing out precisely the fact that access to information on medicinal products currently varies enormously throughout Europe, because we have tried very hard to ensure that everyone has good access and to harmonise this access."
"At the same time, I had a requirement of my own and that was that the information must not be worse or sparser in any particular country."
"I know that this is something that many people were concerned about in some countries, including Sweden, where, for a long time, we have had a system called Fass."
"I will now address those people directly and say that the way Parliament has voted here not only means that it is possible to retain Fass, but it is also possible for other countries to introduce similar systems."
"In other respects, of course, the rules in Europe today are rather strange in that anyone can say whatever they like about medicinal products that are subject to medical prescription except those who manufacture these medicinal products; in other words, those who should know most about them."
"I am therefore pleased that we have established that they not only have the right, they actually have a duty to disseminate certain basic information."
"They must also contribute, because after all, they are the ones sitting on a lot of the information."
"To the Commissioner I would simply like to say that I am very pleased to see that you and I seem to agree on all of the points that are key for me in this work."
"I believe that the Commission and Parliament are now in agreement."
"This puts considerable pressure on the Council to take up this matter in a constructive way and work further on it."
"To be honest, even with regard to the points in the proposal to which the Commission has stated that it has objections, I would maintain that the essence of what we want to achieve is very similar, for example, as regards printed material and the possibility of helping those countries that have constitutional problems, including Sweden, to solve them in the proposal."
"Finally, I would like simply to address those Members here who do not think that we should have an exception for doctors and the information that doctors are to provide."
"Personally, I think that a doctor who sees a clinical trial published by a company should have the right to give it to a patient if the doctor deems the information to be relevant, or that a doctor who finds a package leaflet in a language other than that Member States' official language should have the right to print out that information and give it to a patient."
"In that case, however, we must vote for the doctor himself to be able to decide and not for this directive to govern what doctors are to give to patients."
"It is always the doctors' responsibility and we should not regulate it here."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 24 November 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - Information regarding consumer products has become essential."
"Information on medicines is especially sensitive."
"One important distinction which has to be made is between information and advertisement."
"The European Parliament, in discussing this report, is making safeguards where medicines are concerned."
"One instance is that printed matter has to be submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 90 days in advance for analyses before being forwarded to consumers."
"One important element which is not being addressed is information on prices."
"During this legislature, I have insisted on the high prices of medicines in Malta when compared to the same medicines elsewhere in the European Union."
"The difference in price is not minimal but unbelievable."
"The cost of some medicines in Malta is double or even more than the cost in Europe."
"When I submitted questions to the Commission on the subject, they always indicated that this is an issue for the national government."
"I strongly believe that the EMA should not only act as a shield for consumers in relation to information on medicines, but when consumers are being blatantly overcharged for medicines and national governments are unable to tackle the issue, the EMA should have the ability to address the issue."
"in writing. - I welcome the provisions in the report on the information on medicinal products which emphasise the right of consumers to information."
"Regarding this, I would like to draw your attention to the online public consultation launched by the EC in connection with forthcoming amendments to the Tobacco Products Directive."
"Undoubtedly, this initiative is praiseworthy and I support it."
"But I would like to see the position of Parliament and the Council because, since I have familiarised myself with the proposals, I define some as extreme, unreasonable and, to some extent, I am even surprised at their inclusion for discussion."
"I mean some of the proposed options such as the introduction of simplified uniform packing without insignia, a ban on the display of products in sale and prohibiting the use of additives in the production of tobacco products."
"I believe that in drawing up new regulations, reality must be considered."
"Extreme bans and restrictive regulatory measures on tobacco should be treated with caution."
"This is a growing problem and I don't want this signal to remain without discussion."
"The Commission proposes, but what it gives us as proposals is not always the best for all Member States."
"A debate in this case is obligatory!"
"I think it is a good thing that, as a result of this proposal, the focus of the directive and the regulation has moved from drug manufacturers to patients."
"It is extremely important to raise patients' awareness of prescription drugs in order to prevent overconsumption of medicines as a result of commercial considerations."
"Unfortunately, in many Member States, it has become the norm for drug companies to lobby hard, offering a number of benefits which certainly have an influence on doctors' decisions."
"Needless to say, business interests are not always consistent with the interests of patients, and this is why the amendment to Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 are necessary in order to create a clear framework for giving out information on prescription drugs."
"A clear framework would help to promote the rational use of drugs and would be in the interest of patients."
"There should certainly be clearer distinctions made between advertising and information, even though direct advertising of prescription drugs to consumers will remain prohibited under the relevant proposals."
"in writing. - The Environment Committee has made some important improvements to the Commission's proposal which, in its original form, would not have prevented all forms of advertising of prescription drugs directly to patients."
"Prescription medicines are not like ordinary consumer goods."
"They should be supplied by clinical experts, not marketed like cars or cosmetics."
"So I welcome the continued ban on advertising of prescription medicines on television, radio, and in the print media."
"Healthcare professionals remain the most trusted source of information about medicines."
"So I cannot support the rapporteur's amendment which would allow healthcare professionals to distribute additional, unapproved material from the pharmaceutical companies directly to patients."
"This would represent a clear opportunity to advertise, something which we want to avoid and which would be inconsistent with our position against direct advertising to patients."
"It is especially inappropriate because the material directly from the pharmaceutical company would, in the patient's eyes, carry the legitimacy of the doctor distributing it."
"On the whole, the report represents improvements for patients compared to the Commission proposal, and we should not undermine these improvements by allowing pharmaceutical companies to advertise directly to patients in the doctor's surgery."
"Restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Jill Evans, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (recast) - C6-0471/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I would first of all like to thank all of my colleagues who have made this first reading agreement possible - in particular, of course, all of the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and both the Spanish and Belgian Presidencies, as well as the Environment Committee and the group staff and assistants."
"We managed to reach agreement following a lot of hard but constructive work, including some very difficult compromises."
"To put this debate into its proper context, over 9 million tonnes of electrical and electronic equipment is sold every year in the European Union."
"Most of this is large household appliances and IT and telecommunication equipment."
"As this market continues to grow, it has also become the fastest-growing waste stream in the EU, estimated to rise to a huge 12.3 million tonnes by 2020."
"It is a very complex waste stream that includes several hazardous substances."
"The waste hierarchy makes prevention of waste the first priority, which means substituting hazardous substances in products which prevent recycling or pose a risk to health and the environment when undergoing waste treatment."
"The Commission estimates that the current RoHS Directive has led to a reduction of 100 000 tonnes of certain heavy metals and two groups of brominated flame retardants from going into the waste stream and potentially entering the environment."
"RoHS has set a global standard, but there was a need for more clarity, so we had a great responsibility with this recast to ensure that a clearer and more ambitious law was adopted."
"I believe that we have improved the current directive in a number of ways."
"It now has a clear methodology, with criteria for deciding on new restrictions, complementary to and independent of REACH."
"The scope has been extended to include all electrical and electronic equipment within eight years, unless it is specifically excluded."
"There will be a review for additional exclusions within three years, together with an examination of three phthalates and one brominated flame retardant identified as priority."
"Time-limited exemptions can be granted on the basis of clear criteria and application deadlines."
"Nanomaterials will be looked at specifically in future reviews of restrictions."
"Given my ambitions for this report, Members will not be surprised that I am not completely satisfied with the final outcome."
"The RoHS Directive was designed to address the specific problems of a specific waste stream and I think that we have missed an opportunity to move it forward substantially by adding further restrictions."
"However, we have kept its identity and strengthened the Commission proposal in many ways."
"On correlation tables, my group supports making this obligatory for Member States, but this is a horizontal issue that affects all European legislation and cannot be resolved in this one file."
"To help find a solution, I proposed in Amendment 105 that we adopt a declaration calling on the Commission to report on the current practice of Member States in providing correlation tables and how it affects the Commission's work instead of insisting on mandatory correlation tables."
"This will give us a much clearer picture for the future debate."
"In summary, we managed to strengthen a rather vague and unambitious proposal into a new RoHS which will deliver a higher level of protection for human health and the environment now and in the near future."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, Mr PotoÄnik, the Commissioner responsible for this file, is here with me, but unfortunately he has to remain silent because of a problem with his throat."
"I know that he has been working on this file for a long time, so I will do my best to be his voice."
"We stand on the threshold of a first-reading agreement on the recast of the directive on the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment - the RoHS agreement."
"We would not have reached this point if it were not for the hard work of the European Parliament on this important dossier."
"I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Jillian Evans, as well as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for the excellent work carried out on this proposal."
"RoHS has been a successful piece of legislation since it was adopted in 2003."
"It has prevented thousands of tonnes of banned substances from being thrown away and potentially released into the environment."
"It has brought about important changes in the design of electronic products in the European Union and worldwide."
"Other countries, including the EU's major trading partners, have followed the EU's example and brought in similar legislation."
"We use enormous and increasing amounts of electronic equipment, which contain a lot of metal resources."
"A computer, for example, contains over 60 raw materials."
"On average, each EU citizen produces 25 kg of electronic waste every year."
"This law will ensure that electronic products are freed from many hazardous substances and will make this large waste stream easier to recycle."
"This law therefore also helps make the EU more resource-efficient, in line with our Europe 2020 strategy."
"However, industry and Member States alike have reported the risk of inadequate or inefficient implementation and enforcement of the directive."
"The status quo is insufficient, not only in terms of protection of the environment, but also in terms of creating a level playing field within the EU."
"Therefore, it is important that this law be clarified and streamlined."
"The key element for the Commission is to ensure alignment with REACH, but real environmental benefits only arise when a law is properly implemented and enforced at national level."
"I hope that the introduction of the common definitions and assessment tools of the new legislative framework for the marketing of products in this law will significantly improve this."
"In addition, the directive's environmental ambition is improved through the extension of the product coverage, first by the two new categories - medical devices and monitoring and control instruments - and, in eight years, to all electronic products."
"Further extensions to the scope of this law will further increase the environmental benefits, but economic operators should, of course, have sufficient time to adapt, and all scope changes should be based on solid information."
"The Commission will therefore review the scope changes as regards the current law, which have not yet been subject to impact assessments."
"The Commission would therefore like to clarify the issue by making two statements."
"First, on the scope, the Commission interprets that it follows from Article 2(1a) that during the transitional period of eight years, Member States are obliged to allow electrical and electronic equipment that was outside the scope of Directive 2002/95/EC, but which would be covered by the new directive, to continue to be made available on their market."
"Second, concerning the review pursuant to Article 19, the Commission intends to undertake, no later than three years after the entry into force of this directive, an impact assessment focusing on the changes in scope."
"This review may result in the Commission making a legislative proposal in line with its right of legislative initiative in the treaties."
"We would also like to make the following declarations as regards nanomaterials."
"We note that work towards a common definition on nanomaterials is still ongoing within the Commission."
"We intend to adopt a recommendation on such a common definition for all legislative sectors in the near future."
"The Commission considers that the RoHS provision covered different forms, including nanoforms, of the substances which are currently banned, and those which, in the future, will be subject to a priority review under RoHS."
"Finally, the Commission also regrets the lack of support for the provision, including in the Commission proposal, making the establishment of correlation tables obligatory."
"The Commission accepted the substitution of the obligatory provision by a recital encouraging Member States to follow this practice in order to facilitate a first-reading agreement, but it states that this should not be seen to be a precedent."
"We will continue to work with the colegislators in an effort to find a horizontal solution to this horizontal institutional issue."
"The Commission can accept the compromise package in order to reach an agreement on this directive at first reading."
"I would encourage Parliament to adopt the same position."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (PL) Madam President, to begin, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Evans, for her excellent work in preparing the report."
"Without her commitment and determination, achieving a compromise between the political groups and the institutions at first reading would have been impossible."
"The RoHS Directive belongs to those legislative acts which place the environment and sustainable development on the same footing as the uninterrupted movement of goods."
"Her efforts in the field of environmental protection have, to date, led to a spectacular placing of limits on heavy metals in the waste stream of electrical and electronic equipment and the appearance of technological innovations."
"Our priority during work on the review of the RoHS Directive was to raise safety standards for electrical appliances and electronic gadgets for sale in the European Union."
"The new rules will require all manufacturers of electrical and electronic equipment to use substances which have been tested and which are safe for health and the environment."
"The open scope of the directive will have a positive influence on the harmonisation of the internal common market and the movement of goods, and will give European entrepreneurs legal certainty."
"I believe the negotiated compromise is a good one, and that it is beneficial in terms of environmental protection and the removal of toxic substances from equipment and waste products."
"On the other hand, the amended RoHS Directive gives industry and entrepreneurs the necessary timeframe in which to introduce changes and to make the adaptations required."
"The proposed methodology for determining the substances intended for priority review is based on REACH, and also brings legal coherence and consistency to European Union legislation."
"Madam President, I hope that our Commissioner gets his voice back again, because we need a voice at the climate conference in CancÃºn."
"I had been rather surprised that Mrs Damanaki was speaking here on the revision of the hazardous substances directive after also speaking on the fisheries revisions; thank you for stepping into the breach."
"Parliament has not got everything that it wanted."
"Annex 3 has been dropped, which we regret."
"However, we will continue to keep an eye on these substances and when the revision takes place in three years' time, you will have to come back to this House with your impact assessments and provide evidence of the problems that exist there on a substance-by-substance basis."
"We also have a considerable number of exemptions, so that it rather resembles a Swiss cheese."
"We also need to check here the gaps and shortcomings that exist as regards human health and the environment."
"I will simply say that solar panels were highly controversial."
"We want to keep cadmium out of the environment, but these panels put 100 000 tonnes of cadmium into the environment."
"That is something we will have to watch carefully."
"I am pleased that the Commission has made some concessions with its four statements, so for now, we will take what progress has been made in 2010 and we will meet again in three years' time for the revision."
"Naturally, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs."
"Madam President, Commissioner, with this directive, we have before us legislation that has come about surprisingly quickly. I am very surprised that we have reached a compromise already which I and my group - and I expressly underline that - consider acceptable."
"When all is said and done, this piece of legislation has had a very difficult passage through Parliament."
"We expanded its scope, only to restrict it again straight away."
"We have quite incidentally attempted to declare certain substances highly dangerous; perhaps we should ask ourselves whether this legislation is really the right forum for such a debate."
"Personally, I did not think it a good idea to include PVC and nanomaterials in a directive on 'hazardous substances'."
"I therefore think it sensible that this is no longer the case in the compromise."
"The previous speaker has just said so already, but it really is remarkable that we consider each gram of polluting substances so carefully and are then sometimes very irrational in our debates."
"Apparently, there are industries in Europe which we are ring-fencing for political reasons."
"This seems to be the case for enterprises in the renewable energy sector."
"The fact that we instantly exempt them completely from the scope of this legislation by saying that we have to put up with environmental pollution for the sake of climate protection and our objectives in the area of renewable energy is incomprehensible."
"It does not add up."
"I only hope that we do not do the same thing in the case of electronic waste - the decision on which is also imminent here - because that would be even more astonishing."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I would like to add my thanks to the rapporteur and her staff."
"After very long negotiations, we have an agreement that my group can sign up to."
"However, I do want to take this opportunity to mention a couple of areas."
"This recast was intended to improve matters."
"By definition, I think that is what a recast should do."
"It was intended to simplify the requirements and demands on manufacturers."
"Looking at the result, it seems to me to be in many ways one step forward and two back."
"I welcome the removal of Annex III, which effectively created a blacklist for many substances, but I regret the inability to agree on the availability as a criterion."
"That took a great deal of discussion."
"Secondly, it was intended to create legal certainty."
"I have to mention the opening of the scope here."
"Right from the beginning, I argued that it would create uncertainty and simply cause new demands for exemptions and exceptions."
"It seemed to me that, at the very least, we required a full impact assessment from the Commission before agreeing to this."
"I have not changed my mind, but I accept that I have lost the argument."
"The checks and balances now being written into the regulations are, I believe, going to lead to a number of challenges, and I welcome the Commission's commitment to look at this after it is included."
"But it would, in my view, have been better to have done this before."
"I wonder how this opening of the scope has actually advanced legal certainty and clarity."
"Finally, I would also like to mention the real danger of over-regulation."
"In voting for the RoHS recast, we are, in effect, continuing a dual tracking of regulation and EU approval for chemical - hazardous - substances."
"We have the REACH regulations in place, and their implementation is, as we heard at committee recently, evolving satisfactorily."
"At some point soon, we will have to grasp the nettle and let the REACH regime lead, as it was intended to."
"I look forward to the Commission taking this point on board."
"Madam President, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, who has done a good job and salvaged what was possible in the face of great resistance from the Council and the majority here in Parliament."
"One major success of the new version is the open scope."
"This approach is exemplary and I am pleased that we were able to agree on it."
"On the negative side is the fact that the list of six substances that were already banned has not been expanded to include substances such as chlorinated and brominated flame retardants, phthalates and PVC."
"Although there is sufficient evidence of the risk to health that these substances present, they will not be banned in 2011 when the new version is in force."
"Certain leading electronics manufacturers have been placing products such as mobile phones, televisions and laptops that do not contain these pollutants on the market on a voluntary basis for a number of years, and without any great increase in costs."
"We have passed up a great opportunity here to make the growing electrical and electronics industry a little more environmentally friendly."
"Leading manufacturers are showing us the way."
"Instead of supporting these manufacturers with good initiatives, however, the EU is behind the times."
"It is the poor of this world that will suffer as a result."
"After all, every year, we dump millions of tonnes of toxic electrical and electronic waste on them."
"The poor cannot afford to pay for lobbyists in the European Union."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we opposed the proposal for a directive in committee because the rapporteur had radically changed the Commission's proposal in a restrictive way by expanding its scope; proposing the gradual phase-out of a further 33 substances in Annex III, including brominated and chlorinated flame retardants, as well as PVC and its additives; limiting the scope for exemptions and the time taken to adjust; and introducing restrictive regulations for nanomaterials."
"Had this House voted in favour of this decision, which is not supported by sufficient scientific evidence, it would have caused very serious damage to the economy, with major repercussions for unemployment."
"Fortunately, thanks to a series of trialogues in which I participated as shadow rapporteur, a more than satisfactory compromise has been reached, with a commitment to conduct an audit and a possible review within three years."
"Another complex subject was the detailed definition of nanomaterials, which has been suspended, pending a proposal by the Commission."
"The text, as arising from the trialogues, can be supported and adopted."
"(DE) Madam President, our heartfelt thanks go to the rapporteur."
"The directive on electrical and electronic equipment is highly controversial."
"There were great differences of opinion regarding various aspects."
"I am therefore pleased that agreement has been reached and at what I regard as the good result of the trialogue negotiations."
"I would specifically like to reiterate two points."
"One is the question of the scope."
"What equipment should the directive actually cover?"
"There is one thing that we must not forget: originally, it was meant to cover domestic appliances - in other words, white goods."
"The open scope now includes many new product groups, which would also have encompassed technologies for renewable energy."
"I must point out that this directive actually had a quite different objective."
"Naturally, much stricter and higher standards of protection need to be applied in the case of domestic appliances than in the case of technologies such as those that are uninstalled, recycled, etc. by specialist personnel."
"That is why I, in turn, advocated the exemption of renewable energies."
"I was not in favour of expanding the scope, but then I saw that a majority was moving in that direction."
"I think it would have been counterproductive to include renewable energy in this directive."
"It would have resulted in a competitive disadvantage and therefore I think it is the right decision."
"Then I would like to say something about Annex III: I would have had concerns about including a further 37 substances as priority substances when there is no real justification on health grounds for a future ban on these."
"I think that would be a panic measure, and that is why I think the decision made is the right one and am pleased about this aspect of the result too."
"(NL) Madam President, let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur."
"Mrs Evans has a remarkable determination, thanks to which we can today reach a compromise that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (the S&D Group) can endorse."
"I am saying 'can endorse' because a number of significant improvements have been made to this very important legislation."
"These improvements concern the expansion of open application areas, though we would have preferred them to be introduced more quickly."
"A further result of the improvements is that we still have a separate, independent directive - independent of REACH - obviously with the necessary coordination between the two."
"Thirdly, and I personally find this extremely important, thanks to these improvements, we have a good methodology, which Parliament has had difficulty negotiating, which should ensure that substances come under review again, so that we can see what their possible effects may be."
"On top of that, there are a number of substances (HBCDD) - which I have to look up on my paper here - one of the most commonly used and most controversial brominated flame retardants and three important phthalates - that should be addressed as a matter of priority."
"Naturally, action is also being taken on nanomaterials."
"We would have wanted to go much further, but we are happy that the Commission will, nonetheless, issue a statement."
"That is very important."
"Would we have wanted to go further?"
"Yes, of course, we are unhappy with some aspects."
"Obviously, our group would have liked some additional substances to be banned, the review to happen more quickly and there to be fewer exemptions."
"As far as the latter is concerned, I really must come back to solar panels for a moment."
"The S&D Group was the only group to oppose to the end the totally mistaken idea that solar panels should be kept outside the scope."
"A special lobby has emerged around this issue, and completely unjustifiably so, if you ask me, because that will allow cadmium, a substance which has been banned since 2003, to remain in circulation for another ten years at least."
"I find that particularly unfortunate, especially for a sector that should undoubtedly be taking a lead in this regard."
"Nevertheless, the S&D Group will be pleased to support this compromise."
"I only hope that the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group do not have the wrong dossier in front of them, because I have not seen from them much involvement in the trialogues."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the recast version of the directive should help improve protection for the consumer and environment alike."
"I believe we have achieved this because we have established a realistic framework that is based on the actual risks to consumers and the environment and that offers businesses legal certainty for investments and innovations."
"This is very important for small and medium-sized businesses carrying out research in specific areas."
"It is comforting to know that we have been able to agree risk-appropriate guidelines in relation to this important topic and, in this regard, I would also like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs."
"We have heard several speakers express their regret that the panels have been dropped."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are not talking about cadmium here, but about cadmium telluride."
"The issues at stake here are innovation and investment."
"Indeed, we need to consider these questions separately."
"The devices in question are not electrical appliances, but rather equipment for generating electricity."
"This is a very significant distinction."
"We cannot take a catch-all approach, saying 'These are all poisonous substances'."
"After all, for example, my own body contains a certain amount of sulphur."
"Now, sulphur is not something I would readily choose to ingest."
"However, things are quite different when we are dealing with chemical compounds."
"That is why I am pleased that we have finally managed to put the question of PVC behind us."
"The businesses that manufacture PVC have done a lot of research in the last few years."
"One only has to look at the latest developments to realise what has been going on in the world."
"We do not need to revisit a debate that is already ten years old."
"I am satisfied with the version now before us."
"I am certain it will enable us to achieve great benefits to the environment and consumer, as well as promoting innovation."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, we have witnessed considerable attempts by Community institutions to ensure that the production, use and disposal of electronic products better protect the environment and human health."
"The RoHS Directive is a key element of this policy."
"Compliance with the directives is certainly a challenge and a burden for businesses, but it is also an opportunity."
"Indeed, the ability to supply less polluting products is a very important distinguishing factor for our businesses, so much so that it can be classed as a real competitive advantage."
"Businesses must not regard the regulations and the provisions in the directive simply as obligations designed to penalise them, but as opportunities to improve business processes and product quality."
"Nonetheless, some exemptions have been deemed necessary - some because of the current serious economic crisis, others because they are the subject of a subsequent and specific directive."
"This is the case for nanomaterials, the space and safety sectors, fixed installations, means of transport and self-propelled machinery, human-implantable medical devices, photovoltaic panels and equipment intended for research and development applications."
"In conclusion, I would take this opportunity to express my desire for greater consistency between the RoHS Directive and the REACH regulation, with any risk of confusion or overlap avoided, because businesses and operators need clear and definite rules."
"(DE) Madam President, I believe that the fundamental intention of this directive should be endorsed."
"The committee has finally faced up to its responsibilities and has improved significantly on the Commission's proposal."
"Nonetheless, there are a couple of issues that still need to be discussed."
"Firstly, we need to remember the international dimension in all that we do."
"After all, what use is it if the European Union remains unblemished, but the importing of hazardous substances is still permitted."
"Secondly, small and medium-sized companies must be able to cope with our regulations and, above all, the associated bureaucratic effort involved."
"Thirdly, I assume that the process launched will be dynamic rather than static in nature, which is why this problem will need to be brought before the European Parliament at regular intervals."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioners, although I believe this is just a small step, at least it is a step in the right direction."
"At least the tabled amendment manages to encompass all the exceptions foreseen."
"I believe that this will also provide some important guidance for the business sector."
"However, what is particularly important in respect of these guidelines is that consumers should be kept informed."
"I believe it will continue to be very important in the future that consumers should know about the potential environmental pollutants that they may be buying when they purchase electronics or electrical appliances."
"This is the only way to ensure that the correct procedures will be followed with our next directive, namely, in relation to the disposal of these devices."
"It is important for the Commission and the Member States to supply this information now, because a transition period of eight years really is a very, very long time."
"(SK) Madam President, in advanced industrialised countries, the lifecycle of electrical and electronic equipment is constantly shrinking."
"The replacement rate of this equipment is therefore accelerating, with the result that waste from electrical and electronic equipment is becoming an ever greater environmental burden."
"It is a form of waste that is complex and very often contains hazardous substances which cannot yet be removed in a satisfactory way."
"It is therefore appropriate to consider the possible replacement of these substances at the electrical and electronic equipment manufacturing stage."
"According to the information available, our gradual aim should be to find, in particular, harmless substitutes for halogen flame retardants, or for cheap and widely-used PVC."
"However, in the case of PVC in particular, I think it will be necessary to take a very sensitive approach to finding the right compromise between the objective requirements of environmental protection and the interests of the manufacturing sector."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable Members of Parliament, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur again for her hard work, owing to which an agreement appears to be emerging from Parliament."
"This is very important."
"So we now have a package of rules set out by Parliament thanks to which Member States can ensure that electronic products placed on the European markets are free of certain hazardous substances."
"This proposal was a compromise, and we all know that compromises lead to compromises."
"This is obvious, so it is also obvious that Parliament, the Commission and everybody involved has shown a great deal of goodwill."
"The result is something that the majority of us can support."
"The Commission has a lot to say on this issue."
"We would have liked the compromise text and scope to be clearer with regard to the obligations of the Member States and the economic operators within the eight-year transition period."
"The statements the Commission has made on the scope outline the way we think the compromise text should be interpreted with regard to the scope."
"This is why I would like to ensure that these statements are included in Parliament's record."
"We nevertheless take very seriously our obligations to make an impact assessment of all scope changes as compared to the current directive, and we will start working on this as soon as the revised directive enters into force."
"On enforcement, we find that the provisions on conformity assessment and marking are going to make a difference, as they set clear obligations both on how economic operators show that their products are compliant and on how Member States are supposed to verify compliance."
"So this is not the end of our work."
"I would like to thank you all for your contributions and your suggestions."
"The Commission will take them on board."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, first, I would like to thank all my colleagues for their comments."
"It will be clear to anybody listening to this debate just what differences there were between the groups and what a difficult process this has sometimes been."
"But we have the support of all the groups, and I very much hope and trust that in the vote on Wednesday, we will see that reflected."
"I am also very pleased to hear that the Commission is committed to this directive, since the future of the directive itself will lie almost entirely in the hands of the Commission should the text be adopted on Wednesday."
"We will have no further codecision powers and, in future, the Commission would review the scope and the future restrictions."
"So I would call on the Commission to prioritise that view of the future restrictions so that we can further clean up this very important waste stream, which still creates so many problems for human health and the environment."
"As we have heard colleagues saying tonight, prevention is better than cure and there are far more problem substances than those heavy metals and brominated flame retardants which are restricted under the current RoHS Directive."
"There is also plenty of evidence of the need for future restrictions."
"This debate has, of course, been followed with interest by a great many people, including industry and NGOs."
"I believe that in this final compromise. we have remained true to the original aims of RoHS, and that we will have a more effective piece of legislation should Parliament vote in favour on Wednesday."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 24 November 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"According to recent data, 9.3 million tonnes of electrical and electronic equipment, consisting mainly of large household appliances and IT and telecoms equipment, are sold each year in the European Union."
"With the expansion of the market and the shortening of innovation cycles, equipment is replaced more frequently, thereby adding to the amount of waste electrical and electronic equipment."
"It is estimated that such waste will reach 12.3 million tonnes by 2020."
"The RoHS Directive, adopted in 2003, was intended to gradually eliminate a first series of hazardous substances, and it has allowed for a reduction in the amount of substances which are disposed of and potentially released into the environment."
"The review of this directive has been undertaken with the aim of introducing stricter regulations in relation to the restriction of hazardous substances."
"I believe that the compromise package, which was achieved following long negotiations between the Council and Parliament, represents an important step in the direction of greater clarity and simplification of the directive."
"One aspect of regulation that is particularly important is the exclusion from the scope of the directive of those substances which would have been banned without any scientific evidence, thus damaging the numerous businesses which operate in the market."
"Given how important the review of this directive is, we must bear in mind that its main aim is to provide for stricter and more rigorous regulations on restricting the use of hazardous substances."
"Now, I believe that this compromise package represents significant progress towards greater clarity and simplification of the RoHS Directive."
"Of the many aspects which are to be taken into consideration for the purpose of regulation, I would like to draw particular attention to the exclusion from the scope of the directive of those substances - such as PVC and nanomaterials - which would have faced a ban on their production."
"Not only would the ban be enforced without any objective scientific evidence; it would also harm technological progress associated with the production of such materials."
"For this reason, all in all, we can be satisfied with the agreement that has been negotiated."
"On the one hand, this agreement strengthens environmental protection needs, by banning substances which are deemed to be hazardous following reliable scientific tests; on the other hand, however, it prevents other materials, the risks of which have not been scientifically proven, from being blacklisted to the detriment of producers and researchers, but, above all, to the detriment of consumers."
"Renewables have the aim of helping to protect the environment."
"It is entirely contrary to their aim to create new hazards for the environment and for human health."
"The RoHS Directive and the Council Resolution of 28 January 1988 on a Community action programme to combat environmental pollution by cadmium are principally targeted against the use of cadmium, as Europe is a region particularly at risk from this cumulative carcinogenic poison."
"I would like to express my fundamental opposition to amendment No 12."
"This proposal excludes photovoltaic panels from the scope of the RoHS Directive."
"However, this exclusion unfortunately does not have the effect of supporting solar technologies."
"In fact, it legalises the production of cells based on tellurides of cadmium."
"CdTe cells enable producers to achieve higher profits than is the case with silicon cells."
"The approval of this proposal therefore represents support for the production of CdTe cells at the expense of silicon cells, which have a limitless supply of raw materials and do not contain toxic materials."
"The situation is all the more serious for the fact that if there is an exemption from the RoHS Directive for photovoltaic cells, it will not be possible to review and reassess the decision for a number of years."
"Research into non-toxic photovoltaic technologies will be accelerated only if producers of solar panels have to comply with the requirements of the RoHS Directive now, just like everyone else."
"Revision of the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment poses a particular challenge."
"However, a recast is urgently needed in order to eradicate uncertainties in respect of the scope, the lack of clarity of the legal provisions and definitions, as well as the differences between Member States and potential procedural overlaps with other EU legal acts, for example, REACH."
"The Commission's original proposal was tailored far too much to large enterprises."
"The economic capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises is taken into greater consideration in the current version."
"After all, these small and medium-sized enterprises form the backbone of European competitiveness."
"The derogation procedure and the relevant deadlines for a Commission decision have also been set out clearly."
"The requirement laid down to review the directive within 10 years in order to adapt it to technological progress should also be highlighted."
"When this review is carried out, it must, in particular, take account of the availability and reliability of alternative products as well as the socio-economic impact."
"Request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity: see Minutes"
"Composition of committees and delegations: see Minutes"
"One-minute speeches (Rule 150)"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(RO) Madam President, I would like to voice my concern about the excessive politicisation of Romania's accession to the Schengen area, which I have noticed recently."
"I feel that it is unfair to mix criteria specific to justice system reform with the Schengen area accession criteria."
"Romania is prepared and meets the technical conditions, which actually must be the only criteria used as the basis for carrying out the evaluation."
"Romania is not, nor will it be, an exporter of crime."
"It cannot accept that some issues specifically affecting immigrant communities of Romanian origin should be applied to all Romanians."
"We are aware that the vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs next spring will be a political one."
"However, we believe that this vote must be based on an objective and fair evaluation and, in no way, on considerations with electoral connotations."
"(EL) Madam President, NATO's new strategic doctrine, as approved at the Lisbon Summit, ushers in a new era in NATO's efforts to meet new challenges."
"It is important in this context to recognise the unique partnership between NATO and the European Union and the need for a more cohesive approach to all aspects of European security."
"In any event, cooperation between the two organisations needs to be based on transparency, complementarity and respect for each other's independence."
"It is vital that we operate synergistically and avoid overlaps, especially in terms of political missions, as this wastes staff and energy resources for both EU and Nato Member States."
"This is crucial if we are to be efficient and make savings."
"The way in which institutional cooperation is organised between the two organisations and the creation of a reliable consultation mechanism that will promptly define the ways and means of joint action are very important issues."
"I should like to call for an in-depth debate on this subject."
"(RO) Madam President, on 28 November, early parliamentary elections are going to take place in the Republic of Moldova."
"It is well over a year since the Alliance for European Integration has been in power and significant progress has been made in reforming the Republic of Moldova's society and economy."
"The Alliance for European Integration has also shown the sincere desire to go down the path of no return towards Europe."
"In view of these efforts and progress, the European Union has supported and is supporting the Republic of Moldova both politically and financially."
"I wholeheartedly hope that the elections on Sunday will confirm once and for all the Republic of Moldova's path towards total democracy, the rule of law, an efficient market economy and, ultimately, towards the European family of which, I hope, the Republic of Moldova will become a fully fledged member in the near future."
"(EL) Madam President, I should like to complain about the miserable behaviour on the part of the secretariat of the Committee of the Regions in connection with a photography exhibition being organised by the exiled Municipality of Kyrenia, which is presently occupied by Turkish urban troops in Cyprus."
"The photographs on display graphically illustrate the destruction of ecclesiastical and other monuments belonging to Kyrenia's three-thousand year history."
"This destruction had an obvious purpose: to remove all evidence that this town was inhabited by people of Greek culture and the Christian faith."
"People who were expelled from their homes by force have managed, even though uprooted as refugees, to put roots down in Kyrenia 36 years later."
"This exhibition was due to be opened by the Secretary General of the Committee of the Regions, who ultimately failed to appear under pressure from the Turkish occupying forces, because the exhibition refers to the invasion of Cyprus by Turkey in 1974 and to the destruction of its cultural heritage by the invading forces."
"In fact, the secretariat of the Committee of the Regions asked that this exhibition be taken down."
"I condemn this unacceptable behaviour."
"Madam President, Ireland's bail-out is unlikely to be the last in the eurozone, despite protestations to the contrary."
"Despite the debt crisis plaguing the EMU, officials are keen to emphasise that Ireland's problem is different from the one seven months previously in Greece."
"Whereas with Athens, it was fiscal irresponsibility and public sector corruption, Dublin's debt is due to reckless banking."
"Portugal does not appear to suffer greatly from either, yet it is still struggling to keep its head above water, as is Spain."
"What do these countries have in common?"
"The not-fit-for-purpose single currency, founded upon idealistic ideology and not economic sense."
"The old adage about putting all your eggs in one basket rings true."
"Which are Europe's most prosperous countries?"
"That would be Norway and Switzerland."
"They control their own resources and economies, yet still trade with their EU neighbours, knowing they can cast their nets elsewhere if the EU drags the whole project into oblivion."
"A rescue of Portugal would push the combined bill to the EUR 300 billion mark, exhausting the eurozone's entire capital."
"Surely the only reasonable choice left is EU-thanasia."
"(DE) Madam President, I would also like to say a few words about Ireland."
"Spiegel Online writes 'The Celtic Tiger has been taken into intensive care'."
"We need to ask why is this the case?"
"There can be little doubt that the roots of the financial crisis lie in our monetary system, in other words, the way in which money is generated."
"Private commercial banks pump incredible amounts of money into the system."
"This promotes speculation, fuels inflation and, finally, leads to massive debt among those involved."
"Consequently, we are faced with a systemic crisis that cannot be resolved by investing billions in a ramshackle banking system, even if we do so by diverting funds to the Irish economy."
"What we need is a real form of money creation."
"We need to return the generation of money to the public sector."
"This would enable us to pour hundreds of billions back into European economies."
"Moreover, the public creation of money would be compatible with a free market economy."
"However, such massive decisions would require courage and strength from our politicians."
"It goes without saying that the banks cannot be allowed to lead Parliament on a merry dance any longer."
"(HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, the European Parliament cannot fail to mention the 95th anniversary of the Armenian genocide in Turkey."
"In keeping with its decision of 18 June 1987, the European Parliament must remember the massacre of the 1.5 to 2.75 million innocent civilians, and condemn without reservation, by the same criteria as those applied to the Holocaust and the Communist genocides, the mass crimes against humanity committed by the Ottoman Empire in 1915 against the Armenian minority and Christian community."
"To date, a total of 22 states have recognised the historical fact of the anti-Armenian holocaust."
"It is regrettable that Mr Morten Messerschmidt's written report on this matter this year did not ultimately receive the necessary support."
"I hereby wish to suggest that President Jerzy Buzek take the initiative to have the Armenian genocide unanimously recognised by all EU Member States and make the denial of this fact a punishable offence, and furthermore, that this issue be made a compulsory item on the agenda of the accession talks with Turkey"
"(RO) Madam President, ninety-one per cent of young people aged between 18 and 27 think that the country's economic situation has taken a turn for the worse."
"Only 33% of young people do not want to leave Romania."
"Due to its policy of cuts, the current government in Bucharest is encouraging the brain drain abroad."
"Every month we find that young people sent by the Romanian Government for training provided through the programme initiated by the social democrats in 2004 are released by the administration or a job cannot be found for them, even though they have all the experience and desire required to make an effective contribution to the system."
"I support labour market mobility, but the government in Bucharest must create new jobs which will also benefit from these young people's expertise."
"I wish to pass on all our support to Romanian students and student associations, such as the League of Romanian Students Abroad."
"(ES) Madam President, the fishing boats that fish in the Indian Ocean are suffering a wave of pirate attacks."
"In the last two weeks, there have been ten attacks on the Intertuna III, the Demiku, the Elai Alai, the Playa de Anzoras, the Albacan, the Erroxape, the Campolibre Alai and the Playa de Aritzatxu."
"The attacks are happening increasingly far from the coast, because the pirates are using boats that they have hijacked as supply boats to improve their logistics."
"Even with private security, these boats are very vulnerable."
"They report their positions and no one intercepts them."
"Coordination must improve, as the European Union Naval Force has not intervened in any of these attacks."
"We do not know how they respond to these alerts."
"The resolution that we adopted in November last year in Parliament must be complied with, and we need more involvement from the United Nations."
"More countries need to be involved with, and more resources allocated to, Operation Atalanta, along with more effective blockades of the Somali coast and more agreements with coastal states to prosecute pirates."
"Piracy has an impact on our fishing and merchant fleet, and also on the countries with whom we sign agreements, whose development or ruin also depends on the safety of fishing in that area."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to report to Parliament what has happened with regard to the exhibition 'The Promotion of Cultural Values through the Protection of the Cultural Heritage of Occupied Cyprus', held from 17 to 26 November through the Committee of the Regions."
"On 17 November, following the opening, the head of the Communication unit, Wolfgang Petzold, ordered exhibitors immediately to suspend the exhibition on the grounds that the panels depicted captions which were different from those which had been agreed."
"I had the correspondence including the request for authorisation sent to me, and I verified that there was no difference between what the office itself had authorised, and what was exhibited."
"It also emerged that the curator of the exhibition was told, by the same head of unit, to remove the terms 'occupation' and 'Turkish invasion'."
"I phoned the head of unit a number of times to clarify what took place, but neither the director in question, nor members of his staff agreed to speak with me."
"A few hours after I reported these details, the exhibition was reopened."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that what took place in the Committee of the Regions was a serious and harmful violation of the rights of an EU Member State."
"(RO) Madam President, unfortunately, Romania has become Europe's wild frontier."
"Things were bad under the Communist dictatorship, but the situation is infinitely worse under the mafia dictatorship."
"The main tentacles of the mafia 'octopus' are the justice system and police, which are blighted by the cancer of corruption."
"The perpetrators of more than 5 000 crimes committed in Romania since January 1990 remain unknown."
"Romania is a paradise for local underworld gangs protected by the justice system and police."
"However, it is also a focal point for paedophiles, con artists and the most unsophisticated foreign agents."
"It is a good thing that the Berlin Wall fell down, but it is bad that it fell down on our heads, the peoples in Eastern Europe."
"In December 1989, a few major thrill-seekers awoke Dracula from his slumber."
"Now we do not know how to get rid of him."
"(EL) Madam President, a black cloud, which is getting thicker and thicker, has been spreading over Europe recently."
"The electoral rise of extreme right-wing fanatical, xenophobic and often racist factions and parties has marked political developments in numerous Member States, even Sweden."
"It is a sign that we cannot ignore."
"The unprecedented economic crisis and the growing immigration problem are combining to form a toxic cocktail which feeds extremes and excesses."
"This is unquestionably an extremely complex problem which will be hard to resolve."
"That is why the European centre right and social democrat parties in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the socialists, have a serious responsibility and mission: to disperse the cloud before it brings a storm."
"They must exhaust the potential for agreement and coordination, so that we can take more effective action to address specific problems, such as immigration, which require a team effort."
"Here in the European Parliament, we need to take a strong new joint initiative against xenophobia and racism in crisis-ridden Europe."
"Madam President, as an Irish MEP, I am well aware that the eyes of Europe are on my country's economic woes right now."
"The crisis in my country was caused by greed - pure greed - among the political and big business elite."
"These people squandered the wealth created by an energetic and innovative population, and they must be held accountable."
"However, the crisis was also caused by lax regulation of the banking sector."
"That failure also extends to Europe."
"One should remember last July's banking stress tests, when the Commission effectively signed off on the future of the very banks in Ireland that are at the heart of the crisis."
"How could this happen?"
"I am very angry that my country has reached this point - very angry indeed."
"I very much welcome the solidarity that has been shown by our colleagues across Europe, particularly in providing finance to stabilise our economy."
"However, I do believe we are at a crossroads for the future of the EU."
"Ireland is very much a sovereign nation and any diktats from Europe about Ireland's taxation policy would, I believe, cross a dangerous line when it comes to the treatment of smaller nation states in the Union."
"Madam President, I, too, wish to speak about the current economic crisis, but from a different perspective."
"Today, we heard Jean-Claude Trichet and Olli Rehn speaking of the need for fiscal rectitude and calling on Ireland and Portugal and other countries to adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Yet as part of a Eurobarometer survey, the findings of which have emerged today, over 27 000 citizens throughout the EU and 1 000 citizens in Ireland were asked for their views as to how we should emerge from the crisis."
"To focus on just two issues, one question asked citizens to rank in order of preference how we could rapidly move out from the crisis."
"While 29% of EU citizens and one third of Irish citizens did favour reducing public spending, two thirds of EU citizens and 57% of Irish citizens favoured boosting the economy first of all, or combining both approaches."
"A question on policy priorities showed that over 50% of both EU and Irish citizens reckoned we should tackle poverty and social exclusion first."
"So there is a real divergence between those two sets of views."
"We are not responding to citizens' concerns adequately, and I think we need to review our priorities."
"Madam President, tomorrow, 23 November, is the fourth anniversary of the death in London of my constituent, Alexander Litvinenko."
"Mr Litvinenko was murdered by elements of the Russian state in an act of state-sponsored terrorism."
"The three main suspects wanted by the Metropolitan police - Andrei Lugovoi, Dmitry Kovtun and Vyacheslav Sokolenko - are still free in Russia."
"Meanwhile, Mr Litvinenko's dignified widow, Marina, is denied justice."
"So far, no coroner's court has been convened to investigate the death, as would be the usual practice in the event of such a violent death."
"I therefore take this opportunity to call on the British authorities to convene a coroner's court as soon as possible to establish and publicly state the circumstances and cause of death and formally identify those wanted in connection with the police investigations for murder."
"Mr Litvinenko was a British citizen murdered on British soil."
"This is the least that he and his family can expect or should be entitled to."
"(SK) Madam President, a week ago, the reports on the accession process in the Balkan states were published."
"It is not fair to set conditions for the start of negotiations with candidate countries for EU membership and then fail to open negotiations after their fulfilment."
"Why do we not treat Macedonia fairly?"
"Macedonia is a country where reforms are bringing good results."
"More than 80% of secondary school leavers in this country go on to university."
"They start to learn English from the age of six."
"The Commission report talks of progress in the fight against corruption, a stable government and political dialogue."
"Macedonia has fulfilled all of the Copenhagen criteria."
"It deserves a chance to start negotiations on becoming one of the Member States of the EU."
"We can talk about the unresolved issues during the negotiation process."
"A failure to do this will undermine confidence in Europe."
"(FR) Madam President, as a result of the austerity policy conducted by the Cameron government, the United Kingdom has just decided to stop funding the large tugboats designed to assist and rescue ships in the English Channel, a unilateral decision that has been condemned by the port, maritime, trading and political bodies of that area."
"The announced withdrawal of the United Kingdom could have tragic repercussions for the maritime safety of this sector, which, with more than 250 000 vessels a year, is the busiest trading route in the world."
"Over the last 10 years, nearly 300 incidents have been recorded there, and experts believe that the pre-positioning of high-powered salvage vessels has prevented a number of these incidents from turning into major accidents."
"Since maritime safety affects the safety of EU territory and the protection of the environment, emergency towing is the responsibility of the public authority, with the financial assistance of shipowners, and must not be privatised for the benefit of private towing companies."
"The European Commission therefore has a duty to take up this matter."
"Indeed, Europe must afford itself the resources to implement the major integrated maritime policy that it is officially calling for."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to advise you, citizens and associations that we have submitted Written Declaration No 0086/2010 requesting the protection of water as a public asset."
"Water is not only a common asset, but a universal human right, and the management of water services as a local public service is the basis of good government action."
"These are our guiding principles and they are the same principles which have prompted thousands of Italian citizens to support all the requests for a referendum to prevent the removal of a primary asset from the public sphere."
"Indeed, we believe that the initiative does not simply belong to those who have proposed it, as this is a battle to be fought by everyone."
"To confirm this, it should be said that the declaration was tabled together with fellow Members from the political groups of the Greens, the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats and the European Left, and is attracting broad support throughout Parliament."
"The aim is to collect signatures from at least half of the Members of Parliament, so that the declaration becomes the official position of the European Parliament and may safeguard water as a right rather than a benefit."
"(RO) Madam President, early parliamentary elections are taking place in the Republic of Moldova on Sunday."
"The elections are between the democratic and Communist forces."
"Victory for the democratic forces, currently united in the Alliance for European Integration, guarantees the continuation of the progress made during the last year - progress towards democratic government, rights and human wellbeing."
"The democratic forces must stand together both before and after the elections."
"These elections on Sunday must be free and fair, and people must have access to information."
"There must be no repeat of the violent events of April 2009."
"Democratic governments are not established through fraud, violence or fear."
"It is, of course, the Republic of Moldova's citizens voting on Sunday, not us."
"However, we in this Parliament support those bringing about democratic change."
"They have our solidarity and encouragement."
"(ES) Madam President, recently, the Church of Our Lady of Salvation in Baghdad was attacked and 58 people were killed, mainly women and children, purely because they were Christians."
"Al-Qaeda has proudly claimed responsibility for this deed."
"This is not an isolated incident, but rather the culmination of persecutions of and attacks on Christians in majority Muslim countries."
"There have been expulsions from Morocco, threats in Turkey and attacks in India and Nigeria."
"In January, six Christians were massacred at the door of a church in Cairo."
"For how long will Western democracies collude with this by remaining silent?"
"Fortunately, President Buzek has made a statement on behalf of Parliament."
"The statement by the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, condemning the attack, limited itself to condemning a terrorist act."
"Why is the motive not mentioned, in other words, the fact that they were Christians, which was the unequivocal reason behind the attack?"
"I have not heard anything from Mr Zapatero, nor have I heard anything from Prime Minister Erdogan."
"What is the point of the Alliance of Civilisations?"
"I am ashamed of our simple-mindedness and cowardice."
"I cannot help recalling the late, misunderstood Oriana Fallaci, who announced the arrival of Eurabia and was practically stoned for having the courage to condemn what was happening in this neurotic Europe."
"(BG) Madam President, education and science are a priority objective in the 2020 economic strategy."
"Whether this programme remains on paper or is translated into action on the ground depends on us."
"In order to succeed, both European institutions and Member States need to take responsibility for it."
"Instead, the Bulgarian Government is conducting a policy which runs not only counter to national, but also to European policy on scientific research and education."
"While Europe has allocated three percent to research and development until 2020, Bulgaria has only reached a modest 0.6 percent."
"After a series of failed solutions, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, an institution with more than one hundred and forty years of history, set up under the harsh conditions of Ottoman rule, which now accounts for 55 percent of scientific research in Bulgaria and is recognised all over the world, is to be liquidated."
"It has received over EUR 30 million for over 400 successful European projects."
"Despite its involvement in European institutions at political and expert level, the Bulgarian Government clearly cannot see the link between science and getting out of the crisis."
"The issue must be placed on the agenda of the Council and the Commission."
"It is not just a Bulgarian issue, because it puts the fulfilment of the strategic programme and European priorities at stake."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to the inadequate social consultations conducted by the European Commission concerning the directive on orphan works."
"Orphan works are works for which the copyright owner cannot be found."
"Last week, I organised a debate in Parliament on this topic."
"It showed how much interest there is in this field, and how many questions are being asked concerning the directive on which the Commission is currently working."
"However, the process is still shrouded in secrecy."
"Surely the experts and the bodies who are directly involved should at least know the direction in which the work is heading."
"Around 40% of our artistic output in Europe is affected by orphanhood."
"The date when the directive will be published has been changed to the first quarter of next year, so there is still some time for consultations, and we must make more of an effort to involve our citizens, including experts, in the process of creating legislation so that it really can be as good as possible."
"(DE) Madam President, the democratic participation of employees in business is one of the cornerstones of social policy in the European Union."
"For a month now, workers at the Atlas plants in Ganderkesee, Delmenhorst and Vechta have been striking day and night for precisely these rights."
"Workers are fighting to secure a collective wage agreement that will enable good, secure jobs to be preserved."
"Unfortunately, the management has refused point blank to negotiate with the Industrial Union of Metalworkers and the works council."
"During the course of the industrial dispute, employees have been extremely intimidated and pressurised by management."
"I wish to call on the management, specifically Mr Filipov, to open discussions and to return to the negotiating table."
"Democratic participation cannot be allowed to stop at the factory gates."
"A hire-and-fire system engenders fear and sows the seeds of social unrest."
"There should be no place for such systems in Europe, as they are damaging to our democracy."
"(FR) Madam President, a couple of words on the presidential elections in CÃ´te d'Ivoire, as I am head of the Union's election observation mission in that country."
"Since the start of October, we have, in fact, had some 100 observers from 26 countries deployed throughout CÃ´te d'Ivoire."
"The first round passed off quite well on 31 October."
"There was no fraud or violence."
"The announcement of the results was slightly delayed, but generally speaking, there were no major incidents."
"The second round is scheduled for next Sunday."
"It promises to be more tense, as there have already been clashes in the streets and the tone of the campaign has become aggressive, even towards our observers."
"Moreover, these observers are sometimes prevented from carrying out their work of monitoring the preparations for the campaign."
"Tempers therefore need to cool down so that voting can take place normally."
"It is extremely important to protect our observers until Sunday and beyond."
"The debate is closed."
"Public service broadcasting in the digital era: the future of the dual system (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Ivo Belet, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on public service broadcasting in the digital era: the future of the dual system."
"Madam President, good evening Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution which we hope to adopt here on Thursday sends, in my view, a very important signal, a signal which demonstrates that there is a great deal of support in this House for our typical European media model, which gives space to both commercial broadcasters, on the one hand, and public broadcasters, that is, public media companies, on the other."
"This model, Madam President, is typically European, because you will not, or only very occasionally, find it in the United States or Japan, let alone in China."
"In most Member States of the European Union, this dual media model has proved to offer the best guarantees when it comes to media pluralism, independence of editorials and freedom of the press in general."
"However, this model is, unfortunately, coming under heavy pressure in the European Union."
"That pressure is coming from various quarters."
"It is coming through the heavy cuts that competent authorities, national or regional, are facing, but there is also a great deal of pressure from private media companies on public broadcasters."
"They consider public broadcasters to be representative of unfair competition, especially on the Internet."
"As a result of this overall situation, public broadcasters in a number of Member States of the European Union are actually struggling to keep their heads above water."
"This is calling into question the delicate balance of the dual system which is being compromised."
"We have to do everything we can to ensure that our European media model remains intact in these turbulent times and that we give it a firm foundation for the future, too."
"A number of interventions are needed for that purpose and we have formulated these in the resolution."
"The first point I would like to make, and I am not sure whether this forum is aware of it, is that, at one time, all Member States of the European Union formally committed themselves to guaranteeing freedom of the press under the framework of the Council of Europe."
"That includes a clearly defined remit and funding for public broadcasting."
"Long-term funding is important."
"It is time that we, as the European Parliament, reminded all 27 Member States that they made those commitments back then and that they also have to keep to them."
"My second point is that pluralism in the media, and freedom of the press in general, are an essential part of our democracy."
"That is why we want to introduce the role of media pluralism monitor."
"That, Commissioner, is a tool developed on the Commission's initiative."
"It is a very useful tool and one that can serve as a beacon in a number of Member States, in a number of regions where media diversity and media pluralism are at risk of coming under pressure."
"Last but not least, I think that the biggest challenge for all media is to secure for themselves a presence online, a digital presence on the Internet."
"The growing nervousness about - or, we might even say, the growing hostility to - public broadcasters' initiatives on the Internet is disturbing."
"Some people in politics, in national politics in particular, and also in the media, seem to forget that clear agreements were made last year about the online activities of public broadcasters, and it is essential that they are respected."
"If we follow this line of argument, Madam President, I think that we also need to develop models which will allow search engines and Internet service providers to play their part."
"To conclude, I think that we cannot afford to stand on the sidelines any longer, otherwise we will wake up to find that Google and YouTube, and Apple too, have taken over our media landscape."
"That, of course, would be completely undesirable."
"(SK) Madam President, there is a need to take steps in the European Union to ensure balance and a plurality of views, which will be greatly helped by an equilibrium between public service and commercial media on the market."
"With regard to maintaining cultural diversity, freedom of expression and healthy competition, we must not, of course, adopt a one-size-fits-all solution, and we must therefore respect the efforts of individual Member States to address the issue of increasing the share of public service media at the national level."
"In my opinion, a balanced ratio between public service media and commercial media on the Internet as well should be a priority both for national strategies and for European media policy in the near future."
"It is also necessary to encourage interested parties to cooperate creatively in order to improve the quality of information provided on the media market, and to produce innovations in this sector."
"I would like to end by saying that media plurality and freedom is a cornerstone of democracy."
"(DE) Madam President, I am also of the opinion that the dual media system can also be a success here in Europe and that it is important that we should have public broadcasters, on the one hand, and the private channels, on the other, operating in free competition, in a free market economy."
"Unfortunately, the reality is somewhat different."
"There is evidence of a huge trend towards monopolisation, particularly in the private sector."
"We need to take steps to counteract this."
"This trend is particularly dangerous because it is happening against a background of grave economic difficulty."
"On the other hand, we have public broadcasting companies that are failing in their public service duties by allowing party spin-doctors and handlers to decide on the subject matter and content of their editorials."
"Of course, this cannot be allowed."
"Let me take the example of ORF in Austria: this broadcaster operates like a branch of the civil service, but not in terms of economic efficiency."
"There is no liberalism or pluralism in the media and no editorial freedom at present, or at least not as much as there should be."
"What can the EU do about this?"
"I am convinced that the early warning system for identifying monopolies already presented to the European Parliament some time back is a good solution to this problem."
"(CS) Madam President, I would like to make two other comments on the debate."
"The directive adopted earlier on audiovisual services improves cooperation between the supervisory bodies, and provides a high level of protection for children against inappropriate shows and advertisements."
"However, Member States are not disciplined in the way they implement it."
"For example, in my own country, it has only been in force since June."
"We also have the incomplete harmonisation of copyright law."
"We need both to make it easier to obtain cross-border licences for audiovisual works from collective authors, and to release the archive of audiovisual works of uncertain copyright in the case of so-called orphan works."
"I have confirmed that the Commission will submit new legislation next year, but it wants to restrict the legislation only to musical works and not to audiovisual works."
"I therefore call on the Commission to state whether it will correct this fundamental error, or whether we will have to correct it as Members in committees."
"This problem is dealt with by item 33 of the report."
"(SK) Madam President, I would like to begin by supporting the efforts of the rapporteur to launch a debate in the European Parliament on the media environment."
"I think this is a very useful theme, particularly in the period of digitalisation, a period when revolutionary changes are under way in this environment."
"The media environment definitely varies between the individual countries."
"There are countries where the media environment is dominated by commercial media, with public service media essentially forming just a kind of background."
"In some places, the commercial media are weaker or broken up and diffuse, so that they do not create a concentrated pressure or a concentrated media environment, and the public service media are then more able to provide more information and to influence public opinion to a greater extent."
"In any case, however, we see that political bodies often interfere in the activities of public service media in particular, just as owners interfere in the activities of commercial media, and our information and public awareness are then influenced to a considerable extent."
"In order to achieve media freedom, genuine freedom that is independent of money, whether private money or state money, it is necessary to strive hard for journalists to be free, and not subject to some form of monitoring or self-monitoring which would, in effect, oblige them to be loyal to their employers."
"In my opinion, this is the greatest problem to arise in the media in our time, and we must make changes here in the future."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission welcomes the European Parliament's report entitled 'public service broadcasting in the digital era: the future of the dual system'."
"The report is a well-balanced text as it supports the existing dual system, based on coexistence between public service broadcasters and commercial broadcasters in Europe."
"As the audiovisual media services directive recalls in one of its recitals, this coexistence is a feature that distinguishes the European audiovisual media market from others and the report fully recognises this."
"The protocol on the system of public broadcasting in the Member States, annexed to the EU treaties, recognises the Member States' freedom to define the public service remit to organise public service broadcasting and its funding, as long as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Community."
"Therefore, the Member States determine the form and conditions of funding of their public service media so long as EU State aid rules are respected."
"We agree with the main thrust of the report, i.e. that public broadcasters should be able to use the opportunities offered by digitisation and the diversification of distribution platforms, in line with the principle of technological neutrality."
"This was acknowledged in the revised communication from the Commission of 2009 on the application of State aid rules to public service broadcasting."
"We have some comments on two elements of the report in particular."
"First, regarding monitoring the Council of Europe standards, there is no EU responsibility for the political independence of public service media."
"Furthermore, EU Member States cannot give a mandate to the European Audiovisual Observatory without the agreement of the non-EU members."
"The Commission could not do so either."
"Second, the report suggests that certain Member States have failed to take any action in promoting European works in broadcasting. This is not supported by figures from the Commission's recent report on the application of the directive's provisions."
"According to that report, broadcasters across Europe are doing well overall in terms of the promotion of European programmes."
"Public service broadcasters should be at the forefront of innovation, driving the development of new formats and quality, as regards both the programme itself and technically, if they are to keep up with trends and challenges from elsewhere."
"It seems that we fully agree on these points and I look forward to cooperating with Parliament on these issues within the legal framework provided by the treaties."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 25 November 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"At the time of transition from the analogue to digital TV system, coupled with the growing importance of new media, including 3D format, we must bear in mind a number of factors in the policies which we are devising."
"Firstly, I believe that it is useful for us to take measures to facilitate the transition to the digital system, while also considering the possibility of offering vouchers or other measures to compensate the general public."
"Another important measure would be to organise traineeships for journalists and public broadcasting managers, given the sums steadily allocated to this area by the private media."
"Furthermore, I think that it is worthwhile us considering in the future the opportunity to set up a European public radio service."
"At the same time, I believe that it would be useful for public TV broadcasters in Member States to contribute programmes of European interest to the Euronews channels."
"Given not only how widespread 3D productions have become, but also the warnings issued by doctors about the impact on viewers' health, I call on the European Commission to devise urgently a study which will take into account the possible risks which 3D TV can pose to Europeans' health under current technical conditions."
"I should like, first of all, to congratulate Ivo Belet on his excellent report on this highly important subject."
"I would also like to thank him for accepting my ideas and proposals on it."
"I believe that we have come up with a well-balanced report which aims to guarantee fair competition between public and private media."
"On the strength of a long tradition, national budgets, i.e. the taxpayer, support public TV broadcasters based on the assumption that public TV stations are there only to protect the public interest, while private broadcasters are there to protect private, commercial interests."
"However, the practice in Bulgaria and in the whole of Europe has long since shown that this is not entirely true for public or for private media."
"Drawing on many years of experience in the media sector, I proposed some amendments to this report, which aims to put public and private media on an equal footing in order to enable them to provide better quality information of importance to the public."
"European citizens have the right to receive the best information both on European and on national issues."
"This requires the efforts both of public and of private media, while regulatory authorities have to make sure that they operate on an even playing field. I thank you for your attention."
"Civilian-military cooperation and the development of civilian-military capabilities (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Christian Ehler, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on civilian-military cooperation and the development of civilian-military capabilities."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at an international level, the Member States of the European Union have undertaken to make a significant contribution to civil and military crisis management capabilities throughout the world."
"However, in many cases, we simply pay lip-service to this undertaking, which is formulated several times in the Helsinki Headline Goal as well as elsewhere."
"Let me put it in black and white: 25% of the positions approved by the Member States for the European Union's currently active civil missions, such as EULEX or EUPOL, are unfilled."
"The objectives and structures for the civil and military capabilities of the European Union repeatedly formulated by the Member States could hardly be further from reality."
"That is why the European Parliament has decided to produce an own-initiative report on the development of civil and military structures and coordination in the European Union."
"Specifically: Parliament once again states in this report that the particular civil and military capabilities of the European Union are one of the most important instruments in its foreign policy and common security and defence policy."
"We have taken an unusual route in facing up to Parliament's responsibilities in the context of the Lisbon process."
"We did not start with a report, but instead began by creating the empirical basis for this report."
"We have formulated very specific proposals based on these figures, which is why we have the support of the broad majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs: on a strategic level, we have made concrete proposals for the establishment of a structure of equal partnership between the military and civilian arms of the new European External Action Service; while, on an operative level, we have resolved to establish a permanent European headquarters, to be staffed with personnel by the Member States, to deal with the issue of creating an attractive system of incentives for national experts to participate in such operations and the build-up of personnel reserves for the future."
"We have made specific proposals for the training of civil and military personnel."
"There are concrete proposals for how start-up missions are to be financed, for example, the establishment of a start-up fund according to Article 41 of the treaty."
"Proposals are on the table for the instruments of crisis management, in particular, the question of greater future cooperation between police and military forces."
"One example of this is the European policing troop."
"However, the question arises as to how these two instruments can be linked together in specific operational cases and how we can manage the issue of separating purely military and civil operations."
"We have made proposals for the future of the battle groups."
"We are calling for a new approach to this issue."
"We want to see the battle groups being financed in accordance with the Athena mechanism."
"We are calling for the further development of the capabilities of the battle groups in line with the Oslo directives, the strengthening of the ability of the battle groups to secure civil missions, and a widening of the definition of the missions of the battle groups."
"We are considering the issue of research and technology, the question of dual use, and the inclusion of civil and military missions in the security research programme as part of the European Union's research programme."
"We are dealing with concrete questions in relation to equipment and stockpiling, as well as international cooperation with the United Nations and NATO."
"Our main concern here is the avoidance of duplication, the improved use of existing structures, the question of the consolidation of shared air transport capacities and the question of the implementation of the Berlin Plus Agreements for improved cooperation between the two organisations in the event of a crisis."
"In other words, Parliament has lived up to its new tasks and obligations."
"The report was supported by a broad majority from all groups in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and we see it as an important contribution to the future establishment of civil and military structures in the European Union."
"(HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the first and most important point we must clarify is whether we consider it important for civilian and military forces to work together appropriately."
"For me personally and for my party, Jobbik - The Movement for a Better Hungary - the answer is clearly yes: we consider cooperation between civilians and military authorities to be important."
"Now, a very good example of this in Hungary was the Magyar GÃ¡rda (Hungarian Guard), which was founded in 2007 and was able to work well - if you will - with the military authorities, be that in floodwater defences, in helping the victims of the red sludge flood, in giving blood or distributing bread, in other words, in social matters."
"You may rightly ask what reward they have received - state honours or recognition perhaps?"
"They have received nothing, and instead of thanking these people for their self-sacrifice, the Hungarian Government made the baffling decision to disband the Hungarian Guard."
"For this reason, in order that we may start cooperation between civilian and military forces, we need to honour individuals who participate in organisations like the Hungarian Guard."
"People who wish to take part in such organisations out of a love for their country and nation, protecting their environment, must be allowed to work and must be valued members of society."
"(DE) Madam President, the combination of civil and military powers is nothing new."
"Take, for example, the Command Centre, which has been in place in Council for some time now."
"Military and civil information has already been collated here."
"The Situation Centre is now to move to the External Action Service."
"I think it important to emphasise above all that the European Union has gained a high profile on the international front for its civil mechanisms, something that has brought the European Union a great deal of positive recognition."
"However, I believe we need a clear separation of civil and military powers."
"At this point I would like to pick up on something that Mr Szegedi mentioned a moment ago."
"I would like to express my grave misgivings about the march organised by the Hungarian Jobbik party in Austria's Burgenland province recently, at which rifles and fixed bayonets were in evidence."
"I do not believe that this is in any way acceptable."
"I would like to express my clear opposition to such actions."
"There can be little doubt that they run contrary to the European spirit."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(HU) Madam President, I would like a very, very short answer."
"What my fellow Member says is simply a lie."
"Neither Jobbik - The Movement for a Better Hungary - nor the Hungarian Guard has ever committed any crime - anyone can easily check this out - and has never defied any law, and therefore this is simply part of neoliberal political propaganda which tries to show them in a bad light, for neither the Hungarian Guard nor members of Jobbik have ever come into any conflict with the law, and we intend to continue to act in accordance with the law."
"(DE) Madam President, I never suggested that the Jobbik party had been guilty of criminal wrongdoing."
"However, I did claim that a targeted mobilisation took place with rifles and fixed bayonets in Burgenland."
"You have not denied that this was indeed the case."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I will focus on the report, since it is an extremely useful and important report."
"I would like to thank Mr Ehrenhauser for his contribution."
"The report is useful because it rightly focuses on the key element of civil-military cooperation, which is exactly the Commission's priority."
"It deals with the main points related to the EU's comprehensive approach in crisis management."
"The establishment of the European External Action Service is the exact expression of this priority."
"The very concept of the service that the High Representative is putting in place points in the same direction as the one suggested in the report, in particular, through the inclusion of the structures of the Common Security and Defence Policy in the External Action Service."
"We fully support the development of civilian capabilities in order to have a proper balance between resources."
"The appropriate modalities for recruitment are now agreed, and appropriate expertise can be brought into the External Action Service."
"As everyone knows, this was not possible before."
"A number of points in the report have been taken into account, and specific actions have been launched."
"This relates, in particular, to fostering civil-military synergies, better usability of the EU battle groups, training, financing, and cooperation with key partners, in particular, NATO and the United Nations."
"We also support the reinforcement of relations between the EU and the United Nations."
"We have already done a lot together."
"The High Representative again met with the UN Secretary General in Lisbon last Saturday."
"The relationship between the EU and NATO is an important issue, as was illustrated just yesterday at the NATO summit in Lisbon."
"We also favour implementing all practical measures which can reinforce concrete cooperation between the EU and NATO and ensure, in particular, cooperation when both are deployed in the same theatre."
"The Commission and the High Representative herself are looking forward to working together with the European Parliament on this important issue of civil-military cooperation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 23 November 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Civil-military cooperation and the development of civil-military potential is one of the most important components of the common security and defence policy."
"Unfortunately, many aspects relating thereto remain at the planning stage."
"In discussions on the subject, Member States agree that significant resources should be provided for this."
"In reality, the plans have not been implemented and we still do not have fully formed structures."
"In view of the growing threat posed by natural disasters, terrorist acts and conflicts beyond the borders of the EU, I hope that this report will contribute to the exploitation of civil-military potential and civil-military cooperation."
"The report contains practical recommendations in this field, inter alia, with reference to the creation of civil-military structures within the European External Action Service, the use of battlegroups and the European Gendarmerie Force, optimisation of crisis management and the use of funds from the next framework programme."
"The aim of all this is to make better use of funds so that civil-military cooperation may fully materialise."
"A further significant aim is to avoid duplication of efforts during missions where NATO is participating in tandem with European forces."
"I hope that the report will be a significant incentive to start working towards the formation of effective civil-military structures."
"Baroness Ashton should ensure that the suggestions contained in the report are implemented as quickly as possible."
"The European Union must respond rapidly in crisis situations, thereby necessitating more efficient coordination of its civilian and military structures."
"Setting up a permanent EU operational headquarters, placed alongside the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability, would maximise the benefits of civil-military coordination."
"With regard to the request in the report for Member States to make available civilian capabilities in order to achieve real progress as quickly as possible, I want to stress that, on the civilian front, Romania actively contributes to fulfilling the Civilian Headline Goal 2010."
"As a result of its considerable involvement in EU civilian missions, Romania has achieved third place in the European rankings in terms of participating in such missions and contributing sound and varied expertise through its police officers, military police officers, soldiers, diplomats, judges and human rights experts."
"Romania is also at an advanced stage in the process of adopting a national civilian capabilities strategy."

"Natural disasters in the European Union"
"I shall begin with some very sad information regarding the floods in Europe."
"Yet again this year, Europe has been hit by a flood disaster."
"Recently, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and northern Italy have suffered - at the moment there is flooding in central Italy - as well as the south-west of England and several other countries."
"Perhaps, when you take the opportunity to speak, because I will open the floor in a moment, you will give other examples, too, of serious floods which have afflicted Europe."
"There have been fatalities, as well as material losses valued at many millions."
"Eight years ago, the European Union Solidarity Fund was established to help countries which have been hit by natural disasters."
"The money set aside in this fund has so far been used in 33 serious natural disasters."
"We share, today, the pain of the victims' families and of those from whom the water has taken everything they possessed."
"We know these are terrible, exceptional events in the life of every person affected."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over recent weeks, severe floods have struck several European countries, bringing the populations of the affected regions to their knees."
"Last week, four Belgian citizens lost their lives in the provinces of Waals-Brabant, Oost-Vlanderen and Henegouwen, on the border between the capital and the northern part of the country."
"As far as the authorities are concerned, it was the worst flood of the past 50 years."
"In two days, as much rain fell as normally falls in one month."
"It was so bad that the army had to intervene to evacuate the hardest hit areas."
"Similar situations arose in the western part of France, where many roads were impassable to traffic and caused gridlock to the transport system."
"Seed could not be sown in autumn due to the continual rain that prevented access to the land."
"Twenty days ago, my own country, Italy, was also hard hit in the regions of Veneto, where two deaths occurred, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Liguria and Calabria, with one fatality in each, and the province of Salerno in Campania and Tuscany, where three people died, with dozens of injured people having to be extricated from the mud and rubble and one person who is still missing in Rovigo."
"The damage amounts to more than EUR 1 billion for the most immediate work alone, to which must be added the funds necessary for structural works."
"More than 4 500 homeless, 280 municipalities and more than 500 000 people affected, farming areas devastated and 150 000 dead livestock."
"I would like to highlight two aspects."
"The first is the exceptional mobilisation of the aid machinery and the world of solidarity that sent thousands of volunteers to support the people struck by the first stage of the emergency."
"They deserve the thanks and appreciation of our institution."
"The second aspect is linked to the long-term effects that this catastrophe will trigger."
"The fabric of the European manufacturing industry is made up of small and medium-sized enterprises that have lost everything: machinery, vehicles and materials."
"The same applies to the thousands of farms that have seen their crops destroyed but also the tractors, machinery and seeds rendered useless by the mud, with stables and stock farms flooded and thousands of cattle and poultry drowned."
"These farms, which were already struggling with the economic crisis, are now destined for bankruptcy."
"Over time, the floods will lead to the destruction of the productive system, with unemployment and depletion of the affected lands."
"Europe must therefore play its part as a matter of urgency by assuring the governments of those countries affected of its willingness to mobilise the Solidarity Fund."
"Even if it means overriding the strict criteria for fund activation and even without the approval of the 2011 budget, we must respond immediately to our fellow citizens who are still experiencing, even now, the effects of such a great crisis, and who are entitled to feel that Parliament is behind them and the European Union is providing substantial support."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to show our solidarity with all of the regions hit by natural disasters, and give our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of the storms."
"2010 began with the world in shock at the scale of the tragedy caused by the disaster that struck the autonomous region of Madeira, in Portugal."
"Shortly afterwards, storm Xynthia buffeted France."
"Extreme meteorological phenomena also affected Spain, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, causing substantial damage."
"In Central Europe, summer floods are becoming increasingly frequent and devastating."
"Thousands of people have had to flee their homes in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, Poland, Italy and the United Kingdom, and numerous factories have had to cease operation."
"Every year, hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest in southern Europe are consumed by fires."
"It is thought that climate change is exacerbating the situation and that natural disasters which cause terrible damage in terms of loss of lives, environmental damage and reduced economic activity are on the rise."
"It is vital to prevent, research and properly manage the risk."
"According to the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, better urban planning in coastal zones and the preservation of ecosystems can reduce the impact of natural disasters."
"On the other hand, civil protection mechanisms should be strengthened, the EU's response instruments simplified and the rules for implementing regulations made more flexible."
"Mr President, you have spoken about the Solidarity Fund."
"It is incomprehensible that the Council has maintained the block on the new regulation on the Solidarity Fund, which was approved by Parliament."
"I would also point out that Parliament recently approved the proposal for the creation of a European Drought Observatory as a centre for knowledge, mitigation and monitoring of the effects of drought."
"Greater investment in prevention and more care in the preparation and training of personnel can also make all the difference."
"Mr President, of course, our first sympathies lie with the victims."
"In my country, four people have drowned and I hear that in other countries, too, hundreds and thousands of people have suffered enormous financial and emotional losses to their businesses and homes."
"Our first thoughts go out to them, of course."
"In recent weeks, months, even years, a large number of Member States have encountered problems with water, that is, with flooding."
"I have a question for the Commission."
"Do you think that, in assessing these events, it would be useful to bring together experts from various Member States, from various regions, and give them the opportunity to tell us what their opinions are about what has happened, so that we can get a better insight into the causes?"
"It is a very complicated matter, but, in my view, if we can get to the bottom of the causes, we will also be able to discuss remedies with those experts."
"In my view, a risk analysis of each river basin, such as those we have carried out for the environment in the Water Directive, would be appropriate."
"We also need to consult them about preventative measures."
"How can we prevent such a disaster happening again?"
"Because, we are still expecting some heavy rain and it will be concentrated in particular areas; that has, after all, been the cause of the flooding."
"Finally, if we then experience a new emergency, we will need to ensure that we are able to take better coordinated measures to improve water disposal."
"I would like to ask the Commission to bring experts together so that we can properly assess the recent disasters."
"Mr President, I, too, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, should like to offer my condolences to all the families and all the people who have been affected by these tragic floods, to all those who have lost loved ones, and to all those who have sustained material losses."
"However, I should also like to mention and thank all the fire-fighters, rescue workers and volunteers who have been very active over the last few weeks in all the affected regions."
"The victims will have to be assisted and compensated not only in the very short term, but also in the months to come."
"We will also have to come up with a consistent and innovative policy that tackles the root causes of the problem, and I propose three types of measure to the Commission."
"Firstly, we must carry out renovation and construction projects to make the soil less impermeable, because every time an industrial site, shopping centre or housing estate is built, it must be designed in such a way as to prevent the soil from becoming slightly more impermeable."
"This provision does not just apply to flood zones."
"Secondly, we must review our agricultural practices."
"Intensive agricultural policies have made the land more vulnerable to sudden changes in the weather."
"We should therefore strengthen all agri-environmental measures along these lines."
"Lastly, there is the matter of alerting and coordinating towns so that they can prepare for and deal with such incidents when they occur."
"We feel that communication and mobilisation have not been fast enough at times, and thought will no doubt have to be given to more active procedures for coordinating the dissemination of weather warnings."
"I therefore propose that the European Union should review all of its policies - prevention policies and active policies in all other areas - and should develop ones that can be of help in this matter, otherwise, when the next rather extreme weather events occur in a few months' time, we will find ourselves back here offering our condolences to the victims - to people, families and businesses."
"I believe we should avoid that, and we can do so in all of our policies."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, my group also extends its sincere condolences to those affected."
"I have very personal experience of this; indeed, it was the flooding in my own region which first brought me into contact with the European Parliament and indeed inspired me to become a Member eventually, so the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund in that event was certainly a big event for me."
"Only this week, we have had further flooding in Cornwall, which is in my region."
"My point has already been made by Mr Sterckx, but I think it bears repetition."
"I think that early warnings are important, but we all know how quickly the weather moves and how quickly the weather changes."
"I wonder if it is really a good use of money to put a lot into early warnings on weather, which are already really there."
"It is about what you do when you get the warnings."
"As Mr Sterckx has said, Europe could certainly add a great deal of value by having a situation in which we could learn from each other."
"I know in the case of Gloucestershire, where I came from, we were greatly helped after the floods by connections most particularly with Austrian regions, where they had major experience of flooding in highly elevated areas."
"We did not have that."
"I think it would be a very good idea for the Commission to focus on setting up some regional connections so that we can learn from each other about how we cope with this, because it clearly is not going to go away."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, I would like to express my sympathy for the victims and for those affected."
"All the groups in Parliament are in agreement on this."
"We also agree that we must provide aid quickly."
"A lot of sensible things have already been said."
"It is not necessary for me to repeat them, but I do fully support them."
"There is one further aspect that I would like to highlight and that is the long-term damage."
"We must not forget that many of the consequences will have a more lasting impact on the natural environment than we may currently anticipate."
"Therefore, it seems important to me for the Solidarity Fund and the measures that we are taking to be targeted at these long-term consequences of natural destruction."
"I would like to make one last point."
"We can sit here and discuss this issue, but the most important thing for us to do is to provide support, so that people can begin to organise help for themselves, because they have a better understanding of the local conditions than we do here in Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I would like to express my solidarity with all citizens affected by the flood."
"I would nevertheless like to talk about my own region, a region of 5 million inhabitants where 500 000 people were struck by the flood, with 131 municipalities involved, 7 000 inhabitants displaced, 140 km2 flooded, three hospitals and medical facilities evacuated and two deaths."
"Farming was hard hit, and 23% of the enterprise system of the Veneto also felt the full impact."
"This is just to give you an idea of the size of this catastrophe."
"Europe must do more."
"Europe must mobilise the Solidarity Fund and we know that if the budget is not approved, the fund cannot be mobilised."
"It is all very well for us to sit here talking about great strategies, development plans and mythical programmes: Europe should also invest more in the research and prevention of hydrogeological risk, promote responsible land planning and provide incentives for the use and development of early warning systems."
"It should invest more in hydraulic defence works, because our rivers are at risk and they continue to endanger the health of our citizens."
"I therefore hope wholeheartedly that Europe, for once, will come up with a response and let its voice be heard, because it is often accused of being too far removed from its citizens."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Both natural disasters and industrial disasters, as we have seen from the recent tragedy of the toxic sludge spill in Hungary, are, unfortunately, a relatively frequent occurrence in Europe."
"The credibility of the European Union as an organisation showing solidarity in need depends on an ability to provide effective and particularly rapid assistance to affected areas and their citizens."
"The most important issue here is time."
"The rules governing any assistance should therefore be as flexible as possible, especially in the case of disasters of a cross-border nature. The condition of achieving a defined expected level of damage, regardless of the size of the affected territory and the intensity of the damage, seems unsatisfactory."
"It is actually impossible to predict everything."
"I therefore fully support changes aimed at the effective and rapid mobilisation of resources."
"Being able to help our own citizens is, in my view, a significant positive element in the perception of the EU."
"How better to prove that Europe is here for its citizens?"
"10th anniversary of UN Security Council resolution 1325 on women and peace and security (debate)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission concerning the 10th anniversary of the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 1325 on women and peace and security."
"I would like to welcome to the Chamber the representative of the Council and the representative of the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour of taking the floor in this debate on behalf of Baroness Ashton, Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy."
"Allow me, first of all, Mr President, to thank the European Parliament for its continued interest in the topic of women, peace and security, and to point out - although you obviously know this - that Parliament was the first institution, just one month after the adoption of resolution 1325, to call for its implementation by means of a resolution within this institution."
"Ten years later, we can conclude that progress has been made."
"We now have a significantly enhanced international framework, in particular, thanks to the adoption, in 2009, of resolutions 1888 and 1889."
"The appointment of the first United Nations Special Representative on violence against women in armed conflicts was an important step."
"What is more, there are currently more than 20 national plans throughout the world."
"However, the situation persists, and the reality is that the protection of women in conflict situations and their participation in peacekeeping and reconstruction processes still fall short of the pledges made and of the needs on the ground."
"Violence, and particularly sexual violence, against women and girls in conflicts continues to destroy many lives and, all too often, with complete impunity."
"The European Union is firmly committed to implementing resolution 1325 and subsequent resolutions."
"Today, we have a sound EU policy on women, peace and security, covering all aspects of the Union's external relations, from crisis management up to and including humanitarian aid and development cooperation."
"I should like to mention here a few specific achievements: one of the actions entails exchanging good practices."
"To this end, experts from the EU institutions and the Member States regularly participate in a task force."
"This process has led to an increase in the number of programmes at national level."
"10 Member States now have a national action plan and two other plans are being drafted."
"The European Union has a series of programmes designed to meet the needs of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict situations, such as the funding of medical care for victims of sexual violence."
"In less than two years, this programme has funded projects in 67 countries, with over EUR 300 million provided in total."
"The European Union has started using a gender tracker to track gender mainstreaming in development cooperation programmes."
"It has gender advisers and gender focal points in each of its 13 common security and defence policy (CSDP) missions, as well as gender focal points in more than 80 EU delegations."
"We are currently finalising a report in which conclusions are drawn from the integration of gender and human rights issues in common security and defence policy."
"The European Union is also working closely with civil society in order to promote the participation of women in the areas of peace and security."
"In 2011, we plan to launch some specific projects to support women's networks in crisis-affected countries, with an estimated budget of EUR 2 million."
"Several EU delegations have organised Open Door days to mark the 10th anniversary of resolution 1325 and to meet local women's groups, such as those in Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Iraq, for example."
"In mid-October, the European Union and the African Union organised a seminar for civil society in Addis Ababa, with a view to making recommendations for joint European Union-African Union actions."
"Furthermore, as regards renewed and measurable commitments, we plan to develop, by the end of the year, some standard training elements on gender, human rights and children's rights which will be used to train the personnel of CSDP missions; to develop, by 2013, local strategies to implement resolution 1325 in development cooperation in at least 60% of conflict and post-conflict countries; and, lastly, to report regularly on the implementation of the EU's women, peace and security commitments, by using the 17 indicators that were adopted in July 2010."
"The first report is being finalised as we speak."
"On 26 October, the European Union took part in a debate at the Security Council to mark the 10th anniversary of resolution 1325."
"The Belgian Presidency had previously organised three ministerial, high-level and expert meetings in Brussels, New York and Geneva in order to raise awareness and make recommendations."
"The European Union has accordingly made strong calls for increased international monitoring of resolution 1325, in particular by emphasising all the indicators developed by the Secretary-General."
"The European Union therefore now calls for the swift, operational implementation of those indicators."
"Mr President, thank you very much to the Belgian President-in-Office of the Council for his words on this subject."
"The Commission fully supports what the representative of the Council has just said, and I would like to add three specific points."
"Firstly, I would like to say that I entirely agree with what the President-in-Office of the Council said: there is clear progress, with more than 20 national action plans established worldwide, as well as the appointment of the first United Nations Special Representative for violence against women in armed conflicts."
"The second point I would like to make to all of you is that the Commission believes that more work needs to be done on preventing violence against women and girls in conflicts and, in particular, against sexual and gender violence, something which continues to happen and which is destroying many lives."
"Thirdly, the European Union must set an example by applying resolution 1325 and the resolutions implementing it."
"We need to continue to pay attention to the needs of women and children affected by armed conflicts, and also in post-conflict situations, through programmes financing, for example, the provision of medical services for the survivors of sexual and gender violence, by working alongside civil society to promote the participation of women in building peace and security and, of course, by working closely with the United Nations on drawing up the indicators that the Secretariat-General has developed."
"The European Union must also take other steps; for example, the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative, Baroness Ashton, has appointed the first female EU Special Representative for Sudan, Dame Rosalind Marsden."
"Mr President, the adoption of resolution 1325 by the UN Security Council ten years ago obviously represented an historical step on the part of the international community, taken in the wake of the tragic experience of the Yugoslav Wars."
"Wars take their greatest toll on the innocent civilians, and in times of armed conflicts, civilians largely consist of women."
"Our experience has shown that armed conflicts have thus far been accompanied by the rape of women, and it is no coincidence that the Geneva Convention also acknowledges that this often amounts to genocide."
"Even after the conflicts, stigmatisation and the consequences of violation continue to devastate the lives of the victims, as the scars left by physical and psychological abuse remain for life - if the victim ever recovers from them at all."
"It is therefore no overstatement to request that the prevention of violence against women become an integral part of public safety and defence policy, and that there be means by which acts of violence committed against civilians can be brought to an end."
"The efforts made by the UN in this regard can obviously not remain without appropriate response, as even today, women are being raped in their thousands in war zones, and are then cast out by their families, thus becoming double victims."
"Recently, over 8 000 women were raped in eastern Congo within a span of five days, but there is also the issue of refugee camps, such as Camp Ashraf, where women are not safe to this day."
"It is also justified to request an increase in the participation of women in peacekeeping forces, as the presence of women under these specific circumstances is of extreme importance."
"We believe that it is important for women to play a more active part in peace processes."
"We cannot allow them to simply be passive participants or even victims of such processes."
"I am pleased to note that the Commission has taken serious steps in this respect."
"Mr President, it is 10 years since UN Security Council resolution 1325 on women, peace and security was adopted."
"It is an important anniversary, more topical than ever, because women, like children, are still the biggest victims of war."
"The thousands of cases of rape in war zones prove that rape and sexual abuse are systematically used as a weapon of war to humiliate and demoralise the opponent. In numerous cases, soldiers, guided by their superiors, systematically commit rape which, if committed in public, inflicts an even greater injury on the opposing side."
"The victims of these practices, generally women, are stigmatised, rejected or even murdered by their own community in an effort to restore honour."
"We must all pull together in this fight."
"This disgrace to humanity, these war crimes, must stop."
"At the same time, we must increase controls everywhere, including by the blue berets, because we have a great deal of direct and indirect responsibility."
"Strict sanctions need to be imposed on everyone involved in such practices."
"Training, controls, discipline and a clear message are needed."
"Finally, we need to show the international community that we mean what we say."
"As resolution 1325 states, women can and must participate equally in the promotion of peace and security."
"Our common objective must be to put women in a stronger position, with the facility to take recourse to the international courts, with programmes for their economic, social and mental reintegration."
"Their emancipation and protection are the sine qua non in putting a stop to the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war."
"Mr President, exactly 10 years ago, women's rights as a fundamental element of human rights first became a topic for discussion by the UN Security Council following a call for gender equality in conflict and crisis situations."
"This was a milestone on the road to the introduction of a mandatory requirement under international law for the participation of women at decision-making levels in peace processes and security policy."
"The Secretary General at the time, Kofi Annan, made an urgent call in 2005 for national action plans to be drawn up for the implementation of resolution 1325."
"We have already heard that only 20 states have so far done this, including European countries such as Sweden and Great Britain, but also African countries, for example, Liberia and the CÃ´te d'Ivoire."
"I believe that all the EU Member States should adopt action plans of this kind."
"This also applies to countries such as Germany, where I come from, which has so far refused to compile an action plan."
"The gender perspective has definitely become more important at an international level."
"A new UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence has been appointed and the UN Entity for Gender Equality has been established."
"However, we must be aware that all of these measures are very much in their early stages."
"This is about providing support for women and girls who have been the victims of sexual violence."
"We must intensify the resolutions and the aid programmes that are already in place."
"However, this is also about support for identifying and prosecuting the offenders, which must always be linked to the reform of local judicial systems."
"Mr Chastel's message on behalf of Baroness Ashton concerning the provision of EUR 2 million to support this resolution is a very positive one."
"I would like to make it clear how important it is to involve local women's rights NGOs, so that the money goes to where it is really needed."
"Mr President, women and children are victims in wars and conflict situations."
"Violence, rape, torture and sexual assaults are weapons that are used against women and children in these situations."
"Women have now been recognised as victims, and indeed they are victims."
"They have been recognised, among other things, as a result of the appointment of Margot WallstrÃ¶m to the post of UN Special Representative."
"However, women are not just victims; they are important players in peace and security work for the prevention of conflicts."
"Their participation in the work to establish peace and democracy following wars and conflicts is essential."
"They play an active part in the reconstruction of the countries."
"Despite the fact that it is ten years since the adoption of the UN resolution, women are still only recognised as victims of violence."
"They are ignored in connection with the important reconstruction work for establishing peace and democracy."
"Despite the fact that we now know what an important part women play in this work, it is still the men who have all the influence over the decisions."
"It is time that we recognised the capability of women, including in connection with the peace and security work."
"The EU must demand that the gender perspective is taken into account when providing assistance and subsidies for reconstruction work."
"Madam President, UN Security Council resolution 1325 on women, peace and security is one of the latest serious documents in which all of the nations of the world declare their respect and reverence for the fairer sex."
"Every provision of the resolution has its own profound sense, and responds to problems which life often brings in relationships between men and women, when women and children frequently become the victims of force, unbridled violence and injustice in crisis situations."
"The advanced civilised countries subscribe to their commitments arising from UN Security Council resolution 1325 and strive, through various measures, to create the greatest possible space for applying these in national and international institutions involved in conflict resolution and the organisation of peace processes."
"However, serious problems persist over respect for the human rights of women and children in many countries in the developing world, especially in central Africa and several parts of Asia."
"The actions of barbaric military regimes are based on a different scale of values than the one recognised by the civilised world, and the human dignity of civilians, women and children means nothing to bands of murderers."
"In my opinion, this is an area we should look at and focus greater attention on as soon as possible."
"It is therefore also necessary to take measures in EU policy to exert greater and more intensive pressure on those regimes which do not respect the basic human rights of their citizens and inhabitants."
"(HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that all of us could easily answer the question as to which major group of people is essentially excluded from decision making, or is only minimally involved in it, while, at the same time, having to bear the consequences of political, economic and financial decisions to a very large extent."
"Yes, fellow Members, I am referring to women, and not only in connection with armed conflicts, which is the topic of today's sitting, but also in connection with the economy, because it is, after all, women who must put food on their families' tables, and it is women who suffer through poverty, together with their children, to an especially significant degree."
"To me, this is the core message of this UN declaration - that women should be given considerably greater opportunities in decision making, so that they can become shapers, rather than victims, of their fates."
"In what ways do armed conflicts affect women?"
"Let us look at the example of Gaza."
"Even now, it is women who are nursing and tending to those injured as a result of the brutality of the State of Israel, it is women who nurse and tend to the children who have become disabled as a consequence, and it is women who suffer significantly from the effects of the bombing and destruction of infrastructure, the bombardment of roads and schools."
"We should keep this in mind when we take account of the torments women have to endure in armed conflicts."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in conflict areas, the use of violence against women is a deliberate tactic."
"Rape is a widespread, systematic and organised practice."
"It is a weapon of war."
"We must, of course, condemn this violence."
"Condemnation aside, however, we must go beyond mere declarations, otherwise they just become a mantra."
"We must find ways to act."
"That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I am asking you to consider three courses of action."
"The first course of action: I believe we should be convinced of the need for the European Union to promote local women's organisations in all those conflict situations in which it intervenes."
"Respect for the basic principles of freedom and justice will increase if it can be founded on women."
"Wherever women are granted rights in the world, respect for human dignity and the values of equality and fraternity - which are EU values - will be promoted."
"The second course of action: when we Europeans contribute aid to help rebuild countries, I believe we should consider making it a requirement for governing powers and local authorities on the ground - which we help - to introduce quotas to ensure the participation of women at decision-making levels."
"I am thinking, for example, of the Palestinian Authority, which we help, which is funded almost entirely by us."
"The situation in the Middle East could only benefit if we demanded that the Palestinian Authority introduce quotas allowing for women to hold positions of political responsibility."
"Lastly, the third course of action: wherever we intervene, by civilian, police or military means, I believe we must undertake to give women a significant and appropriate role within our own troops and operational delegations."
"This will only serve to make us more effective and, as many reports suggest, it will probably mean that populations are more willing to accept us."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it has now been 10 years since the United Nations Security Council adopted, for the first time in its history, a resolution highlighting the specific situation of women living in combat areas and their role in resolving conflicts."
"However, today, 10 years on from that resolution, thousands of women are still being raped in war-torn countries, such as Congo for example."
"I myself have strongly criticised the impunity enjoyed for many years by the perpetrators of these atrocities."
"What is more, these barbaric acts are committed even though United Nations forces are sometimes, or even often, present on the ground."
"I believe that we are sorely lacking in political ambition and adequate funds."
"In particular, I would emphasise the need to train the field-based personnel of European and international organisations and to raise awareness among the suffering populations."
"We have to make everyone understand that taking gender considerations into account will lead to improvements in all areas."
"We must put an end to the impunity too often enjoyed by those who commit violence against women, and we must establish a proper complaints procedure in this regard."
"We must also increase the financial resources available within the European institutions for work on gender and human rights issues, in particular, so as to implement mechanisms and assess the progress made by the European Union."
"I note that, as Mr Chastel said, efforts have indeed been made, in particular, through the exchange of best practice and participation in a task force."
"Moreover, 10 Member States now have a national action plan."
"I hope that the 17 other Member States will soon have one of their own."
"Lastly, I would point out that I have high hopes for the future External Action Service."
"I hope that women and men will participate in it equally, in particular, on the ground."
"We must never forget the important role women play in resolving conflicts or the need to establish communication that is based on trust between the forces of international institutions and local populations."
"(PT) Madam President, highlighting the effect of wars and conflicts on women and children is of the utmost importance at a time as critical as this, when wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are dragging on, severe conflicts are being fuelled, such as in the Israeli-occupied territories of Palestine, or the Western Sahara occupied by Morocco, inequalities are increasing, poverty is being exacerbated by neoliberal policies, and new threats are arising, as happened this weekend in Lisbon with the NATO summit and the adoption of its new strategic concept."
"In response to this, a peaceful demonstration took place last Saturday in the streets of Lisbon, organised by the 'Yes to peace, no to NATO' campaign, which includes more than 100 organisations."
"Tens of thousands of people, men and women, marched calling for peace and social justice, which is essential for security, and shouting and demanding the dissolution of NATO, nuclear disarmament and respect for people's rights in the defence of peace."
"In the general strike which is to take place in Portugal tomorrow, men and women will again protest against anti-social policies."
"These affect everyone, but they are particularly discriminatory towards women."
"The protesters will demand new policies which respect the dignity of workers and promote development and social progress, a prerequisite for peace."
"(SK) Madam President, I, too, would like to emphasise the historical importance of Security Council resolution 1325 for peace and for security policy."
"It was the first time that the UN emphasised the importance of the protection of women and their full involvement in creating peace, maintaining peace and preventing conflicts."
"It must be said that great efforts have been made over the past 10 years to achieve this aim."
"However, abuse of women is often still a major characteristic of conflicts."
"What is more, there has been an alarming increase in frequent and systematic violence against women both during and after conflicts."
"I will not give any concrete figures, but it is surely worth mentioning the horrific events that have taken place in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Darfur, Rwanda, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Bosnia."
"I have personally met and spoken with women who were victims of violence during the war in the former Yugoslavia."
"Their stories are horrific."
"They were raped, tortured and humiliated."
"Many were ostracised even after the conflict was over."
"So not even the cessation of conflict will guarantee an end to violence against women."
"We should always bear this in mind."
"Protection of women and enabling their participation in the creation of peace and security is the main aim of resolution 1325."
"Unfortunately, this has yet to happen in many cases."
"I firmly believe there is a real chance that we can change things."
"However, the political will of all is required if we are to create the actual conditions."
"In fulfilling this task, I also see the opportunity for a positive contribution from High Representative Baroness Ashton and the European External Action Service, which could greatly strengthen the role of the EU in implementing this important resolution."
"(DE) Madam President, women and children continue to be disproportionately hard hit by wars and their consequences."
"However, women's rights must not be misused in order to give legitimacy to military interventions."
"The example of the Republic of Congo shows that military measures do not help to protect, secure or establish women's rights."
"Unfortunately, exactly the opposite is true."
"The situation of women in Afghanistan today is worse than ever as a result of the war."
"The promise made in resolution 1325 can only really be honoured by avoiding conflict and taking only civil measures in war and conflict situations."
"Therefore, I believe that it is completely unacceptable to distort this resolution with the aim of increasing the number of women involved in warfare."
"I am calling for the EU to stop providing support on principle, including aid for equipment and training, to regimes and military forces which send child soldiers into armed conflicts, violate human rights or commit systematic acts of sexual violence."
"(PT) Madam President, the resolutions of the Security Council and plans for supporting development have already been mentioned, with emphasis on the advances that have been made, but the fact is that women continue to be the main victims of armed conflicts."
"They are victims, yet not decision makers."
"Women should participate in the entire process of preventing and resolving conflicts."
"If there were more women in senior positions of policy making, including economic decision making, there would certainly be more peace and security in the world, and we would all benefit from greater development and better living conditions."
"That is why we also need more women involved in decision making at all levels."
"As has already been said here, women should participate and be players throughout this process; it should not be conducted only by men."
"Madam President, when speaking about women in conflict zones, we have to consider that despite increased efforts and good signs, such as the appointment of former Commissioner Margot WallstrÃ¶m to the office of special representative of the UN Secretary-General on sexual violence in conflict, as well as the recent creation of 'UN Women', there is still a need for further action, greater awareness and practical political actions in this field."
"I would strongly highlight the fact that partnerships between parliamentarians, EU and UN Member State governments, institutions and civil society are vital for building support for the agreed goals and objectives of the action programme of the international conference on population and development as regards the Millennium Development Goals."
"In the context of gender equality, we have to make a joint commitment to pushing this issue forward, ensuring better representation of women in an effort to prevent war, restore peace and cope with post-conflict situations, taking into account that women can play a significant role in peacekeeping if they are properly supported and genuinely included."
"In conclusion, I would like to point out that the EU has a crucial role to play in advancing these objectives to achieve an equitable and lasting solution."
"It is our primary responsibility and important political role to work together to address the situation of women in conflict zones by means of preventing war and maintaining international peace and security."
"Madam President, I want to give my support to resolution 1325."
"I turn the House's attention to the situation in Northern Ireland, where we have a very active women's sector - a sector that has been a force for good within the country."
"Before coming to this House, I represented West Belfast in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Shankill area of Belfast in local government."
"These are areas that have been ravaged by over 30 years of violence inflicted through a terrorist campaign by Irish Republicans and intra-community violence."
"Throughout that time, groups like the Women's Centre have been a cohesive force, enhancing community capacity and forging links with other women's groups in other communities."
"They are ordinary women who have proved themselves to be leaders and an excellent role model for other countries and communities that find themselves faced with terrorism and violence."
"Today, groups like the Shankill Women's Centre, the Foyle Women's Network and Training for Women are not only forging the way ahead in community relations in Northern Ireland, but are also giving women opportunities in the labour market through education and training."
"This is the way forward, colleagues."
"(RO) Madam President, I hope that this debate which we are having today will not only be an occasion for marking the anniversary of resolution 1325, but also a new beginning and new approach to this issue, which persists virtually in the same forms that led to the adoption of resolution 1325."
"I do not believe that declarations are enough, especially declarations which convey a different picture of reality."
"I believe that action is needed and it is the European Union's task, as part of the current security policy, to create an initial code of conduct to be used in both conflicts and post-conflict operations, although we have a convention, in the form of the Geneva Convention, which condemns violent conduct during conflicts."
"I believe that a code of conduct of this kind would provide added value for the European Union, marking a step towards resolving this issue."
"The other aspects of involvement must undoubtedly be supported by consistent financial assistance based on a strategy for our development projects."
"(SK) Madam President, we are marking the 10th anniversary of UN resolution 1325, and there are almost daily reports of other resolutions and declarations aiming to help women."
"However, I have my doubts as to whether we are monitoring their fulfilment sufficiently."
"More and more documents are being produced, but the situation of women is improving only very slowly."
"It is our duty to work for compliance with and the protection of the rights of all women, so that they can be fully integrated into society, regardless of their situation, origin or status."
"Their role begins in the family, not only because they are irreplaceable in raising children to respect human dignity for all, but there are also women who, aware of a threat to their families, get involved in preventing and solving military conflicts."
"However, until women feel safe in their families and in their countries, it is impossible to talk about peace, and not only in countries where there is no war."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I clearly agree with Parliament on a very large number of points."
"How could I fail to agree in particular with Mr Juvin's and Mr Tarabella's calls for the creation of the European External Action Service to represent a major opportunity to strengthen EU policy on women, peace and security?"
"During the process of establishing the service, the ongoing challenge of ensuring greater representation of women at every level, including within personnel units, and especially at the highest level, must be recognised."
"Baroness Ashton is very clearly working on this."
"She has taken some steps in this direction, for example, by appointing Rosalind Marsden as the EU's first female Special Representative to Sudan."
"In September, she appointed 29 people to senior positions within the delegations, including seven female heads of delegation, which is nothing short of a 50% increase in the number of women at this level."
"At the same time as the EU undertakes major efforts to strengthen its capabilities in relation to the participation of women, peace and security, we believe that it is also important to take steps to raise awareness within other organisations and countries."
"This goes hand in hand with specific training activities."
"Many of you have spoken on this issue too."
"Within the framework of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, the Union supports the United Nations in the implementation of resolutions on women, peace and security in countries and regions that are particularly affected, such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and the Fergana Valley, which spans Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan."
"Lastly, the European Union continues to believe in the importance of increased delegation of responsibilities at international level."
"The Union believes that the Security Council should establish a working group to examine the progress made in implementing resolution 1325 and to make recommendations to the Council in order to meet the challenges and remedy the shortcomings that exist and to speed up the implementation of that resolution."
"The Union has therefore called on the Security Council to redouble its efforts in the fight against impunity."
"Targeted and progressive measures should be imposed against any party to a conflict that is responsible for serious violations of women's rights."
"I am convinced that the European Parliament will continue to support the efforts made by the Union and the Member States in this area."
"I have received six motions for a resolution from the various political groups on this subject."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 25 November, at 12:00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"All the assertive efforts undertaken - the resolutions and national and international plans for improving the level of protection for women in conflict zones - have failed to eliminate this barbaric weapon which is frequently resorted to in modern warfare: sexual violence."
"On the contrary, impunity provides conditions conducive to the spread of this practice which is diametrically opposed to our values."
"I have repeatedly spoken out, along with others, against the acts of mass rape perpetrated in the Congo, Liberia and other conflict zones, especially in Africa."
"The thousands of women falling victim to sexual abuse and violence are also being condemned to bear in the future the social stigma and burden of terrible diseases, such as HIV."
"The International Day against Violence against Women, which we mark on 25 November, must also remind us that women are victims of domestic violence, which is occurring with alarming frequency, marital rape, sexual harassment and human trafficking."
"Gender-related violence, whether committed in the home or armed conflict zones, is one of the most serious human rights violations and must be opposed and punished accordingly."
"Over the years, the traditional role of peace missions has changed."
"It is now not only monitoring ceasefire agreements or ensuring that borders between states are respected."
"Currently, missions are engaged in a range of 'soft' activities - promoting human rights and democracy in a wide variety of ways, supporting the organisation of elections and restoring the rule of law."
"On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325, attention should be drawn to the particular role of women in these processes."
"In many cases, they are far better predisposed to carrying out the tasks of peace missions."
"Among other things, I am thinking, here, of work with the victims of sexually motivated violence and violence based on sexual discrimination."
"Women work in women's prisons, they help with social reintegration and they also conduct numerous forms of training."
"We talk a lot about increasing the participation of women in politics and business."
"In none of these areas has it yet been possible to achieve full equality of opportunities."
"This is why it is necessary to return to these issues and look carefully at the way in which legislation which has been adopted is brought into force, so that on the 15th or 20th anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325, it will be possible to say that all of its provisions have been implemented."
"State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Bernhard Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines - C7-0296/2010 - 2010 /0220(NLE)) (Î7-0324/2010)."
"Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate you, Mr Almunia, and your offices."
"The impact assessment that you have presented is very good."
"It is based on facts, it is conclusive and it gets to the point."
"It is a pity that the other members of the College of Commissioners have not read this impact assessment, because if they had read it, they would not have been able to present this proposal, which has nothing at all to do with the impact assessment."
"I wonder how the College of Commissioners picked the year, for example."
"There is absolutely no mention of this in the impact assessment."
"The only thing which might explain it is that 2014 is exactly halfway between 2010 and 2018."
"That is what it must be."
"However, it may be that they have also not understood the content."
"None of the arguments in favour of this proposal can be seriously considered because they are not correct."
"There is the argument that the State aid scheme adopted in 2002, which is about to expire, was a phasing out arrangement for coal mining."
"Of course, this is totally incorrect."
"It was a successor arrangement."
"I know this, because I was there and I was the rapporteur for Parliament in 2002."
"This is when the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) expired after 50 years and a successor arrangement was needed, not only with regard to aid, but also other issues."
"If this had been a phasing out arrangement, what would have happened, for example, to the ECSC's assets?"
"It was not a phasing out arrangement, it was a successor arrangement."
"At the time, we agreed with good reason on a period of eight years for this successor arrangement, after which we would look at the issue again."
"Therefore, this argument is incorrect."
"The second argument which is put forward is the question of sustainability."
"We are all in favour of this and we know that coal, of course, produces large quantities of CO2 emissions."
"However, a decision made by the Commission cannot abolish the laws of science."
"What will happen next?"
"Domestic coal will be replaced by imported coal."
"That is the only thing that will happen."
"Imported coal emits just the same amount of CO2 as domestic coal."
"The problem is simply that if we no longer have reference points, we will not be able to use them in the development of new, state-of-the-art technologies for mining and power stations."
"Europe is a leader in this area and has an export advantage."
"I do not believe that we should just give this up."
"The third argument is that aid is harmful and that the money would be better spent on other things."
"It is not possible to say anything against this argument or against the attitude of market radicals."
"You cannot oppose an ideology with facts."
"However, the statement that this would be too expensive, for example, should be looked at in the light of what it would really mean if mining were to be stopped abruptly, and 2014 would be an abrupt stop."
"It would result in an increase in the costs of combating unemployment and, above all, in the costs relating to long-term pit closures."
"This is a very complicated and complex subject."
"The costs of long-term pit closures continue to be incurred years and even decades after coal mining comes to an end."
"The costs have to be paid out of the public purse."
"However, some Member States have a system in place which ensures that the state is not responsible for these costs."
"Therefore, this argument also does not hold water."
"For this reason, I recommend that you think this over again as soon as possible and that you pay attention to what is said in the impact assessment."
"Otherwise, the result will be regional and socio-political distortions, which we do not want."
"This is why the 2018 proposal is highly sensible."
"Madam President, thank you very much to Mr Rapkay for his report on behalf of Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The Commission has closely analysed both the report and the amendments proposed for this debate with great interest, and we have taken note of the fact that the report specifically supports extending the deadline for closing uncompetitive mines to 2018."
"The Commission is also aware that in recent debates that have taken place in the Permanent Representatives Committee (Coreper), the majority supported the 2018 deadline, as Mr Rapkay's report suggests."
"When we prepared the proposal for a regulation and analysed this situation, we in the Commission were, of course, fully aware of the social and regional impact of the closure of coal mines in certain regions of the EU."
"However, when drawing up the regulation, we also took into account the fact that some of the mines are not competitive and have only survived so far thanks to constant injections of public money and public subsidies."
"Therefore, in our proposal for a regulation, we allowed the Member States to grant additional operating aid, but on this occasion, for the specific purpose of facilitating the gradual closure of uncompetitive mines."
"I would like to discuss three points that are considered in the report."
"Firstly, the proposal to grant operating aid or investment in order to make the mines competitive."
"There was already a similar provision in the previous regulation concerning aid to the sector."
"However, the previous regulation largely failed to achieve the desired effects and, rather than guiding the coal mines towards profitability, it created a moral hazard to some extent."
"The mines were subsidised in the vain hope of achieving profitability."
"Now we have to deal with the consequences: we need to extend this special system for coal production because the mines concerned have not achieved profitability, nor have they been closed."
"In any case, the mines that have credible forecasts of profitability do not need State aid and can obtain the required capital from the capital or financial markets."
"Secondly, I would like to explain why, in our proposal, we consider it to be necessary to have a plan to minimise the effects on the environment."
"Article 3(1) of our proposal mentions this point."
"State aid distorts competition."
"Therefore, the treaty contains provisions for declaring it incompatible in a whole range of cases."
"Operating aid can only be authorised if it is likely to have positive effects."
"Our regulation proposes a plan to mitigate the environmental impact of the use of coal in order to offset the negative effects of the aid."
"Finally, my third point is that when the objective of the operating aid is to contribute to a transition towards closing uncompetitive mines, it is clear that this closure must be gradual and cannot take place only when the deadline arrives."
"This gradual nature must be clearly set out in the closure plan, and the plan must also include a diminishing proportion of that aid during the transition period."
"Our proposal therefore establishes a linear reduction in aid by a percentage that clearly aims for the removal of aid at the end of the transition period."
"Having said all this, I would once again like to thank Mr Rapkay and everyone who contributed to the report that we are considering."
"We will consider Parliament's position on the report, and we are continuing the debates in the Council, naturally in consultation with the Belgian Presidency."
"In light of Parliament's position and based on what the Council's position turns out to be, the Commission will, of course, give its opinion in the next few weeks."
"Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, no one disputes the fact that coal is an important part of our energy supply."
"It is also indisputable that the mining industry must be competitive and that subsidising it is not the correct approach."
"The question now is whether 2014 or 2018 is the right deadline."
"Mr Rapkay put forward a number of intelligent arguments which I will not repeat."
"I have only one request to the Commission."
"In all the committees in Parliament which were involved, there is majority support for making competitiveness a criterion."
"When it comes to the deadline, we must simply ensure that there is the necessary flexibility to allow the Member States to keep the pressure on the people, the jobs and the economic structures at a manageable level."
"The only argument which has been mentioned and which, incidentally, conflicts with the Commission's impact statement that initially seemed to be in favour of 2018, was that environmental policy reasons could play a role here."
"I would like to emphasise once again that it makes no difference to the climate whether we burn imported or domestic coal."
"My request to the Commissioner is to consider, if Parliament and the Council can come up with new arguments of this kind, whether this four-year deadline could lead to the Commission being a little more flexible."
"This is how I understood the reference just now to the Commission considering the issue and I am grateful for this."
"Madam President, on behalf of the REGI Committee, we welcome the Commission proposal, although we have recommended certain amendments."
"We also recommended extending the deadline for closing uncompetitive mines."
"Without this change, there would be a risk that entire regions affected by mine closures would fall into poverty and would face serious social problems."
"Among other things, we also proposed adjusting the use of cohesion resources for regions affected in this way."
"The committee also believes that the closure of uncompetitive mines is not the only acceptable way of using State aid for such mines, as it should also be used to facilitate development targeted on achieving competitiveness."
"If a mine becomes competitive by a certain date, that is surely a desirable situation, which is in the interests both of the region concerned and, eventually, the Union as a whole."
"The importance of coal-fired power stations rests, among other things, on the fact that they are practically the only plants capable of responding immediately and flexibly through increased production when there is a sudden increase in demand for electricity, independently of other factors."
"If the greater energy security of the Union is to be more than just an empty slogan, we cannot manage without stable and competitive coal mines and a coal industry."
"Madam President, I would like, first of all, to encourage Mr Almunia to stick with his original proposal of 2018."
"This proposal was well-founded and was based on economic, regional, social and energy policy grounds."
"I do not understand why the College of Commissioners has introduced environmental reasons which are completely irrelevant."
"As previous speakers have said, it makes no difference whether we burn imported coal or coal that we have mined and subsidised ourselves."
"Our climate footprint is largely the same in both cases."
"In fact, it is probably much worse for imported coal because this has to be transported here from Canada, Australia or other regions of the world."
"This is why the justification is wrong."
"I would like to thank Mr Rapkay for producing this proposal in close cooperation with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"I believe that it concerns a Council regulation."
"There is a loophole in the Treaty of Lisbon which means that regulations on the basis of competition law do not form part of Parliament's codecision procedure."
"Instead, the process, which does not involve a proper assessment, is still based on Regulation No 17 dating back to 1965."
"Therefore, we now need - at least as far as our statement is concerned - a broad majority vote, so that coal, which is one of the most important energy sources still available to us in Europe, remains competitive in future."
"Our group will give Mr Rapkay's report its unrestricted support."
"We want to encourage Mr Almunia to prompt the Commission to put forward a new proposal of 2018 and we want to amend two points in the report that has been adopted."
"One of these concerns the question of the way in which the aid is to be gradually reduced."
"We are of the opinion that this should be left to the Member States over this eight-year period."
"The second point concerns the fact that the regulation as a whole will be phased out in 2030."
"That is also the stage which the Council's discussions have reached on this regulation."
"Only when Parliament makes a clear decision in favour of 2018 will we be able to carry out an appropriate evaluation of the social, political, energy policy, economic and regional grounds."
"Madam President, this is not a straightforward matter."
"It is therefore important for us in Parliament to establish a well-balanced position."
"There are two main aspects to take into consideration."
"On the one hand, it is unreasonable, in the long term, to continue to keep this uncompetitive form of mining alive artificially."
"For reasons relating to both the environment and competition, it is unsustainable to use public subsidy programmes to ensure that unprofitable coal mining continues."
"It is therefore logical for the subsidies for this activity now to be phased out."
"On the other hand, the abolition of subsidies will have a huge impact, not only on the tens of thousands of coal miners who will be forced to look for new jobs, but also on their families and everyone else who depends on mining."
"It will be a very difficult adjustment for the people living in the regions affected."
"Weighing up these two aspects is not easy."
"Nevertheless, I think the Commission has found a reasonable balance in its proposal."
"The subsidies will be discontinued, but this will be carefully managed, taking into consideration both jobs and the environment."
"The regions concerned will suffer a difficult setback when the subsidies are discontinued but, at the same time, the proposal provides the opportunity for comprehensive social and environmental measures with a view to making this regional adjustment process as efficient as possible."
"It is extremely important for all of these opportunities to be fully utilised by national and regional authorities."
"Large-scale investment in active labour market initiatives and comprehensive environmental restoration measures is essential if the end result is to be acceptable for these regions."
"So far, the debate has focused on three issues."
"Firstly, the argument has been put forward that the coal mines that become competitive during the closure period should be able to continue to operate."
"In my opinion, it would be wrong to include this option, because the aid that is to be granted must be used in the right way and based on definitive closure."
"Secondly, an end date for the closure aid has been discussed."
"In this regard, it is important to note that the current regulation has been in existence since 2002 and that everyone was aware that the exemptions from the competition rules would expire this year."
"There was therefore nothing very surprising in this."
"I can be flexible when it comes to the exact year."
"Thirdly, opinions have been divided regarding the environmental and sustainability elements in Parliament's position."
"I believe that these elements should be as clear as possible, and they should definitely be more prominent than they are in the text produced by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"It is very important that we send out the right signal in this regard."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I have to say that I am very touched by the new romance between the EPP and the S&D Group, but I do feel that the intimate and loving embrace between Mr Rapkay and Mr Lange is keeping Europe firmly stuck in the past."
"We are talking about the seventh extension of the special State aid regime."
"Mr Rapkay himself has indicated that he was rapporteur back in 2002."
"Who will give us a guarantee that we are not going to have the same debate in 2018?"
"Because the reasons that were valid back in 2002 that are valid today, will still be valid in 2018."
"Therefore, my group, without reserve, endorses the position of the Commission."
"We have requested a separate vote on Amendments 25 and 27, and we call on all colleagues in the two big groups to vote against those amendments and support the position of the Commission to phase out the support by 2014."
"I know that votes took place in the different committees, but I also know that there are many colleagues in the two big groups who feel deeply uncomfortable with the current position."
"I think they should realise that they have all the freedom in the world to vote according to their conscience, because it is not actually the European Parliament that decides."
"So they should vote in order to state their views."
"We are not negotiating; we do not have to compromise."
"We can give a very strong political signal in support of the Commission, and therefore I think this European Parliament should act as a counterweight to the very strong political pressure from the Member States on the Commission and show that this Parliament is looking to the future and not to the past."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has no objection to public funds being invested, provided that they act as a catalyst for the transformation that our society, our industry, our economy must go through to become fairer and, above all, more sustainable."
"We must remember that aid for uncompetitive coal mines goes against these objectives."
"It props up an industry that is not sustainable either economically - otherwise it would not need subsidies - or environmentally."
"As Mrs in 't Veld emphasised just now, for several decades, the coal industry has been calling for this transition to be extended, with no end in sight."
"Equally, my fellow German Members, for several decades, many European countries have been striving to put an end to what is an unsustainable industry."
"This is true of my country, France, and it is true of many other countries too."
"We therefore support the Commission's proposal and, by extension, the proposal for subsidies to be used so that the workers concerned can be redeployed in a decent and dignified fashion."
"However, under the pressure of what you have heard today, the Commission is preparing to beat a rather inglorious retreat, Mr Almunia, under the pressure exerted by, among others, your colleague Mr Oettinger, whose behaviour in this matter has not been that of a Member of a College responsible for defending the general interest, but of an official representative of the specific, sectoral interests of one particular country, Germany."
"What is more, he makes no secret of it!"
"To conclude, I should like to say to you that, as long as the European Union, as long as the Member States put all their energies into supporting industries of the past, with public money, which - and I hope the Irish crisis reminds us of this - has become extremely scarce, as long as we support, with this public money, 19th-century industries, we will not enable Europe to take the lead in 21st-century industries."
"Meanwhile, the world is changing, and changing fast."
"Madam President, the proposal presented by the European Commission was evidently written under the dictates of climate policy and without consideration of the social consequences - particularly the consequences in the field of energy - in countries such as Germany, Spain and Poland."
"We must remember that the world coal market is changing before our eyes."
"Demand for coal, and the price of coal, are rising."
"Therefore, mines which today are unprofitable, will, perhaps, be profitable in the future."
"The departure from coal also presents very serious problems for energy security in such countries as Poland, which generate as much as 95% of their electricity from coal."
"The departure from coal in such situations can involve only one alternative - a still greater dependence on gas, which is imported from only one direction."
"Therefore, before we decide on political pressure in favour of abandoning coal in such cases, we should ensure diversification and also security of gas supply, because this is, today, the only real alternative for the energy sector in countries which use coal for this purpose."
"These are the reasons why we will support the compromises presented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, where we have proposed that the regulation give the possibility to national budgets - which are not EU budgets, after all - to maintain mines in countries in which this is necessary, and also the compromise which suggests that the regulation could be in force until 2030."
"I think the initial proposals of the European Commission were significantly closer to precisely this position."
"Only at the final stage did the European Commission decide to propose the unrealistic deadline of 2014."
"(DE) Madam President, it is not only justifiable for us to continue supporting the coal industry, but, in my opinion, it is also absolutely essential."
"We must go on providing support not only until 2014, but also beyond that time."
"It is our duty to protect the citizens of the European Union from the many negative impacts of globalisation."
"This also includes offering workers in industries which are not fully competitive on the world market long-term retraining to allow them to take on other jobs."
"You do not need to be an expert to realise that specialised workers are needed in the mining industry."
"Many miners work in the pits for their entire lives."
"Therefore, in my opinion, we need plenty of time in order to be able to offer all of them new jobs."
"It may no longer be sensible to give older miners the option of retraining."
"We must enable mining regions to become gradually less dependent on the mining industry without their prosperity being significantly reduced."
"These regions still have considerable economic potential if they are given the opportunity of restructuring their economies."
"The drastic reduction in the subsidies for coal mining over recent years has represented an ordeal for many mining regions."
"A number of areas were not able to react quickly enough to the changes in economic conditions because of their strong links with the mining industry."
"The result has been increased poverty."
"This does not have to be the case."
"We can protect many European regions from major economic and social damage and, therefore, we must vote in favour of these regulations."
"(SV) Madam President, when it comes to State aid for the coal industry, my view is that we should do everything we can to make the European economy as competitive as possible, and we should do this in many different areas."
"We must have a goal when it comes to the automotive industry, the engineering industry and the medical industry."
"In order to be successful we need to transform our economy to enable it to meet the demands of modern competition and the global economy."
"In light of this, I have serious doubts about the intention now to extend the state subsidies for unprofitable coal mines."
"It will mean that, at state level, we will be tying up money in undertakings which are not profitable, which are unable to support the jobs that we are talking about and which will not help to improve the environment."
"It will also mean that the transformation we need in order to be able to become truly competitive will be slower."
"It will mean that we fail to develop within other areas and also that, in a few years time, people will still be employed in industries that do not offer long-term security and the opportunity to make a living, and those regions that we are now talking about will still remain dependent on coal mining in what are unprofitable coal mines."
"Against this background, I believe that we should support the Commission's proposal, and we will vote in favour of it."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Almunia, we need to bite the bullet now, rather than prolonging the agony."
"This is what comes to mind when I think about the subject that we are discussing today."
"I support the Commission proposal to phase out State aid in 2014 for the pits which are not competitive by that date."
"The cost of each job in the coal mining industry is much higher than the average."
"This money is not being spent on developing sustainable and competitive employment for the future."
"Therefore, I believe it is right to phase out state subsidies for uncompetitive mines in 2014."
"We must invest the money which becomes available in research and development and in education and training."
"This is the only way in which we can maintain our technological head start and remain competitive in the global economy as a whole."
"(RO) Madam President, I think that both the mine closure proposal and the suggestion to reduce subsidies would be too premature and that they would have undesirable socio-economic and regional repercussions."
"We must not forget that Europe's mining sector provides approximately 100 000 jobs, 42 000 in coal mining and 55 000 in related sectors, and that certain regions in Europe are totally dependent economically on this sector."
"A large number of people in these regions work in mines or have jobs relating to this sector."
"These measures could have adverse consequences, to the extent of leaving communities in absolute poverty."
"This is why a strategy for retraining the workers affected by the mine closure plans must be devised quickly."
"At the same time, special support is required from the European Union's Structural Funds in order to provide mutual assistance to the regions which will suffer as a result of these measures."
"In addition, mine workers and their families may lose their confidence in the political process where such decisions are made which affect them directly, if they are made at an inappropriate time."
"We need to focus our attention just as much on sparsely populated regions, which will suffer the most in socio-economic terms."
"I do not believe that 2014 is a realistic deadline for closing the mines."
"On the other hand, the deadline of 2020 specifically proposed by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy did not receive sufficient positive feedback."
"This is why I think that we can find common ground with 2018."
"I wish to mention another point, which is that the coal industry is an integral part of European policy and is the EU's own source, thereby guaranteeing supply security."
"A transition period is required which will allow these mines, and those mines which could become competitive, to become gradually more competitive, in order to ensure access to European coal and avoid an adverse socio-economic impact."
"(CS) Madam President, in my opinion, there is no dispute over the fact that subsidies to particular segments of the economy distort and destroy economic competition, and that State aid is therefore damaging to the healthy functioning of the market, not only in the short term but also in the long term."
"We are talking here about regions that will be, or might be, affected by a high level of unemployment, but, on the other hand, we need to remember the regions that have already gone through restructuring in this sector of the economy, and which have endured high unemployment and coped with it."
"In today's vote, the ECR therefore supports all proposals that will result in individual Member States having sufficient time to implement the extensive retraining of workers, to organise the removal and elimination of environmental burdens associated with coal extraction, and also to be able to absorb all of the social upheavals in time."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, it is a shame that Parliament has a right to nothing more than consultation when what we are talking about is the future of 180 000 European families and the European Union's indigenous energy source par excellence."
"Subsidies are not a general route to competitiveness, but making European coal competitive through subsidies is strategically necessary, first of all, because 60% of European energy is imported, and out of the remaining 40%, a large proportion is nuclear - which the majority of this House does not support - and secondly, because of price increases: the European coal price is moving closer and closer to the international coal price."
"Moreover, I would like to ask you: what is competitive coal?"
"Ask yourselves whether all the coal that the European Union imports includes the social and safety costs of the mines that are included in the cost of European coal."
"Is this the model that many of you want for Europe?"
"Do you agree with the importation of products from outside our continent that do not comply with the principles of Union preference and do not incorporate social rights?"
"Do you reject this same idea for European coal?"
"The longer this period is, the better, so that we can introduce the clean combustion and storage technologies that already exist in the European Union."
"Without European coal, if we cause European mines to close, there will be no incentive to continue reducing emissions from thermal power stations, which will continue to burn imported coal and to produce CO2."
"What do you prefer: do you want CO2 to come to us from outside the European Union or do you want it to be possible for CO2 to be treated and stored using our own European technology?"
"I do not believe that rejecting the possibility of EU coal, as you are doing, is liberalism: I believe it is hypocrisy."
"(RO) Madam President, coal is an important component in the European Union's energy mix."
"The coal mining sector provides 280 000 jobs in the European Union, especially in mono-industry areas."
"This is why it is important for the Union to supply the largest proportion possible of its coal requirements from domestic production, obviously at a competitive price, based on streamlining the coal extraction and processing procedure."
"Unless State aid is granted, production will fall by 20%, resulting in 100 000 lost jobs."
"State aid for the hard coal industry is an absolute necessity for uncompetitive mines."
"They are uncompetitive due to their obsolete technical equipment."
"State aid would allow these facilities to be retrofitted to ensure job security."
"Compared with the Commission's proposal, we are in favour of moving the mine closure deadline."
"The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy voted for 2020 and we will support the compromise which the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, has successfully reached, along with fellow Members in other political groups."
"We support the removal of Article 3(1)(h), especially the percentage stipulated for gradually removing the aid granted so that Member States which are going to grant State aid to uncompetitive coal mines have the maximum flexibility possible."
"However, I think that Member States should also present plans for the economic and social development of mining regions, which are often mono-industry regions."
"The aim of these development plans should be job creation and investment in energy efficiency and energy production from renewable sources."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, for his report and the work he has done."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Almunia on the open debate that has taken place in the Commission."
"There are good reasons why you and the Commission President, Mr Barroso, took part in the debate in the College of Commissioners with a very different year in mind."
"I am pleased that the Commission is able to discuss issues so openly from a regulatory perspective and then to reverse its decision."
"That is both admirable and remarkable."
"It is a good thing that you are supporting the new decision here."
"There are a number of good grounds for this decision."
"Nevertheless, the Member States which are affected have been making plans."
"There are plans in place and I can only say that I am pleased that the review clause has been removed, which stated that we would have to open up the whole can of worms once again from 2012 onwards in the largest Member State affected, in other words, Germany."
"This means that your debate in the College of Commissioners has also had a very successful outcome."
"I know that 2018 will eventually come around."
"I am also pleased about the fact that the mining industry has the security to plan ahead and I will vote accordingly."
"However, I can see that regulatory policy is the winner here."
"(RO) Madam President, I have already listened to the views of my fellow Members who emphasised how important coal is to the European economy's energy security."
"I would like to introduce another argument."
"In some countries, including Romania, in years affected by drought - which have been growing in number - there is a fall in the production of hydroelectric and nuclear energy."
"The only resource which my country and other countries have had at their immediate disposal for increasing energy production has been coal."
"We have a number of mines which are not profitable, but they have restructuring programmes extending beyond 2014."
"As a liberal, I am against subsidies being granted to commercial companies, but not in the case of companies which have definite restructuring programmes."
"As a result, I am going to support the amendment which proposes a longer transition period for discontinuing the subsidies granted to unprofitable coal mines."
"(RO) Madam President, although subsidised coal accounts for only a small proportion of the European Union's electricity production, the immediate and simultaneous closure of hard coal mines will have a considerable social impact in certain areas of Europe."
"We are talking here about a large number of people working in this branch of the industry who will not be able to be re-employed immediately in other sectors, thereby causing unemployment and the emergence of disadvantaged areas."
"I think that immediate measures are needed to retrain these people, using EU funds."
"Until this happens, it is absolutely imperative to extend the date until State aid can be granted for the closure of production units, at least until 2018."
"I also think that it must be up to the relevant Member State to determine the level of reduction in State aid after a certain period and Member States must not have minimum limits imposed on them."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say a few things to our Liberal friends and to Mrs in 't Veld in particular."
"Competition will not be distorted, because the coal-fired power stations will continue to operate using imported coal, which will increase their carbon footprint."
"In other words, the argument does not make sense, whichever way you look at it."
"In addition, this cannot be continued after 2018, for example, in Germany's case, because the treaty, which applies to those involved and not just to the state, requires everything to come to an end in 2018, so that the long-term costs of pit closures do not have to be borne by the state."
"The long-term costs, which will amount to many millions over several centuries, will be paid by a foundation."
"If the foundation were to collapse, it would cost the state a lot of money for an indefinite period."
"Having developed such a clever concept with a clear end point, it is important to do justice to it and not to attempt to come up with theoretical definitions of the market which are completely unrelated to the reality of the agreement."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, who has been to my region of Asturias which, many years ago, shaped the origins of Spain and of Europe, and which, thanks to its coal and to its people, is at the forefront of modern society."
"Mining areas need to continue in this commendable revitalising effort without encountering obstacles from the European Union."
"Instead, they should have its encouragement."
"We need to remove the threat of indigenous coal mining coming to an end, and instead enable this strategic sector to survive in a reasonable manner."
"We also need to help the sector to achieve competitiveness within a reasonable period, without penalising the businesses later."
"Above all, we need to achieve pollution-free extraction soon."
"The substantial investments in clean coal must go primarily to benefit Europe and its own mining areas."
"It is absurd for those who oppose European coal to defend or tolerate coal from other parts of the world, which is produced with greater environmental impact, a huge lack of safety and salaries that are not competitive."
"This situation will discriminate against our own territory and it is simply intolerable that it should arise."
"Let us maintain our mining sector by taking advantage of new technologies."
"(ES) Madam President, competitiveness is important, but it cannot be the only criterion."
"Our energy dependence means that only coal can guarantee us a secure supply as an indigenous source of fossil fuel, and the economic and social importance of mining in several European regions means that the closure of the mines must not be seen as inescapable, be it in 2014 or 2018."
"If we continue to be dependent on coal as an energy source, in 2018, we will have to continue to guarantee the energy supply, either using aid - if the mines are not competitive - or without aid - if they are competitive."
"We must also consider not only the economic competitiveness of coal, but also its competitiveness in employment and environmental terms."
"European coal is safe coal, and we have to see this, especially at a time when accidents in mines are the order of the day outside Europe."
"Moreover, European coal is coal that can be clean."
"Therefore, in the amendments to the Rapkay report, we ask for an indefinite extension to the aid for costs related to CO2 capture and to any other technology that enables coal to be burned more cleanly."
"(CS) Madam President, this measure confirms the old saying that a financier has a hold on the state like a rope has a hold on a man who has been hung."
"I would like to say three things."
"First, I think that money should go to support those competitive mines at risk, which account for 5% of mines throughout the European Union."
"We should also prevent imports of subsidised coal from abroad."
"Thirdly, we should prevent any interference from lobbyists."
"I would like to mention an example from the Russian Federation, where the oil lobby has brought about the closure of mines in the Vorkuta region, with disastrous social consequences."
"This must not happen in the EU."
"(ES) Madam President, in order to mitigate the social and energy impact and to ensure secure energy reserves, we have tabled three amendments in plenary with the following aims: firstly, for the overall volume of aid per year to diminish, but with no percentage limit or limit per business."
"In this respect, we are grateful for Mr Langen's position regarding removing fixed references and each Member State being able to decide according to their interests."
"The second aim is for aid to cover exceptional costs to be extended to 2030."
"Such proposals will help to alleviate the energy dependency of numerous EU countries, including Spain."
"They would ensure the continuation of indigenous production and the preservation of thousands of jobs on which significant regions of Spain and of Europe as a whole are largely dependent."
"(RO) Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Rapkay for all his efforts."
"I, too, think that it is of paramount importance for the transition period to be as long as possible - 2018, as has been proposed."
"I suggested longer still for the closure of uncompetitive mines or possibly for making some of them profitable, as the majority of the population in mining areas are involved in this activity."
"It is absolutely imperative to have plans for professional retraining and socio-economic recovery."
"Closing the mines prior to fully implementing these plans will result in extremely severe social problems A long time is required to implement plans for professional retraining and cleaning up these areas environmentally."
"During the current crisis in particular, it would be appropriate also to apply to the European Structural Funds, given the social, economic and environmental importance to the European Union."
"(RO) Madam President, our fellow Members in this Chamber have mentioned that this is a recurring debate in the European Parliament."
"It is indeed a recurring debate, but taking place in different economic and social conditions from before."
"We are in a global recession and the European Union is in crisis."
"No one believes that we have emerged from this crisis yet, with many Member States still facing the reality of recession."
"Under these circumstances, I do not believe that we - in this Parliament - need to contribute to the situation by adding a further 100 000 unemployed to those we currently have in the European Union."
"Secondly, we are discussing a new European energy strategy - another background factor."
"I believe that our approach in this new strategy must not be to increase our dependency on a single hydrocarbon source, but to increase our economic independence."
"Finally, the 21st century economy has been mentioned."
"I believe indeed that we need to be involved with this economy but, at the same time, we must focus on diversifying current potential."
"In this respect, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay."
"(PL) Madam President, in view of the specific nature of the regulation which we are debating, today, let us not forget that there are Member States of the European Union whose energy production is based mainly on coal."
"Therefore, the changes proposed during work on the regulation must be put into effect in a way which allows the speed of change to be adapted to the possibilities of absorption by the citizens and social structures."
"I welcome the compromise which has been achieved."
"In view of the role of coal in ensuring energy security, it is necessary to stabilise its extraction at the level required."
"The role of coal as a fuel in the energy balance will continue to be crucial for the energy sector by stabilising Europe's energy security."
"I hope the Council will share our concern and listen carefully to the position agreed by the European Parliament."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to refer briefly to two points."
"One of them concerns competitiveness, which is raised in a number of different areas of the report."
"I would like to ask you to remember how many mining accidents we hear about in the media."
"This is due to the fact that mining and, in particular, coal mining is going on all over the world, but unfortunately, the safety standards elsewhere are very low when compared with those in German or other European pits."
"This may seem like overstating the case, but personally, I do not think much of competitiveness which is bought at the expense of miners' lives."
"However, if we are looking at the consequences for industrial policy of an early exit from coal mining, I would like to say that the European mining equipment industry is competitive."
"I would like to invite all those people who believe that mining is an industry of the past and, in particular, Mr Klinz, to pay a visit to a mine."
"They will soon realise that mining uses high-tech solutions and that it is a question of whether or not we want this industry to continue to be profitable."
"I know that this is not what the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wants."
"I am afraid that the mining machinery industry will follow mining production and move out of Europe."
"Madam President, I repeat what I said in my opening speech: the Commission and I are taking very good note of all the arguments that have been put forward here by all of you, and we will take very good note of Parliament's position once Mr Rapkay's report is adopted."
"I think that we need to distinguish - as practically all the speeches have done - between coal as a primary energy source and the regulation to govern public aid for uncompetitive coal mines, which is a different thing."
"Our proposal, which we are debating today and which the Council will debate in the next few weeks, deals with the second issue, in other words, uncompetitive coal mining rather than the use of coal, which is a separate debate that we have had and will, of course, continue to have in Europe."
"Our position is that we need to bring an end to uncompetitive coal mining that requires continuous use of public subsidies, within a fixed period."
"This position is clear, and it is not the first time that it has been expressed."
"As some of you have recalled, it dates back a long way."
"The problem is that the deadlines that were established over time have not been respected by everyone."
"The aim of our proposal is to ensure that these deadlines are respected once and for all."
"This is a time when, unlike the context in which past debates took place, we have to take into consideration aid for coal mining."
"We need to take into account two additional issues."
"The first is the challenge of climate change, which we have debated on numerous occasions and for which the European Union has very specific targets."
"The second issue is the impact of the crisis and the resulting borrowing on government budgets, budgets at the national level, as this is placing even more pressure on public finances."
"These are not, however, the only issues that should be considered."
"We also have to consider - as you have in practically all your speeches - what the deadline should be for removing public aid for coal mining under non-competitive conditions."
"There is a debate around this issue, and we have listened to the different positions in the debate in Parliament."
"There is also a debate in the Council, and we are going to wait for the Council meeting at the beginning of December to see what the Council's position is."
"There has certainly been a debate in the Commission, and there will be another."
"As you know - as Mr Langen mentioned earlier - this is a Council regulation."
"Parliament's opinion is very important, but the treaty states that, on matters of public aid, the regulation is a Council regulation."
"The Council will establish its position."
"Currently - at the last meeting of the Permanent Representatives Committee - it has a majority position in favour of a deadline for the permanent removal of this aid in 2018, which is longer than the Commission's proposal."
"Our rules state, however, that unless the Council decides unanimously, the Commission proposal cannot be legally modified."
"Whatever decision the Council reaches, it is practically certain that it will not be unanimous, but the Commission is going to listen very carefully to the Council's position, just as it is listening very carefully to Parliament's arguments and will listen to Parliament's position when it votes."
"The Commission will adopt its final position based on its analysis of the respective positions of the Council, according to its prerogatives established in the treaty, and also of Parliament, and based on the debate on the Rapkay report."
"I just have to say that the Commission does not agree with the arguments in favour of unlimited aid for uncompetitive coal mining and would like to remind you that, if there were no new coal regulation based on the Commission's proposal, what would enter into force from 1 January 2011 would be the general State aid framework, which is considerably stricter than the Commission's proposal, the proposal that will emerge from the debates in the Council, or the opinion that will emerge from Parliament."
"Madam President, Mr Almunia, that is exactly the problem."
"You are right when you confirm to Mr Lange that it is a Council regulation."
"However, it also depends on whether the Commission hears the arguments put forward in the Council and here in Parliament."
"You must drop this very stringent proposal, as you have done, so that it is possible for a sensible, democratic approach to be taken, which involves a majority decision that does not require unanimity."
"I would like to make a second remark to Mr Chatzimarkakis."
"The review clause which you referred to is completely irrelevant in this case."
"The disputes which took place in Germany were only intended to save the face of the Minister for Economic Affairs there, nothing more."
"Now, I would like to look at the concern expressed by Mr Almunia."
"No one here and not even the report itself is questioning the fact that this is a phasing out arrangement, Mr Almunia."
"Whether it is sensible in terms of energy policy or technology is another question."
"What Mr Geier said is absolutely correct, but we are not calling that into question."
"The only question is whether we should do this relatively abruptly in 2014 or whether there are sensible transitional arrangements for 2018."
"Otherwise, we are not questioning anything."
"The situation is not as described by Mr Lambert, for example, who read out his speech and then left."
"He should have stayed here, because he might have learned something."
"It is not the case that there are Member States who have done nothing at all."
"That is not true of Spain, of Poland, of Romania or of Germany."
"In 1990, more than 200 000 people were working in the mining industry in Germany."
"Now, 20 years later, the figure is around 20 000."
"This represents a drop of 90%, leaving only 10% of the jobs still in place."
"There have been a number of pit closures between 2002 and the present day during the period of this regulation, which is still in force."
"Let us not behave as if nothing has happened."
"The question is whether or not we need a sensible transitional period to be able to achieve this without causing socio-political damage."
"I can only say, yes, we do need one."
"This four-year period should not be an issue, because no one is calling that into question anyway."
"Please take that message back to the Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11:30."
"(The sitting was suspended for a few minutes)"
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"While drafting this document, the rapporteur has achieved an important success - finding an answer to two questions: one concerning the environment and the other social protection."
"From Romania's perspective, and I believe that this is a point of view also shared by Germany, Poland, Spain or Hungary, the mining industry is an important component of the domestic economy."
"The coal mine closures may have a major social impact, contributing to the rise in unemployment and exacerbating the depopulation of regions which only have one industry - mining."
"At the same time, mine closures will also have a significant impact on the energy sector."
"I know that all these are arguments for and against this measure."
"However, the current reality leads us to a single conclusion: to extend the deadline for closing coal mines which are not competitive in order to support them in finding viable alternatives for all those involved in this sector."
"The European Commission is trying - at any price and in a way which is not justified by economic rationale - to reduce coal extraction."
"These efforts have been artificially stimulated by the increase in costs of generating energy in coal-fired power stations."
"I refer to the costs of emissions."
"It is a policy which undermines the economic foundations of those countries in which most energy is derived from coal."
"Such a strategy testifies to a lack of understanding of the need to have a coherent fuel and energy policy which prefers economic effectiveness and competitiveness."
"It also testifies to the lack of a unified energy policy guaranteeing security of energy supply and a lack of regulations based on uniform criteria for the entire common market, which would lead to fair competition while retaining minimum social costs."
"We are dealing, today, with a brutal violation of those principles."
"The question is, what kind of industry does the Union need - an industry which benefits the Union, or one which is supranational, corporate and which invests its taxes in tax havens?"
"Primary industries and power generation require many years of investment and concentration of capital, which means they need to be subsidised."
"Furthermore, they do not have to be profitable at any price."
"Cheap energy and fuel are essential for secondary industry to be competitive, including the machine industry."
"So we are talking about net profitability."
"I would like to say that the Union's economic problems during the crisis are not only the result of dishonest global financial speculations, but there is also a lack of a sound, uniform and fair industrial policy in the Union itself, particularly a fuel and energy policy."
"There are several arguments against such a rapid discontinuation of subsidies."
"I refer primarily to social and economic consequences on a regional scale."
"It is important that we spend subsidies to facilitate mine closures properly: to ensure that the employees concerned are retrained and redeployed in other sectors of the labour market."
"Appropriate environmental rehabilitation is also imperative."
"Without these, there is a risk that the EU will save less money on discontinued subsidies than it will have to spend on damage mitigation."
"It must be considered carefully whether it is useful to close coal mines at all, if all we achieve in doing so is that the remaining power plants must substitute domestic coal with coal imported from outside the common market."
"Is it expedient to close coal-fired power plants, one of the cheapest sources of electricity, when the alarming signs of energy shortage are beginning to be noticeable around the world?"
"We must also think of the increasing energy demands of the European Union, as well as the role of coal in energy security."
"We must not allow facilities like the Hungarian VÃ©rtes Power Plant and the OroszlÃ¡ny mine to close without carefully drafted and detailed plans."
"These plans must resolve the situation of the employees, the rehabilitation of the environment, and must demonstrate, through well-founded impact assessments, that closure is inevitable and represents the best option to reduce pollutant emissions."
"The green growth programme must not entail any measures that would cause severe economic and social problems."
"The European Union's attempt to reduce the use of coal is only right and proper."
"Since the longterm aim for Europe and the human race is nondependence on fossil fuels, we need to realise that European coal mines will, sooner or later, have to adapt to change."
"Globalisation means that there will be significant price pressures on coal."
"For this reason, production will transfer to countries where labour is cheaper and the areas in the EU where coal is produced will see jobs and income drain away, as mines can no longer respond to the competition."
"Although this is an unwelcome development, the actions of the authorities cannot conflict with the basic principles of the market economy."
"Unprofitable production should not be kept on a life support machine forever."
"We must remember that structural change on this scale will inevitably have farreaching and dramatic social consequences."
"Mine closures often mean the end of an area's main source of livelihood."
"This is reflected in the ability of cities and towns to provide their residents with services and the decline of entire communities."
"It is in everyone's interest if major social changes such as those associated with the gradual closure of mines take place with the right controls in place and over a sufficient period of transition."
"Coal will nevertheless play a key role in our lives in the foreseeable future."
"It will still be needed, for example, in the steel industry, and studies of its use as a raw material for polymers have been encouraging."
"Furthermore, an excellent costbenefit ratio has been achieved with combined heat and power using coal."
"We should not therefore succumb to the illusion that winding down coal mines is a sort of political end in itself."
"In the future, a profitable mining industry must be a possibility - in the EU too."
"There are various reasons for supporting coal aid: strategic reasons, regional sustainability reasons and social reasons."
"With regard to the strategic reasons, we need to take into account the fact that the market is changing rapidly."
"Therefore, abandoning coal without having a viable alternative would not be appropriate."
"The environmental argument is not relevant either, as imported coal is equally as polluting as indigenous coal."
"Moreover, we should not forget that, on many occasions, the mines from which we import coal do not comply with social rights."
"With regard to regional sustainability, in many cases, the mines are in sparsely populated areas that are entirely dependent on the industry to maintain the region, and we risk turning our lands into deserts."
"The final and most important reason is the more than 180 000 families that could be affected."
"In Spain, in my region of Aragon, we are pioneers of renewable energy sources, with almost 60% energy independence."
"The only resource that we can store is coal, and we need more time in order to improve our technologies and apply them to mining, thus transforming our indigenous coal into clean, sustainable coal."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11:05 pending voting time and resumed at 11:30)"
"Despite all the fine speeches on climate, Europe will still be clinging onto its coalblack past by adopting this report."
"Under the Europe 2020 strategy, the EU would like to move swiftly towards a low emissions future based on renewable forms of energy."
"These will merely be words, however, if, in the future, Parliament allows the Member States to squander billions on its coal mines."
"The current rules on aid would have expired in December, but in the Commission's proposals, they would be extended until 2014."
"The coalblack gloom is intensified by the fact that Parliament wants the rules on aid to be extended all the way to 2018."
"Two years ago, aid from the EU Member States to industry that produced and used hard coal, that is to say, anthracite, was as much as EUR 2.9 billion."
"That only shows that there is still many times more aid for fossil fuels than there is for renewable energy sources, and this despite the fact that our targets on climate would call for just the opposite policy."

"Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund: Noord Brabant and Zuid Holland, Division 18/Netherlands ("
"- Before the vote:"
"(NL) Mr President, the question of aid for the Netherlands from the European Solidarity Fund is, fortunately, still on today's agenda, but if it had been up to Mr Daul, my fellow Member from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), we would not be having this vote today, and the Netherlands would be being punished for rejecting the 6% increase to the EU budget and the introduction of European taxes."
"The delegation of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) finds it totally unacceptable that Mr Daul should have even entertained such an idea."
"This is a grave insult to the Netherlands as a Member State."
"It was precisely this point that was debated yesterday and the debate is closed."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the last Conference of Presidents, we decided to put the Matera report on today's agenda."
"No one asked for that report not to be put on the agenda."
"Therefore, the question asked by the President is as follows: faced with an individual such as this, are we going to be able to have frank discussions, as we have been used to having for five years?"
"That is the question I am going to ask on Thursday morning."
"Moreover, if the European Conservatives and Reformists continue to make this person participate in the Conference of Presidents, we are going to change the way we work."
"That is all I have to say."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are called upon to vote on a package of aid for Holland, which has requested the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for an overall sum of EUR 10.5 million."
"This transfer of internal funds to the Union budget can still be carried out under the ordinary procedure."
"Future requests for aid, and the number is growing steadily, risk being blocked, however, due to failure to approve the 2011 budget."
"If the twelfths system enters into force from January, it will not, in fact, be possible to make the transfers and proceed with the necessary payments."
"Under these particular circumstances, with Europe as a whole facing economic difficulties, Parliament hopes for a great sense of responsibility from Member States that have put up resistance in Council to approving an austerity budget that is in line with the prerogatives of the Treaty of Lisbon."

"- Before the vote:"

"However, since I feel it is much more important for the sector to have a long-term plan for anchovy fishing, I am going to vote in favour, and I am going to take this opportunity to ask the Council, which has so many reservations, to accept Parliament's codecision capacity granted by the Treaty of Lisbon and to please set a date today for negotiations to begin, because if this plan does not move forward, it is the sector that will suffer the most."

"I advocate that we vote against the PPE and that we adopt the Socialist report now that the Socialists have withdrawn the amendment, for reasons perhaps better known to some of those in the southern part of Europe."

"Formal sitting - Georgia"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, honoured guests and friends."
"I would like to extend a warm welcome to the President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili."
"(Applause)"
"This is not President Saakashvili's first visit to the European Parliament."
"He was with us four years ago, and he was also in Brussels in 2004, just after being elected President of Georgia."
"Today is a special day - today, 23 November, is the seventh anniversary of the Rose Revolution, the bloodless watershed which brought change to the situation not only in Georgia but the whole region of the South Caucasus."
"Mr President, for almost 60 years, the European Union has been moving in the direction which Georgia has now also chosen - that of lasting peace, welfare and unthreatened liberty."
"President Saakashvili received his initial education in Kiev."
"He then studied at European and American universities, and has always been associated with Strasbourg - he studied here, has received honours here and it was also here, as far as I know, that he met his future wife."
"So it is a special place for Mr Saakashvili."
"The last seven years have not been easy for Georgia."
"Georgia's territorial integrity has been violated."
"I would like to recall that in May this year, we adopted a resolution calling on Russia to respect the conditions of the ceasefire and to withdraw its forces from Georgian territory."
"(Applause)"
"Four years ago, Mr Saakashvili said in this Chamber that Georgians are not only one of the oldest nations of Europe, but that they are also intensely interested in European integration."
"They regard this as the kind of approach to international affairs which they prefer."
"I am sure this enthusiasm is no less today than four years ago."
"We, here in the European Parliament and the European Union, attach great importance to democratisation."
"The standards of democratisation and democracy are very high, and the standards of the free market are also high."
"Human rights, the rule of law and freedom of the press all require reforms - reforms of the constitutional system, electoral law and the justice system."
"A moment ago, I was talking about these matters with the President of Georgia, and we agreed that it is not an easy process, but that it is essential if we are to be similar to each other and if we are to work more easily with each other."
"I am pleased, too, that Georgia has quickly overcome the economic crisis."
"The European Union also played a part in this - we extended a helping hand."
"Today, Georgia is again at a stage of rapid economic growth."
"We in the European Union are keen that Georgia should be stable and that it should develop well, but we are also keen for this to happen in the entire region of the South Caucasus."
"Georgia could be the perfect model of transition to a democratic and free market system, full of protection for human rights and the operation of the rule of law."
"This is why what Mr Saakashvili has to propose to us and to say, today, is so important."
"We are glad you are with us, and we would like to ask you to speak."
"The floor is yours, Mr President."
"(Applause)"
"President of Georgia. - Mr President, I am humbled by the immense honour that your invitation signifies for my country, and I would like to thank you and all the political groups for this exceptional opportunity."
"Mr President, as we noted in our preliminary discussions, I was last here four years ago, so it is like the Olympic Games."
"I have come back four years later."
"Hopefully, I will perform better this time than last time."
"I came here to deliver a message of hope and to make a solemn pledge."
"I came here to affirm that peace - a just and lasting peace - is possible in my region, and that we need Europe to contribute to it."
"For centuries, the Caucasian Mountains have been a geopolitical mystery and a beguiling paradox: a region where individuals and souls were free, but where citizens were oppressed; where cultures were tolerant, but where governments created artificial divisions; where people never cease to feel deeply European, but where walls erected by empires turned Europe into a faraway mirage; where men and women were striving for peace, but wars seemed unavoidable."
"I came here to tell you that we must put an end to those times, that cooperation must replace rivalry, and that negotiations must prevail over the rhetoric of war."
"In all the troubled corners of our world, the European Parliament is a symbol of hope."
"It is striking proof that even the cruellest of conflicts can be overcome and that peace is worth any political risk."
"This very place would not exist if, in the middle of ruins, surrounded by death and legitimate claims for revenge, brave leaders did not choose to end centuries of wars by launching the most ambitious and fascinating political experiment of our time: European unification."
"This Parliament, which is divided not by nationality, but into political groups - fulfils the vision so eloquently expressed by Victor Hugo at the 1849 International Peace Congress in Paris."
"Allow me to quote the great poet in his own language:"
"(FR) The day will come when all of you, all the nations of the continent, without losing your distinctive qualities or your glorious individuality, merge into a greater union, and embody European fraternity."
"The day will come when the only battlefields are markets open to trade and minds open to ideas."
"The day will come when cannonballs and bombs are replaced by votes, by the universal suffrage of the peoples, by the venerable arbitration of a great sovereign senate which will be to Europe what Parliament is to the United Kingdom, what the Diet is to Germany and what the Legislative Assembly is to France."
"Most of Hugo's contemporaries thought he was an infantile dreamer, even when he gave this speech."
"It took more than a hundred years and two world wars for history to hear his voice."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for Hugo's voice to be echoed and heard in my region as well."
"It is high time for this voice of brotherhood to overcome the sounds of cannons and calls of hatred."
"It is high time for the European peace to be extended to the Caucasus."
"(Applause)"
"And it is our responsibility, as political leaders, to conceive bold initiatives in order to make this happen."
"Ladies and gentlemen, exactly seven years ago, the Rose Revolution initiated a new journey towards the European family of an old nation, my beloved Georgia."
"On 23 November 2003, hundreds of thousands of citizens of all regional, religious and social backgrounds peacefully took over the streets and the Parliament."
"Not a single window was broken and not a single thing was stolen from the building."
"They did more than overthrow a corrupt, backward-looking regime."
"They triggered what economists in London some weeks ago called a mental revolution."
"As some of you in this Assembly know well, there have been two ways of getting out from communist regimes after the liberating collapse of the USSR - the European one and the nationalistic one: the rule of law and the rule of fear."
"To sum up: VÃ¡clav Havel and Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ."
"Once the tyranny of the Party was over, the divisions, the corruption, the verticality, the bureaucracy, the cynicism and the authoritarianism that were the pillars of Soviet society remained intact."
"Seven years ago, Georgia was formally an independent state, but it was still part of this world of fear and hatred."
"The borders of the Soviet mentality were not abolished, and the Soviet Union still existed in the minds and the souls of the people."
"Only a mental revolution could lead to the European transformation of our societies."
"This is the message that we Georgians brought to this region."
"This is the message that unleashed so much anger towards us among those nostalgic for the Empire, but this is the message that turned Georgia into a laboratory of reforms for our region."
"When we led the Rose Revolution, we were members of student organisations, opposition parties and civil society groups, all united by a single dream: to turn a dysfunctional post-Soviet country crippled beyond imagining by corruption and crime into a European democracy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Soviet Union was based on the principle of the right to rule."
"People were artificially opposed to each other at every level of society and in every field."
"In every republic, the different religious, social and ethnic groups were made to be constant rivals, and politics was understood as an art of manipulation, fear and hatred."
"This explains why former communist leaders turned so easily into nationalists - in the Balkans as well as in the Caucasus, in eastern Europe as well as in Russia."
"Seven years ago, Georgia was still divided into isolated communities which feared each other."
"Some extremists were using the weakness of the State to reject minorities."
"Our first task was therefore to embrace multiculturalism and differences."
"We have developed an affirmative action programme in all spheres, from higher education to law enforcement bodies."
"The Soviet Union had another characteristic - absolute centralisation."
"Seven years ago, Georgia was still centred completely on its capital, and we initiated a vast decentralisation programme, invested in regional development infrastructures and spectacularly empowered local authorities."
"As a result, regions that were once abandoned became the most striking examples of our development."
"Until the Rose Revolution, all key regional principles were appointed by the President, so while others were restoring the famous vertical power cancelling the autonomy of all the regions, we systematically transferred power to regionally elected bodies."
"This policy has recently led to the first direct election of the mayor of the capital Tbilisi - last May - and the decision to move the Constitutional Court to the city of Batumi and the Parliament to Georgia's second-biggest city - Kutaisi - in the centre of Georgia."
"The Soviet Union was all about control and corruption - an overweight and inefficient state."
"Our first step was therefore to dissolve the KGB and fire the entire police force ..."
"(Applause)"
"... as well as customs officers and tax agents, but also to open our economy and our educational system."
"The vision that guided all these steps was captured by a single symbol."
"Beside every Georgian flag in every official building, we installed a European flag."
"We did this to show where we were aiming to take Georgia with our reforms."
"Of course, our peaceful revolution has had its share of failures and shortcomings."
"Of course, we have made mistakes but, as the great inventor of European cosmopolitanism and one of my favourite philosophers, Immanuel Kant, wrote about the French revolution, 'You cannot be ready to be free until you are actually free'."
"What Immanuel Kant meant, ladies and gentlemen, is that no book can teach you in advance how to govern - or even behave - in freedom."
"You can only learn this from your own successes and failures."
"We have had failures and we have learnt from them, but we have also had surprising successes."
"Georgia has just been singled out by the World Bank as the number one economic reformer in the world over the last five years and now ranks twelfth in the world and number one in central and eastern Europe - and certainly in the post-Soviet world - for ease of doing business."
"Once the epicentre of the post-Soviet mafia, Georgia made more progress against corruption than any other country in the world from 2004 to 2009, according to the EBRD and Transparency International."
"Indeed, on the TI listing, Georgia went up about 70 places and, by coincidence, around that time, Russia went down about 70 places."
"We met in the middle and I do not remember them saying hello, but that is what happened."
"I value these rankings only because they reflect and rebuild the social and moral transformation that happened in my country - the mental revolution to which I referred earlier."
"Georgian citizens have stopped thinking of their state and country as a post-Soviet state."
"They see it, judge it and criticise it as a European democracy."
"Such a change goes far beyond the leaders and parties that led the Rose Revolution."
"It is something that nobody owns and nobody can suppress, neither us nor anybody else."
"Such a revolution leads to this amazing fact in our part of the world: that institutions are systematically more popular than political figures."
"We just had a huge police reform and, according to the last poll we took - a Gallup poll - the police came out with an 86% confidence rating, a figure which used to be 5%."
"The same for the Presidency, the same for Parliament, the same for other institutions in the country: it was exactly the inverse of what happened previously."
"That really tells you that the institutions are more popular than the leaders and that the country is moving in the right direction."
"There is a great deal more to do."
"Obviously, we are more committed than ever to pursuing our paths of reform."
"We are aware that democracies are always a work in progress."
"Of course, our alternative democratic model was not welcomed by everybody."
"It met fierce opposition among those revisionist forces who still perceive the fall of the USSR as the worst catastrophe of the 20th century."
"They imposed a full-scale embargo on my nation in 2006."
"Before that, there was a full-scale energy embargo in 2005."
"They deported our citizens, repeatedly bombed our territory prior to 2008 and finally invaded in 2008."
"As I speak, these forces still occupy 20% of Georgian territory, in blatant violation of international law and of the 12 August ceasefire agreement brokered thanks to the efforts of my good friend and great European leader, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who was then President of the European Union."
"As I speak, Georgia still has up to 500 000 IDPs and refugees who cannot return home because some people, animated by an old imperialist mentality, decided to welcome the 21st century by organising ethnic cleansing campaigns and building a new Berlin Wall dividing my country."
"How did we respond to these aggressions?"
"First, we fully implemented the ceasefire agreement and went beyond our obligations, without once using Russia's refusal to comply as a pretext."
"Last August, the Head of the European Union Monitoring Mission, HansjÃ¶rg Haber - a German - publicly praised Georgian restraint and our engagement strategy as constructive unilateralism."
"When tanks and missiles are standing 50 km from a capital, it would be high time for many governments to cry that they are besieged, there is no time to have freedom and it is a luxury to have democracy - which they cannot afford - and start to crack down on their opposition and call for so-called unity of society."
"We did exactly the opposite."
"We are building, in these circumstances, democracy at gunpoint."
"In front of the iron curtain which the occupation forces have built around the region of Abkhazia, in the small seaside town of Anaklia, which was a violent no man's land just a few years ago, a new tourist resort is being built as we speak, with beautiful hotels and sandy beaches."
"Some suggest that we should stop and wait until the situation is resolved and only start building when the ground is more solid, less shaky and less dangerous."
"Our philosophy is the complete opposite."
"We are constructing buildings not because they are on strong and solid ground but because by building them, we will eventually make the ground stronger."
"In Anaklia, a new phase of development started in 2005 after it had already been destroyed twice by the conflict, in 1993 and 1998."
"In 2008, it once again witnessed total destruction."
"All the new buildings were burnt down by invading Russian troops, including discos, cafÃ©s, youth hostels and other hotels."
"A few weeks later, construction started again."
"A great poet and a famous Russian dissident, Alexandr Galich, one of those eight heroes who demonstrated on Red Square in 1968 against the invasion of Prague, was the author of this great phrase: ÐÑÐµÑÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ð² Ð¾Ð¿Ð°ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑÐ¸!"

"The last time I visited Anaklia, I saw a row of discotheques as lively as you can see anywhere in Europe, where young people danced just as they would in Ibiza or St Tropez."
"The only difference was that the '18' Disco where we went was the last disco on the beach."
"Exactly five metres from there is a wall beyond which the occupying army is stationed, and then there is almost 100 km of darkness and emptiness."
"Let me ask you: what is more absurd than a new Berlin Wall on a sandy subtropical Black Sea beach?"
"In short, we understand that peace is in our supreme interest, and we are convinced that there is no alternative to peace."
"By jeopardising peace, we would place at risk everything we have achieved and everything we want to achieve in the coming years."
"I have come here to announce a new step in our policy of constructive unilateralism."
"I am here to take an initiative that I hope, with your help, will defuse the tensions and allow serious negotiations to start."
"Before coming, I reflected a lot."
"I also consulted with our friends - American and European allies and people in the region - and the Georgian Government already considers itself bound by the 12 August ceasefire agreement and has always understood that the ceasefire clearly prohibits the use of force."
"But in order to prove that Georgia is definitely committed to a peaceful resolution of its conflict with the Russian Federation, we are today taking the unilateral initiative of declaring that Georgia will never use force to roll back the Russian occupation and to restore its control over the occupied areas."
"It will only resort to peaceful means in its quest for de-occupation and reunification."
"Even if the Russian Federation refuses to withdraw its occupation forces, even if its proxy militias multiply their human rights violations, Georgia will only retain the right to self-defence in the case of new attacks and invasion of the 80% of the Georgian territory that remains under the control of the Georgian Government."
"I will address the relevant letters to the Secretary-General of the UN, the Secretary-General of the OSCE and the leadership of the European Union, stating clearly that we commit ourselves not to use force in order to restore control of all our illegally divided country, neither against the occupation forces nor against their proxies - even though the UN Charter might allow us to do so."
"My pledge here before you constitutes a unilateral declaration of a state under international law."
"This initiative is far from easy for a country that is partially occupied and has 500 000 IDPs and refugees."
"It constitutes and expands our policy of constructive unilateralism."
"I am ready for deep, comprehensive dialogue with my Russian counterpart."
"We will, of course, continue to participate in the Geneva talks, hoping that our pledge today will persuade the Russian Federation to stop blocking these discussions."
"But we need political dialogue to start as well."
"For this to occur, the international community must make it clear to the Russian leaders that the situation today is totally irregular and unsustainable."
"In order to push them to discuss a compromise, it is essential clearly to state the reality of the situation on the ground."
"This is why we are asking that the Russian military build-up within the international borders of Georgia be qualified as illegal occupation of a sovereign territory."
"Many European nations, as well as the United States, have already done so."
"Because if this is not a military occupation, then what is it?"
"Is it military tourism when you have tens of thousands of troops, missiles and tanks deployed illegally against you, and a part is removed from your populated territory?"
"Equally, the brutal campaigns that have expelled hundreds of thousands of Georgian citizens from the occupied territories should be qualified as illegal acts of ethnic cleansing."
"If we fail to denounce this ethnic cleansing, why would the occupiers ever even consider allowing them to return back to their homes, towns and villages?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, if the first victim of war is always the truth, the truth is always the most solid foundation of peace."
"Our constructive unilateralism and the pledge I have just made will not have the expected impact if our European friends do not speak out the truth."
"If you do not speak out the truth, then who will?"
"I came here today humbly to tell you that, basically we - and maybe the whole region - depend on you."
"Ladies and gentlemen, our region has known too many wars in recent history."
"It is time - to paraphrase Hugo once again - to replace cannons with round tables."
"Our region has had its own Warsaw, its own Coventry, its own Oradour-sur-Glane, and it is time to build on our common rejection of war and destruction."
"It is time to say that we must never have another Grozny, a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants that has been totally erased from the surface of the globe."
"It is time to say that we must never again see people expelled from their homes and deported on the basis of their nationality, faith or origin, as happened in my own country as well as in other countries in the region."
"I am ready to work with the Russian leadership to ensure that this does not happen again and that the consequences of the war are reversed and conditions for peace established."
"Walls like the one dividing Georgia will not be brought down by bombs but by the commitment of citizens to build a free, united, democratic country and by the commitment of the world community to enforce international law, and this is the ambition we will never give up."
"We will never give up our ambition to reunite our country and establish it as a free democratic nation by peaceful means."
"It is noticeable that, despite the enormous pressure and multiple threats from Moscow, not a single former Soviet Republic has recognised this dismemberment of Georgia."
"It shows - to the great surprise and fury of some people - that the old times are definitely over."
"It shows that the former captive nations of Soviet times have, with all the hurdles and problems, become strong independent states that determine their own policies."
"No one, in short, is going back to the USSR."
"Ladies and gentlemen, our region has made a choice."
"A war has been launched to stop this movement, but tanks cannot reverse the sense of history, and it is time for the long and dolorous hangover of imperialism to end peacefully."
"I call, therefore, on the Russian leaders to make the choice of the future."
"They could play such a major positive role in the ongoing transformation of our common region, accepting other countries as partners and not as vassals."
"We all want - and I personally want - Russia as a partner and not as an enemy."
"Nobody has a greater interest than us in seeing Russia turn into a country that truly operates within the concert of nations, respects international law, and - this is often connected - upholds basic human rights."
"This is why I wholeheartedly support the efforts of European and American leaders to engage Russia in a more constructive relationship."
"Our conflict has done nothing to harden feelings between our two peoples;"
"I want to tell the Russian people that they will always be welcome in Georgia as partners, tourists, students, businessmen, journalists or simply as friends - but not as occupation forces."
"(Great applause from the floor)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to end this speech with a quote from the President of the first Georgia Republic, Noe Zhordania."
"As you might know, Georgia was the first European social democratic republic ever proclaimed in 1918, and we are very proud of this."
"We have strong women's rights and other strong social rights enshrined in the constitution."
"A few days before the Red Army invaded Georgia, Zhordania explained our European choice: 'What do we take from the cultural bow of European nations?"
"More than 2 000 years of national culture, a democratic system and natural wealth'."
"Russia offered us the chance to go back and have military lives."
"We told Russia that we are going to Europe, and we want Russia to go together with us towards Europe."
"Today, another Georgian President is addressing you with the same message of love for European ideas and values."
"It is rare that a nation is given the same opportunity twice in history."
"I came here today to tell you that we will seize this opportunity and do whatever we can to achieve our European destiny."
"President Saakashvili, your message today was very important for all of us, but it was very important as well for the future OSCE summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, in one week's time on 1 and 2 December."
"First of all, it was of crucial importance to the whole of your region, to the Caucasus, both the southern Caucasus and the northern Caucasus."
"We have always known that you are brave men - now we can also say that you are prudent men."
"Courage and prudence should always go together."

"Civil, commercial, family and private international law aspects of the action plan implementing the Stockholm Programme ("
"- Before the vote:"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, due to the change in the agenda approved yesterday by this House, I would firstly like to express my approval for the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs has unanimously approved the draft report that we are voting on today."
"The fact that the construction of the European judicial space finds such a broad consensus in Parliament is important."
"The Stockholm Programme envisages that everyday life should be intrinsic to the process of constructing a Europe of citizens and not merely of political forces or institutional representations."
"It sets out to resolve the everyday problems of Europeans by the real and unified creation of an effective market of labour, goods and services, entrepreneurial activity without internal borders and without red tape, to strengthen the common basis of rights of succession, contracts, consumers, timely payments, the family, children and more."
"It will also be the duty and responsibility of the justice system, national judiciaries, solicitors, accountants and workers who operate within individual States to build Europe, to interpret the laws that unite our continent."
"Our past is marked by different judicial and legal traditions - Common law and Civil law - with differences between the French or German systems and histories that are sometimes very different."
"We respect national prerogatives and the principle of subsidiarity, but we realise that in order to build Europe - and fortunately we are still on that road - we need progressive convergence that is based on the great constitutional tradition of fundamental rights for which Europe stands."
"Mr President, the Action Plan that we will approve sets out to construct, reinforce, extend and disseminate a solid European judicial culture, a European legal mindset."
"That is why I will vote in favour."
"Voting time (continuation)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"Mr President, would you trust an economic forecaster who had recently said this: 'The euro has done more to enforce budgetary discipline in the rest of Europe than any number of exhortations from the IMF or the OECD'?"
"Or this: 'The euro has already provided great internal stability for the eurozone'?"
"Or this: 'If we get rid of sterling and adopt the euro, we will also get rid of sterling crises and sterling over-valuations."
"This will give us a real control over our economic environment'."
"All three of those quotations come from our former colleagues in this House, Nick Clegg and Chris Huhne - now, alarmingly, ministers in the British Government."
"We, on the other hand, who oppose the euro - there is no way of putting this modestly - have been proved absolutely right."
"We always said that an ECB rate determined by the needs of the core would be disastrous for the periphery."
"I am not expecting any humility from those who got it so disastrously wrong."
"I am sure they will still be wheeled out by the BBC as disinterested experts, and I am sure that we will still be portrayed as doctrinaire hardliners."
"Believe me, I am not gloating for the sake of it."
"A friend of mine just said that there is nothing more irritating than being wise during the event."
"But please listen to us next time."
"The single currency forces nations to adopt the wrong monetary policy, with calamitous outcomes for the bailout receivers and to those paying."
"Mr President, I share the concern my colleague just expressed about this obsession with harmonisation."
"When we look at the moves towards a common VAT tax base, we hear MEPs across this House arguing for more and more harmonisation when it comes to tax, forgetting that what we really need here at EU level is more tax competition."
"We also need this at global level to ensure that when it comes to the economy and economic competitiveness, we are not taxing our citizens out of productive capability and productive forces - what we are actually doing is ensuring that we have enough entrepreneurs and innovators in a country, and one of the best ways we can do that is by tax competition."
"This obsession with harmonisation has led us to a single currency that does not take account of national differences and differences in economic cycles."
"This is why countries are suffering; this is partly why Ireland is suffering; and it is time we moved more towards competition, rather than to common tax bases."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report examines the annual report and the activity carried out this year."
"Economic and financial and, to a growing extent, political actions are still extensively dominated by the international financial crisis."
"Events in Greece and in other countries of the area naturally have complex causes."
"The problems are largely of internal origin because they stem from a lack of structural reforms."
"Without a shadow of a doubt, the European monetary union has not operated in the way it was designed to work."
"The principles of the Stability and Growth Pact have not always been respected and infringements that seemed minor initially have proven, over time, to be a serious threat to the pact as a whole."
"We must therefore learn a lesson from the situation."
"We need to re-balance the European monetary union, achieve greater transparency and more effective management of the crisis in the financial markets and rebuild public trust from the bottom."
"This is an enormous challenge, but also an opportunity that we have a duty to grasp."
"Mr President, we can see the way in which the Irish Republic has been brought to its present predicament by the euro."
"As early as 2001, Irish economists were alarmingly warning that Ireland desperately needed to raise interest rates to choke off the unsustainable boom."
"But of course, there were no Irish interest rates; there was only the European Central Bank, which, by giving the core members what they needed, was giving the peripheral members a double dose of what they did not need, namely, artificially cheap money."
"The problems of Ireland are going to carry on for as long as it is in the single currency."
"The bailout may allow it to limp on until the next time that its monetary policy needs to diverge from those of the rest of the eurozone."
"It is crazy, at a time like this, when my own country already owes GBP 850 billion, that we should be borrowing another GBP 7 billion to send to Ireland."
"That money will not only be useless, it will be actively harmful because it will trap the Republic of Ireland in its present discontents."
"If we want to be helpful, we could offer our friends and neighbours the far more immediate and practical assistance of allowing them a temporary currency union with sterling, allowing them to treat their loans as being denominated in pounds, and allowing them then to export their way back to growth."
"(FI) Mr President, I would like to emphasise the importance of training."
"In other respects, this motion for a resolution is excellent, but I would like to point out that, from the perspective of gender, the EU and other countries involved in these civil crisis management operations would do well to look to the north and learn a lesson from Sweden and Finland too where it concerns training."
"I would also like to stress that it is very important that cooperation actually works and that we also conduct surveys and studies on how well these operations have succeeded."
"There are still flaws in the system at the moment."
"Mr President, I want to explain the reason why I voted against Amendments 30 and 31 to Article 5 of the Gallagher report: for the very simple reason that it would separate the Bay of Biscay TAC from the rest of the area."
"The justification was simply that there are many small local fishing boats in that particular region that do not have a big impact on the stocks of mackerel in the waters."
"The argument I would make is that every coastal community, virtually in every country, could make the same argument in order to protect the interests of their fishermen."
"The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee does not seem to suggest that we can separate the fish stocks in the waters."
"Fish are a transient species, they move around, and this separation is not in accord with the Lisbon Treaty."
"The plan for the long-term management of the stocks within the North Atlantic should not be fiddled with."
"If we have a common fisheries policy, it should be common for all, no exceptions, no exemptions, and the long-term consequences of this are quite serious."
"(ES) Mr President, I voted in favour of Amendments 30 and 31, because both the distribution by area of total allowable catches (TACs) and the establishment of TACs need to take into account the characteristics and objectives of the different fleets - small-scale and industrial fleets - so that the fishing opportunities that they have had until now can be maintained."
"Changing them could mean changes in the fishing framework, and could even cause disputes with local fisheries, which mainly use horse mackerel to provide quality fish to the public."
"TACs need to be differentiated by area, both in the case of horse mackerel, and in the case of other fish populations that are also covered by the common fisheries policy."
"(PL) Mr President, the problem of declining fish stocks is affecting not only us Europeans, but also fishermen and consumers throughout the world."
"The lack of suitable fishing grounds is a threat to food security."
"It may also upset the balance of aquatic ecosystems and, as a result, of the entire environment of our planet."
"In relation to climate change, the Baltic Sea is particularly at risk of the disappearance of certain species of fish, and errors in European fisheries legislation, which imposes bans on fishing, are exacerbating this situation."
"This is why it is so important to carry out an appropriate revision of the common fisheries policy, which guarantees sustainable fishing in the waters of our region."
"I endorsed the report for these reasons."
"(FI) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report."
"I, too, am concerned that we need to ensure that fish stocks last and that fishing is genuinely sustainable, in the Baltic Sea region too."
"The reduction in fish stocks is currently a major cause for concern."
"Here, obviously, the focus was mainly on flounder and turbot, and this was clearly a technical reform in the main, one which was needed when the Treaty of Lisbon had entered into force."
"In other words, the old system was being sanctioned."
"The scope of this debate should now be widened."
"I am concerned about wild salmon stocks, especially in the Baltic region, and I think that we should ensure that these stocks could also be reestablished there and that we should start to give serious attention to making sure that fishing in the Baltic Sea is practised in a sustainable manner."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal that introductions and translocations involving the use of closed aquaculture facilities should be exempted from the permit requirement was bound to be accompanied by a more rigorous definition of the requirements that these facilities must observe."
"I therefore lent my full support to the report by Mr Ferreira."
"I would nevertheless like to take this opportunity to emphasise the lack of adequate support for scientific research and technological development in the field of native species rearing."
"Greater support for this sector is essential to the sustainable development of European agriculture."
"Only in this way will we be able to diversify food production and supply, guaranteeing an improvement in quality and greater environmental safety."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market is one of the pillars of the European Union."
"There is no doubt that, under the same general conditions, enterprises can produce and sell their products and services without public support, but not all sectors and not all areas are operating under conditions of parity."
"It is therefore fair, as in this instance, to correct situations of economic disadvantage and allow productive businesses to remain on the market and maintain employment levels, as in Sulcis for example, where 500 families would have found themselves without work, without income and without dignity."
"We must realise that when we speak of coal, we are talking about areas that have no alternative to mines and should be allowed the opportunity to adopt production technologies that are competitive and compatible with the free market and with the environment."
"Logically, postponing the deadline to 2018 must represent an imperative to ensure that institutions and companies take immediate action to develop technological, financial and environmental compatibility conditions that are in line with the challenges that await us."
"(FI) Mr President, when we speak about State aid, we also need to remember that, in some cases, it can distort competition."
"When, in the context of the Single Market, there is talk specifically about coal mines and aid for them, it has to be said that we in Europe should be looking at a more sustainable future."
"Coal is now one of the most harmful fossil fuels: it actually kills hundreds of thousands of animals over the course of a year as a result of different emissions."
"For that reason, I hope that we in Europe will achieve a situation where we could gradually reduce the use of coal as a source of energy and switch to renewable energy sources."
"I understand that it will mean that there will have to be a period of transition of some kind in areas where coal production is closely linked to employment, but basically, we should be moving more in the direction of renewable technology and energy."
"(FI) Mr President, I do not think that the EU should support polluting coal mines."
"We should be supporting the acquisition of renewable energy and its production."
"We cannot put our foot down on the accelerator and apply the brakes at the same time."
"I am with the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on this matter, but in the final vote, I made a mistake."
"I formally corrected it, but I also wanted to say so here."
"(PL) Mr President, I am speaking because Poland is one of those countries which have had to face the biggest problems in terms of a sudden reduction in expenditure and extraction potential in the coal industry."
"Ten years ago, we introduced a radical programme of mine closures, but to replace the Polish coal, 10 million tonnes of Russian coal is being imported."
"I want to give my assurance that the emission of CO2 from Polish coal is the same as from Russian coal."
"However, it is good that we have a national aid programme and that the Commission allows this."
"I endorsed this report."
"However, I am of the opinion that we do have to maintain a balance."
"The objective is not to close mines just for the sake of closing mines; it is to ensure energy security - and we are treating mines as if they were businesses."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has succeeded in establishing itself as a key player in international North-South cooperation due to the quality of its work."
"Strengthening the parliamentary dimension of cooperation proved essential for the purposes of guaranteeing good deployment of funds, satisfying people's needs and achieving the Millennium Development Goals with regard to health and education."
"Some time ago, the European Commission introduced the practice of subjecting national and regional strategy papers to parliamentary scrutiny by both the European Parliament and national parliaments."
"I voted in favour of this report because I intend to support the work carried out to date by this House, a role that is even more important today as we oversee negotiations over economic partnership agreements."
"In 2009, the European Commission submitted, together with the ACP countries, certain proposals for a second review of the partnership agreement and I hope that we can guarantee its survival and development as an essential institution in this process of cooperation and democratisation of the rest of the world."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mrs Joly on her report."
"Today, we inhabit a world where human history seems to be travelling along separate tracks."
"In some continents, the days are spent basking in the light of innovation, technology and objective wellbeing while, in others, people spend their hours, from dawn to dusk, in a desperate search for the minimal means of survival."
"In 2009, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly strove actively to ensure that its numerous proposals could be translated into substantial commitments and goals to be achieved."
"The European Union proved itself resolved to undertake timely, targeted and coordinated action to support the hardest hit countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable."
"On 1 December, the twentieth ACP-EU plenary session will be held in Kinshasa."
"During this, an important report on the Millennium Development Goals will be discussed."
"As rapporteur and also deputy chair of the assembly, I will be fully committed to ensuring that the measures adopted are not empty words but become a solid commitment to continuing along the path towards a fairer world and, above all, a world without poverty."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has proved itself an essential tool for building an open and democratic dialogue, successfully involving ACP national parliaments, local authorities and non-governmental organisations."
"I agree on the general approach of the report, and consider the invitation to the Commission to provide greater information to the parliaments of ACP countries to be particularly useful."
"It is essential to actively involve these parliaments in preparing national development strategies."
"I give my support to Mrs Joly."
"Before we can talk about establishing a tax on international financial transactions, though, we need to carry out a study on its potential impact."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Stockholm Programme adopted by the European Council in December last year, is to create a European space of freedom, safety and justice, to be achieved over the next five years, with the aim of ensuring that citizens can enjoy all their fundamental rights."
"The ultimate aim of Union law must therefore be to facilitate mobility and to guarantee that these same citizens can create a European judicial space as quickly as possible."
"The action plan proposed by the European Commission envisages a set of measures that stem from the new instruments made available by the Treaty of Lisbon for the purposes of reconciling the needs of citizens of the single market with the different judicial traditions of Member States."
"I voted in favour of this report because, having stated the necessary premises, it calls on Member States to commit themselves actively to its implementation, emphasising the sectors that must be treated as a priority, namely, civil aspects, mutual recognition of official documents and judgments, a common framework of reference, debtors' assets and common judicial training"
"I emphasise once again my conviction that the European Parliament must be associated with this process of harmonisation after a careful examination of the legal systems in force at national level."
"Nowadays, the harmonisation of legal systems and the respective scope of civil and criminal law on numerous matters is correlated with and has become an integral part of discussions in international trade negotiations because it raises a set of legal questions that have not yet been resolved."
"(NL) Mr President, European cooperation in the area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ) remains a sensitive issue and one which needs to be addressed carefully."
"Cooperation between judicial authorities may be necessary in order to prevent crime and bring justice and legal certainty to the European internal market."
"However, cooperation within the framework of AFSJ carries with it the hidden risk that Europe will occupy itself with matters which actually fall within national competence."
"Paragraph 40 of the Berlinguer report emphasises mutual recognition of marriage and family law without any reference to Article 81(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"This article states that each Member State shall remain sovereign in matters of family law with cross-border implications."
"I have declined to endorse this report, both because this European principle has not been explicitly observed and because the European Conservatives and Reformists' amendment in that regard has been rejected."
"(SK) Mr President, I abstained from the vote because I am not convinced that Member State subsidiarity is respected in the area of family law."
"The European Union must fully respect the division of powers between the Union and the Member States when creating legislation."
"For this reason, I fully support an approach which consistently takes account of the various legal approaches and constitutional traditions based on the specific conditions of individual states, particularly in areas relating to the fundamental values of a given society, such as the values embodied in family law legislation."
"The aim of the EU approach should be to better understand and secure the needs of all citizens in all states, and not to create some kind of monochrome society."
"It is therefore essential not to overstep by force the necessary framework of the measure, which might threaten the fundamental values of the Member States in specific areas of civil and family law."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to say that coal is a raw material which is very important for the welfare of society and energy security."
"Despite research which has been carried out and despite the search for alternative energy sources, demand for coal continues to rise."
"It is obvious, therefore, that efforts should be made to ensure permanent access to coal reserves."
"However, when a mine becomes unprofitable, keeping it in operation with the use of State aid upsets the market, interferes with competitiveness and destabilises, as a result, the economy of the country concerned."
"What is needed, therefore, is suitable legislation enabling the effective and also the safe closure of such a mine."
"The draft regulation ensures achievement of these objectives, guaranteeing to maintain the competitiveness of the energy market and to stimulate the development of closely related industries."
"Needless to say, I endorsed the report."
"Written explanations of vote"
"I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague, Mr BÃ¶ge, on the proposal for a decision on mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund to the tune of EUR 13 million in order to help Ireland, which was hit by serious floods in November 2009."
"The amount of aid seems derisory to me (2.5% of an estimated EUR 500 million of total damage), and it has come far too late."
"I suggest that we ask ourselves whether, rather than granting derisory sums, we ought not to use part of them to finance a European civil protection force to come to the aid of States that are stricken by disasters that they are not equipped to deal with (fires, floods, natural disasters, cross-border disasters, and so on), or to carry out international cooperation efforts in the event of serious disasters such as that which occurred in Haiti, for example."
"I strongly agree with what the report says about supporting the Commission's decision to allocate EUR 13.02 million from the EU Solidarity Fund for the benefit of Ireland in order to restore infrastructure and to implement flood prevention measures in affected areas."
"The floods in Ireland in November 2009 did considerable damage to homes, farms, businesses, infrastructure, roads and water sources in affected areas."
"This money from the Commission will help defray some of the costs that arose at the time of the crisis."
"The extent to which this money is directed to investment for putting measures in place to prevent flooding in the areas concerned is also extremely important."
"I voted to provide funds from the EU Solidarity Fund to Ireland."
"In 2009, heavy rain led to severe flooding which caused serious damage to the agricultural sector, residential properties and businesses, to the road network and other infrastructure."
"Support for Ireland was approved by way of exception because the extent of the damage caused by the floods did not meet Solidarity Fund requirements."
"With the changing climate in Europe and throughout the world, there is an increasing number of natural disasters resulting in loss of human life and major damage."
"The European Union must therefore establish measures to provide the required funding in a timely manner when such disasters occur."
"In its March resolution, the European Parliament clearly expressed its position that in order to solve the problems caused by natural disasters more effectively, there needs to be a new Solidarity Fund regulation."
"I believe that the review of the regulation must aim to establish a stronger and more flexible measure, the application of which would enable us to react more effectively to the new challenges of climate change and to swiftly deliver aid to the victims of natural disasters."
"in writing. - Considering the illegitimacy, undemocratic structure, corruption and megalomaniac ulterior motivation of the European Union in general and the Commission, in particular, we of the UKIP cannot condone the Commission's monopolisation of public funds for any purpose whatever and believe, consequently, that any monies it directs to the repair of last year's flood damage in Ireland will not be properly used and will merely conceal the need for relief funding that is correctly disbursed and directed by democratically elected governments."
"The European Union Solidarity Fund, which is intended to help countries forced to cope with natural disasters, has been mobilised 33 times since its creation eight years ago."
"It has proved its usefulness, and mobilising it for the November 2009 floods in Ireland, which everyone remembers, is, in my view, entirely justified."
"in writing. - (BG) I would like to explain why I voted in favour of this proposal."
"I believe it absolutely necessary for us to show understanding towards problems such as this, as something like this could happen to any one of us."
"By acting in this way, we show our unity and empathy at times of natural disasters."
"I am certain that our aid will be spent in the best way possible and will help overcome the consequences of the flooding in Ireland."
"I regard Ireland's application for assistance from the Solidarity Fund following the torrential rain which led to major flooding in November 2009 as important and welcome."
"The flooding caused severe damage to the agricultural sector, residential properties and businesses, to the road network and other infrastructures."
"Overall, I voted in favour of this report, given that Ireland has submitted a request for assistance and the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund to respond to a disaster caused by severe flooding in November 2009, and due to the fact that this flooding caused considerable damage to many homes, farms, roads and water supply networks, and that the financial aid provided under the fund will enable the Irish authorities to recoup some of the costs incurred in responding to the emergency."
"I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund in favour of Ireland following the floods that caused severe damage to the agricultural sector, homes and businesses, the road network and other infrastructure."
"Although the total losses remain below the normal threshold, the request made by Ireland falls under the criterion of 'extraordinary regional disaster', which sets out the conditions for mobilising the Solidarity Fund 'under exceptional circumstances'."
"It would be desirable for the Council to unblock the new regulation on the Solidarity Fund, which has been approved by Parliament."
"As I stated previously, I believe that solidarity among EU Member States and, in particular, European support for states affected by disasters, is a clear sign that the EU is no longer just a free trade area."
"At a time when many are questioning the soundness of our joint project, special aid instruments such as the European Union Solidarity Fund show that we are capable of remaining united in adversity, even in situations that place high demands on human and material resources."
"The floods that took place in November 2009 seriously affected Ireland and caused severe damage estimated at more than EUR 520 million."
"I therefore believe that the mobilisation of the fund is fully justified in order to help those who have suffered most from this natural disaster, and I congratulate the chair of the Committee on Regional Development for the speed with which she issued its opinion, thereby avoiding undue delays in the parliamentary procedure."
"This report allows for the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund (ESF) to help Ireland address the disaster caused by heavy rain and flooding in 2009. This flooding caused severe damage to the agricultural sector, homes and businesses, the road network and other infrastructure."
"Although the total losses remain below the normal threshold, the request made by Ireland falls under the criterion of 'extraordinary regional disaster', which sets out the conditions for mobilising the Solidarity Fund 'under exceptional circumstances'."
"The report approves the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund (ESF) to help Ireland tackle the disaster caused by rain and floods in 2009."
"In recent years, EU Member States have been hit by a considerable number of disasters."
"Over the first six years of the ESF, the Commission received 62 requests for financial support from 21 different countries."
"Of these, approximately one third came under the category of 'major disasters'."
"Many of these requests did not receive any support."
"Other disasters did not result in requests to deploy the fund, although they had a considerable and, in many cases, long-lasting impact on the people affected, the environment and the economy."
"The rules for mobilising this fund need to be adapted to allow more flexible and timely mobilisation, addressing a wider range of disasters with significant impacts and reducing the time that elapses between the disaster and the point at which the funds are made available."
"Yet it is also important to point out that in the first place, there must be a commitment to preventing disasters, putting into practice the recommendations recently approved by Parliament."
"I welcome the decision of the European Parliament to approve the Irish Government's application for financial help from the EU Solidarity Fund for flood relief."
"The floods in Ireland caused great damage in the country, especially in the Northwest."
"Under the EU Solidarity Fund, Ireland will receive EUR 13 million."
"This money will be used to cover some of the cost which local authorities had to pay at the time of the crisis at the end of 2009."
"The total cost of the damage done is EUR 520.9 million, and - believe it or not - that amount is below the threshold in force under the Solidarity Fund."
"The European Commission gave its approval to the EUR 13 million going to Ireland, however, because the Commission recognised that the flooding that hit Ireland at the end of 2009 was a unique regional disaster."
"in writing. - I was pleased to support this proposal and would like to express my country's appreciation for the solidarity funding allocated to our country as a result of November 2009 flooding."
"I attended a Floods Forum in Ireland last week and there were many expressions of gratitude when I mentioned it was to be voted in Parliament today."
"I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Solidarity Fund."
"I believe, in fact, that the fund is a valuable tool for enabling the European Union to show solidarity with the populations of regions affected by natural disasters, by providing financial support to help ensure a swift return to normal living conditions."
"The application approved during today's vote was made by Ireland, and it concerns the heavy rain that caused severe flooding in November 2009."
"The flooding caused severe damage to the agricultural sector, residential properties and businesses, the road network and other infrastructure."
"The Irish authorities estimate the total direct damage caused by the disaster at EUR 520.9 million."
"Although this is below the threshold provided for by the regulation, the Commission examined the application on the basis of the so-called 'extraordinary regional disaster' criterion."
"Under this criterion, a region can benefit from assistance from the fund where that region has been affected by a natural disaster, mainly a natural one, affecting the majority of its population, with serious and lasting repercussions for living conditions and the economic stability of the region."
"Lastly, I would add that the fund has been mobilised for a total amount of EUR 13 022 500."
"in writing. - I welcome this report agreeing to release EU funds to assist the victims of flooding in Ireland."
"Ireland applied for assistance from the European Solidarity Fund following heavy rain which led to severe flooding in November 2009."
"The flooding caused damage to the agricultural sector, residential properties, businesses and road networks and infrastructures."
"After evaluation of the application, the Commission has proposed to mobilise the EU Solidarity Fund for a total amount of EUR 13 022 500."
"It is worth noting that this is the first agreed proposal to mobilise funds in 2010 and the amount proposed will leave at least 98% of the European Solidarity Fund available for allocation in the rest of 2010."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and the victims of the relocations that occur in a globalised world."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers' rights."
"The EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of the relocation of businesses, and it is crucial in facilitating their access to new employment in the future."
"The EGF has been used by other EU countries in the past, and it is now right to give this assistance to Ireland, which has submitted a request for assistance from the fund following heavy rains that caused flooding in November 2009. The flooding caused severe damage to the agricultural sector, homes and businesses, the road network and other infrastructure."
"In recent years, we have seen an increasing number of environmental disasters."
"In particular, heavy rainfall has frequently caused floods which have devastating consequences for the environment and result in damage that costs huge amounts of money to rectify."
"The European Union Solidarity Fund is being mobilised to repair the damage caused by the floods in Ireland in 2009 (to the agricultural sector, housing, businesses, the road network and other infrastructure)."
"The overall cost of the damage which is a direct result of the disaster is estimated to be around EUR 520 million."
"The contribution of EUR 13 million from the EU budget will help with the reconstruction work."
"I have voted in favour of providing this support."
"The Commission did well to mobilise EUR 13 022 500 of the Solidarity Fund with the parallel submission of a draft amending budget (DAB No 8/2010) following the application for assistance submitted by Ireland in connection with the flood of November 2009, which caused massive damage to the national infrastructure amounting to some EUR 520.9 million."
"National disasters and calamities must be a priority and I hope that in the future, the European Commission will take prompter, more immediate action."
"The Irish floods took place in November 2009 and Parliament did not give its approval until today, more than one year after the event."
"The Veneto region has recently experienced a flood and I very much hope that the Commission's action will be speedier and more timely than in the past."
"I voted in favour of Mr BÃ¶ge's report because I believe that the European Union has a duty to provide help and support to regions affected by natural disasters and catastrophes."
"I believe that the concept of solidarity is connected to the idea and values underpinning the European Union."
"It is one of the core values that brought the Union into being and ensured that it prospered and enlarged over time."
"This is the reason why this allocation is not only justified and well founded but practically a duty."
"I therefore hope that such assistance will also be provided to the Italian regions severely affected by the recent floods, which brought local economies to their knees."
"I agree with Mr BÃ¶ge, whom I congratulate, on the need to mobilise the European Solidarity Fund in favour of Ireland on the basis of point 26 of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 March 2006."
"The latter allows the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund within the annual ceiling of EUR 1 billion."
"This is the first proposal to mobilise the fund in 2010."
"I support and emphasise the rapporteur's recommendations to the Commission and, given the difficult economic situation in Europe and, in particular, in Ireland, I agree that we must show solidarity."
"Lastly, I should like to stress here that, given that there has also been a disaster in northern Italy, we must take immediate action to help those stricken regions, too."
"in writing. - We have supported this resolution based on the fact that the Commission proposes to mobilise the European Solidarity Fund in favour of Ireland on the basis of point 26 of the interinstitutional agreement (IIA) of 17 May 2006."
"The IIA allows the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund within the annual ceiling of EUR 1 billion."
"This proposal is the first proposal to mobilise the Solidarity Fund in 2010."
"In parallel to this proposal, the Commission has presented a draft amending budget (DAB No 8/2010 of 24 September 2010) in order to enter in the 2010 budget the corresponding commitment and payment appropriations as foreseen in point 26 of the IIA."
"Ireland applied for assistance from the fund following heavy rain leading to severe flooding in November 2009."
"The flooding caused severe damage to the agricultural sector, residential properties and businesses, to the road network and to other infrastructure."
"The present proposal on mobilisation of the European Solidarity Fund (ESF) states the need to provide aid to Ireland due to the floods of November 2009, which caused huge losses in the agricultural and industrial sector, in infrastructure, particularly roads and water supply, and in residential areas."
"In view of this, and recalling the disaster that struck the island of Madeira in February 2010 and the effects of the Xynthia windstorm on Europe, I welcome the Commission's proposal to grant a total of EUR 13 022 500 in aid to Ireland, based on the 'extraordinary regional disaster' criterion."
"This criterion is used whenever it is shown that the damage caused has affected the majority of the region's population and that it has had serious and lasting repercussions on living conditions and economic stability in the region in question."
"However, I would like to reiterate the need to review the current ESF system in order to make it swifter and more effective in mitigating the permanent effects of natural disasters."
"in writing. - I have voted in support of the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund: Ireland - floods in November 2009."
"As was the case in my home country of Poland, ravaging floods have torn apart so many communities and families that it is vital to lend support to our friends in Ireland."
"The funds will come from the Solidarity Fund, which is allocated for major catastrophes such as this."
"The funds will go to those communities that were hit the hardest and lend support to those families and business that were most affected by these floods and assist them with rebuilding and recovering some of the revenue lost because of the devastation of their businesses."
"It is important that the EU continues to support its Member States in their time of need and truly invokes the idea of solidarity."
"As a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I simply had to vote in favour of the six resolutions tabled by Mrs Matera in order to help Dutch workers made redundant as a direct result of the global economic crisis."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is an effective tool that is focused on the long-term reintegration of workers suffering from the harmful effects of globalisation."
"I therefore believe that the use of this tool, in specific cases, is entirely justified."
"During the discussions on the budget, some people wanted the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to be immediately scrapped: we can see in this instance that it is still very useful in certain cases, since the consequences of the global crisis are still being felt today."
"Here is the explanation of my vote."
"Given that the Netherlands has requested assistance in respect of 821 redundancies in 70 companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the two contiguous NUTS II regions of Nord Brabant and Zuid Holland, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal and with the amendments to it tabled by Parliament."
"I also agree with the request to the institutions involved in the process to make the necessary efforts to accelerate the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund (ESF)."
"Aid to workers made redundant due to restructuring and relocation must be dynamic and flexible so that it can be implemented rapidly and effectively."
"In the light of the structural changes in international trade, it is vital that the European economy is able to effectively implement the instruments to support workers affected in this way, and to retrain them with a view to assisting their swift reintegration into the labour market."
"Financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis."
"It is also important to emphasise that this assistance is not a substitute for the responsibilities that normally belong to the companies, nor is it intended for the funding and restructuring of companies."
"I am voting in favour of this report, given the request by the Netherlands for assistance in respect of 821 redundancies in 70 enterprises operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the regions of Nord Brabant and Zuid Holland."
"821 redundancies in 70 companies in the graphics sector in the Nord Brabant and Zuid Holland regions of the Netherlands show that the global economic and financial crisis does not spare sectors which, at first glance, appear to be more sheltered from its effects."
"This hints at the worrying reduction in the number of printing and publishing companies in the Netherlands and, consequently, the very downturn in the economy as a whole."
"The European Commission deemed this request for printing and recorded media reproduction companies justifiable, and was backed overwhelmingly by the relevant parliamentary committee."
"I therefore believe that all the conditions are present to enable me to support the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in this case."
"I hope that this temporary support will help redundant workers to integrate more successfully into the labour market."
"Given the social impact of the global economic crisis, which has had a particular effect on employment, the proper use of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is of pivotal importance in alleviating the plight of many European individuals and families, contributing to their social reintegration and professional development, while, at the same time, developing a new, qualified workforce to meet the needs of companies and boost the economy."
"This plan for intervention in the Netherlands to help 821 people made redundant from 70 companies operating in the regions of Nord Brabant and Zuid Holland falls within the same framework."
"I therefore hope that the European institutions will redouble their effects in implementing measures that speed up and improve the rates of utilisation of such an important resource as the EGF, which currently has very low levels of mobilisation."
"This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested."
"Six more applications have been made to mobilise the Solidarity Fund, corresponding to the closure of hundreds more companies in Europe."
"Altogether, more than 3 000 workers have been made redundant."
"Initial estimates as to the number of people who would benefit from the fund at the time of its creation have long been exceeded."
"Above and beyond the systematic mobilisation of this instrument, what is needed is a clear break with the neoliberal policies that are causing an economic and social disaster within the countries of the European Union before our very eyes."
"Palliatives are indeed needed for the disaster, but the causes need to be addressed first of all."
"Every new application to mobilise this fund increases the urgency of the measures that we have been advocating, which are aimed at fighting unemployment effectively, boosting economic activity, eradicating jobs with no security, and reducing working hours without cutting pay."
"These are measures that also combat the relocation of companies."
"Finally, as on other occasions, we cannot omit to point out the injustice of a regulation that offers greater benefit to countries with higher incomes, particularly those with higher levels of salaries and unemployment support."
"I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of the Netherlands because I consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers in difficulties on account of the economic crisis."
"The EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or, following the 2009 amendment, on account of the economic crisis, in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"Today's vote concerned a request for assistance for 821 workers made redundant by 70 companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the two contiguous NUTS II regions of Nord Brabant and Zuid Holland, amounting to a sum of EUR 2 890 027 financed by the EGF."
"To conclude, I welcome the adoption of the report, which shows that the EGF is a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis."
"in writing. - I welcome this report, which backs a Commission proposal to mobilise EUR 2 890 027 from the European Globalisation Fund in order to support the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant as a result of the economic crisis."
"This application concerns 821 redundancies in 70 enterprises (printing and reproduction of recorded media) over a nine month period."
"The European Globalisation Fund was created to help mitigate such unfortunate events."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and the victims of the relocations that occur in a globalised world."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers' rights."
"The EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of the relocation of businesses, and it is crucial in facilitating their access to new employment in the future."
"The EGF has been used in the past by other EU countries, so it is now appropriate to provide aid to the Netherlands, which has submitted a request for assistance in respect of 821 redundancies in 70 companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the two contiguous NUTS II regions of Nord Brabant and Zuid Holland."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was set up with the purpose of supporting the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant due to the current process of world market globalisation."
"EGF aid applications are evaluated by the Commission, which, in this case, was in favour of the eligibility application."
"Now, the approval of the budget authority is required."
"The application examined by the report, which is the nineteenth during the 2010 budget, refers to EGF mobilisation for a sum of EUR 453 632 (we note that the annual fund must not exceed EUR 500 million) requested by the Netherlands for 140 redundancies in the press sector in the Drenthe region."
"The economic crisis is putting many companies in difficulty and more and more employees are losing their jobs."
"We must protect these workers."
"My vote could not be anything else but in favour."
"Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund would benefit 70 different enterprises and save 821 jobs."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this report."
"Once again, we find ourselves in this Chamber to approve an exceptional allocation within our own borders."
"Only, in today's sitting, we are approving six allocations."
"I say this with regret, since this type of measure is associated with crisis situations and with a series of problems that have repercussions for the economy, the labour market, workers and their families."
"Fortunately, however, we have this resource available to us."
"It is precisely in these kinds of situations that the European Union demonstrates its values and the qualities that set it apart."
"European solidarity and the defence of European needs are values that must be safeguarded and protected."
"This is the message that Parliament and the European Union wish to convey, and I hope that there will be greater sensitivity in the transmission of that message, not least to combat lazy anti-European demagogy and to show, instead, just how essential support and assistance at European level really are."
"The request submitted by the Netherlands for assistance under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in relation to 821 redundancies from 70 companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the two contiguous NUTS II regions of Nord Brabant and Zuid Holland fulfils all the legally established eligibility criteria."
"In effect, under Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the scope of the EGF was temporarily widened to include its intervention in situations like this, in which, as a direct result of the global economic and financial crisis, there are 'at least 500 redundancies over a period of nine months, particularly in small or medium-sized enterprises, in a NACE 2 division in one region or two contiguous regions at NUTS II level'."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, and I hope that the mobilisation of the EGF will contribute to the successful integration of these workers into the labour market."
"I voted for the European Parliament resolution on the mobilisation of the EGF for granting aid to the redundant workers."
"In December 2009, the Netherlands submitted a request for assistance to use the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in connection with the redundancies which were made in eight regions, in enterprises operating in the graphics sector."
"The application concerns 821 redundancies made in 70 enterprises involved in printing and the reproduction of recorded media."
"The redundancies were made in the period between 1 April and 29 December 2009 in the two contiguous regions of Nord Brabant and Zuid Holland."
"The economic and financial crisis has also caused a drop in demand in the printing and publishing sector of about 32% for printed advertising material and of between 7.5% and 18.2% for magazines and newspapers."
"The printing and publishing industry in the Netherlands went through a major restructuring process in order to be able to continue to compete with similar sectors in Turkey, China and India."
"I believe that the procedure for allocating these funds must be simplified to facilitate the affected enterprises' access to the EGF."
"Here is the explanation of my vote."
"Given that the Netherlands has requested assistance in respect of 140 redundancies in two companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the NUTS II region of Drenthe, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal and with the amendments to it tabled by Parliament."
"I also agree that EGF aid is not a replacement for actions that are the responsibility of firms under national legislation or collective agreements, nor does it finance the restructuring of firms or sectors."
"Despite lending my support to all the requests to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund presented by the Netherlands concerning the severe wave of redundancies which has plagued two areas of the graphics sector - printing and reproduction of recorded media and publishing - I believe that the Dutch authorities could provide more details about the scope of the measures and their accuracy, so as to allow these measures to be assessed more effectively."
"I hope that the sector can recover and that the redundant workers, particularly the older ones, are able to rebuild their lives and resume their place in the labour market."
"Given the social impact of the global economic crisis, which has had a particular effect on employment, the proper use of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is of pivotal importance in alleviating the plight of many European individuals and families, contributing to their social reintegration and professional development, while, at the same time, developing a new, qualified workforce to meet the needs of companies and boost the economy."
"This plan for intervention in the Netherlands to help 140 people made redundant from two companies in Drenthe falls within the same framework."
"I therefore hope that the European institutions will redouble their effects in implementing measures that speed up and improve the rates of utilisation of such an important resource as the EGF, which currently has very low levels of mobilisation."
"This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested."
"I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of the Netherlands because I consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers in difficulties on account of the economic crisis."
"The EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or, following the 2009 amendment, on account of the economic crisis, in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"Today's vote concerned a request for assistance for 140 workers made redundant by two companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the NUTS II region of Drenthe, amounting to a sum of EUR 453 632 financed by the EGF."
"To conclude, I welcome the adoption of the report, which shows that the EGF is a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which backs an application to mobilise the European Globalisation Fund concerning 140 redundancies in 2 enterprises (printing and reproduction of recorded media) over a nine month period in the Drenthe Division in the Netherlands."
"It forms part of a package of six interrelated applications dealing with redundancies in eight different regions of the Netherlands."
"There has been a substantial decrease in demand in the printing and publishing sector due to the economic crisis."
"I welcome the solidarity we are showing with the workers facing a difficult time."
"I voted for Barbara Matera's draft reports on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for the benefit of the Netherlands, as I think that the European Union must offer support to redundant workers, providing them with dynamic, efficient financial assistance."
"Against the backdrop of the current economic and social crisis, our actions must be targeted at granting aid to those who need it."
"We are all aware that the priority must be to protect EU citizens from the effects of globalisation and economic recession."
"I think that the Union can make a significant contribution to combating the impact of the economic crisis and reducing unemployment among its citizens."
"On this occasion, I would like to draw attention to the fact that EU Member States can and must ask for the aid granted by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"In this context, I want to point out that my country, Romania, exemplifies the spirit of solidarity in the European Union in crisis situations, whether we are talking about Greece, the Netherlands etc., as confirmation of the fact that we are, together, one big family: the Family of a United Europe."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and the victims of the relocations that occur in a globalised world."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers' rights."
"The EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of the relocation of businesses, and it is crucial in facilitating their access to new employment in the future."
"The EGF has been used in the past by other EU countries, so it is now appropriate to provide this aid to the Netherlands, which has submitted a request for assistance in respect of 140 redundancies in two companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the NUTS II region of Drenthe."
"in writing. - (DE) Growing numbers of people are being made unemployed as a result of globalisation measures."
"In the nine-month reference period from 1 April 2009 to 29 December 2009, there were 140 redundancies in two companies in the Dutch region of Drenthe."
"Now, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is being mobilised to provide a contribution of EUR 453 632."
"I have voted in favour of the report, because it allows the EGF to fulfil its obligations."
"Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund would benefit two different enterprises and save 140 jobs."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this report."
"This application is based on Article 2(c) of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) Regulation, and is part of a larger package of six interrelated applications, all of which concern redundancies in eight different NUTS II regions in the Netherlands from companies operating in the graphics sector, which has been hard hit by the global economic and financial crisis."
"More specifically, this concerns 140 redundancies from two companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the NUTS II region of Drenthe, a province which is facing a very difficult situation, both because it has the third highest unemployment rate in the Netherlands (7.5%) and because it has a per capita income that is significantly below the national average."
"I therefore believe that in this case, all the conditions are met for the mobilisation of the EGF, and I hope that the assistance will be made available to the redundant workers swiftly and efficiently."
"Here is the explanation of my vote."
"Given that the Netherlands has requested assistance in respect of 129 redundancies in nine companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the NUTS II region of Limburg, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal and with the amendments to it tabled by Parliament."
"I also agree with the Commission's proposal of an alternative to unused European Social Fund resources as a source of payment appropriations for mobilising the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), following Parliament's frequent reminders that the EGF was created separately as a specific instrument, with its own objectives and deadlines, and that it is therefore necessary to identify appropriate budget headings for transfers."
"The field of printing and reproduction of recorded media, which forms part of the graphics sector, has been particularly eroded in the Netherlands, as shown by the various applications to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF)."
"The region of Drenthe, which has the third highest unemployment rate in the country, has not remained immune to this trend."
"It is worth emphasising the need for this fund to be mobilised quickly and effectively, without excessive red tape, so as to contribute to better training for the workers made redundant, and thus facilitating their reintegration into the labour market in better conditions than those in which they left."
"Given the social impact of the global economic crisis, which has had a particular effect on employment, the proper use of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is of pivotal importance in alleviating the plight of many European individuals and families, contributing to their social reintegration and professional development, while, at the same time, developing a new, qualified workforce to meet the needs of companies and boost the economy."
"This plan for intervention in the Netherlands to help 129 people made redundant from 9 companies operating in the region of Limburg falls within the same framework."
"I therefore hope that the European institutions will redouble their effects in implementing measures that speed up and improve the rates of utilisation of such an important resource as the EGF, which currently has very low levels of mobilisation."
"This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested."
"I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of the Netherlands because I consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers in difficulties on account of the economic crisis."
"The EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or, following the 2009 amendment, on account of the economic crisis, in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"Today's vote concerned a request for assistance for 129 workers made redundant by nine companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the NUTS II region of Limburg, amounting to a sum of EUR 549 946 financed by the EGF."
"To conclude, I welcome the adoption of the report, which shows that the EGF is a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis."
"in writing. - I support this measure of European solidarity with the 129 workers in 9 enterprises (printing and reproduction) who are facing redundancy."
"The EUR 549 946 will offer some assistance to them in being reintegrated into the labour market."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and the victims of the relocations that occur in a globalised world."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers' rights."
"The EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of the relocation of businesses, and it is crucial in facilitating their access to new employment in the future."
"The EGF has been used in the past by other EU countries, so it is now appropriate to provide aid to the Netherlands, which has submitted a request for assistance in respect of 129 redundancies in nine companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the NUTS II region of Limburg."
"The far-reaching effects of globalisation are resulting in more and more people losing their jobs."
"Redundancies are becoming increasingly common."
"Between 1 April 2009 and 29 December 2009, 129 workers were made redundant by a machinery and equipment manufacturer in Limburg in the Netherlands."
"Now an application has been made to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for a contribution of EUR 549 946 to help those affected."
"I have voted in favour of the report which will prevent those people who have been made redundant from suffering further financial problems."
"Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund can save 129 jobs in nine different enterprises."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this report."
"This application is based on Article 2(c) of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) Regulation, and is part of a larger package of six interrelated applications, all of which concern redundancies in eight different NUTS II regions in the Netherlands from companies operating in the graphics sector, which has been hard hit by the global economic and financial crisis."
"More specifically, this concerns 129 redundancies from nine companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the NUTS II region of Limburg, a province which is facing a very difficult situation, both because it has the second highest unemployment rate in the Netherlands (8%) and because it has a per capita income that is significantly below the national average."
"I therefore believe that in this case, all the conditions are met for the mobilisation of the EGF, and I hope that the assistance will be made available to the redundant workers swiftly and efficiently."
"Given that the Netherlands has requested assistance in respect of 650 redundancies in 45 companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the two contiguous NUTS II regions of Gelderland and Overijssel, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal and with the amendments to it tabled by Parliament."
"I also agree with Parliament's position regretting the severe shortcomings of the Commission in implementing programmes on competitiveness and innovation, particularly during this economic crisis, which is significantly increasing the need for such support."
"650 workers have lost their jobs at 45 companies within the field of printing and reproduction of recorded media in the graphics sector, in the Dutch regions of Gelderland and Overijssel, adding their difficult situation to that of other workers and companies all over the country."
"Faced with all the applications made for mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, it is important to ascertain how the workers will be guided and the extent to which new jobs and incentives for starting self-employment are sustainable, or whether they will run the same risks as those who have failed at doing so."
"Inventiveness and entrepreneurship have long been characteristic qualities of Dutch society, and they deserve to be remembered and revived in the hard times that we are experiencing."
"Given the social impact of the global economic crisis, which has had a particular effect on employment, the proper use of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is of pivotal importance in alleviating the plight of many European individuals and families, contributing to their social reintegration and professional development, while, at the same time, developing a new, qualified workforce to meet the needs of companies and boost the economy."
"This plan for intervention in the Netherlands to help 650 people made redundant from 45 companies operating in the regions of Gelderland and Overijssel falls within the same framework."
"I therefore hope that the European institutions will redouble their effects in implementing measures that speed up and improve the rates of utilisation of such an important resource as the EGF, which currently has very low levels of mobilisation."
"This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested."
"I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of the Netherlands because I consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers in difficulties on account of the economic crisis."
"The EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or, following the 2009 amendment, on account of the economic crisis, in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"Today's vote concerned a request for assistance for 650 workers made redundant by 45 companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the two NUTS II regions of Gelderland and Overijssel, amounting to a sum of EUR 2 013 619 financed by the EGF."
"To conclude, I welcome the adoption of the report, which shows that the EGF is a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis."
"in writing. - I welcome the report, which backs plans to release EUR 2 013 619 to help workers in Overijssel made redundant due to the downturn in the printing industry."
"This support from the European Globalisation Fund should help reintegrate the workers into the labour market and I am pleased to see European solidarity in operation."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and the victims of the relocations that occur in a globalised world."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers' rights."
"The EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of the relocation of businesses, and it is crucial in facilitating their access to new employment in the future."
"The EGF has been used in the past by other EU countries, so it is now appropriate to provide aid to the Netherlands, which has submitted a request for assistance in respect of cases concerning 650 redundancies in 45 companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the two contiguous NUTS II regions of Gelderland and Overijssel."
"In the nine-month reference period from 1 April 2009 to 29 December 2009, 650 workers were made redundant by 45 companies in the two Dutch regions of Gelderland and Overijssel."
"The redundancies were the consequence of the economic crisis and of structural changes in world trade patterns."
"In order to improve the future prospects of people who have lost their jobs, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was created, with annual funding of EUR 500 million, to intervene in cases such as these."
"I have voted in favour of the report, because the redundant workers deserve the support of the EGF."
"Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund can save 650 jobs in 45 different enterprises."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this report."
"The request submitted by the Netherlands for assistance under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in relation to 650 redundancies from 45 companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the two contiguous NUTS II regions of Gelderland and Overijssel fulfils all the legally established eligibility criteria."
"In effect, under Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the scope of the EGF was temporarily widened to include its intervention in situations like this, in which, as a direct result of the global economic and financial crisis, there are 'at least 500 redundancies over a period of nine months, particularly in small or medium-sized enterprises, in a NACE 2 division in one region or two contiguous regions at NUTS II level'."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, and I hope that the mobilisation of the EGF will contribute to the successful integration of these workers into the labour market."
"Given that the Netherlands has requested assistance in respect of 720 redundancies in 79 companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the two contiguous NUTS II regions of Noord Holland and Utrecht, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal and with the amendments to it tabled by Parliament."
"I also agree with the Commission's proposal of an alternative to unused European Social Fund resources as a source of payment appropriations for mobilising the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), following Parliament's frequent reminders that the EGF was created separately as a specific instrument, with its own objectives and deadlines, and that it is therefore necessary to identify appropriate budget headings for transfers."
"The crisis in the graphics sector in the Netherlands has affected a number of the country's regions, including Noord Holland and Utrecht."
"In this case, there were 720 redundancies in 79 enterprises."
"This is one of six applications that have been submitted by the Netherlands and have merited the support of the European Commission and the Committee on Budgets."
"I, too, support it, and hope that the sector is able to reorganise itself and that the redundant workers can find new jobs, whether in the same area of printing and reproduction of recorded media, or in others to which they are or could become suited."
"The awarded support could be a step towards this."
"Given the social impact of the global economic crisis, which has had a particular effect on employment, the proper use of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is of pivotal importance in alleviating the plight of many European individuals and families, contributing to their social reintegration and professional development, while, at the same time, developing a new, qualified workforce to meet the needs of companies and boost the economy."
"This plan for intervention in the Netherlands to help 720 people made redundant from 79 companies operating in the regions of Noord Holland and Utrecht falls within the same framework."
"I therefore hope that the European institutions will redouble their effects in implementing measures that speed up and improve the rates of utilisation of such an important resource as the EGF, which currently has very low levels of mobilisation."
"This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested."
"This is one of the reports on the six applications by the Netherlands for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in order to support the reintegration in the labour market of workers made redundant as a result of the economic and financial crisis."
"There are some specific aspects of these six applications that is important to point out, in addition to the delay in the process of approval by the European Commission, which, however, is now the norm unfortunately."
"These specific aspects refer to the content of these six applications, all of which concern redundancies in eight different regions of the Netherlands, in small companies of the graphics sector, specifically, printing and reproduction of recorded media and publishing activities."
"This time, a total of EUR 2 266 625 of the EGF has been mobilised for the benefit of the Netherlands."
"We have here a case of coincidental timing: Parliament has been asked to give its opinion today on six requests for European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) assistance that have been submitted by the Netherlands while, at the same time, the 2011 budget negotiations are stalling because of the refusal by the Netherlands and by two other Member States to engage in a responsible and constructive dialogue on the future of the European budget."
"Today's votes are therefore, in my view, an opportunity to point out that the European budget is not just an accounting tool that everyone finds daunting: it is, first and foremost, the 'power' behind the European Union that enables it to work day in day out to protect its citizens, and particularly through the EGF, to protect unemployed workers."
"The vote on the allocation of EGF aid to the Dutch workers could have been used as a 'protest vote' against the Dutch Government, which is criticising on the one hand what it is benefiting from on the other."
"Instead, it has been an opportunity for Parliament to recall that the principle of solidarity must be the foundation on which all EU decisions are made."
"I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of the Netherlands because I consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers in difficulties on account of the economic crisis."
"The EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or, following the 2009 amendment, on account of the economic crisis, in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"Today's vote concerned a request for assistance for 720 workers made redundant by 79 companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the two NUTS II regions of Noord Holland and Utrecht, amounting to a sum of EUR 2 266 625 financed by the EGF."
"To conclude, I welcome the adoption of the report, which shows that the EGF is a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis."
"in writing. - I am pleased that EUR 2 266 625 has been made available through the European Globalisation Fund in order to support the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant in the printing industry due to the global economic crisis."
"This application concerns 720 redundancies in 79 enterprises in the Noord Holland and Utrecht Division of the Netherlands."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and the victims of the relocations that occur in a globalised world."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers' rights."

"Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund would benefit 79 different enterprises and save 720 jobs."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this report."
"The request submitted by the Netherlands for assistance under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in relation to 720 redundancies from 79 companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the two contiguous NUTS II regions of Noord Holland and Utrecht fulfils all the legally established eligibility criteria."
"In effect, under Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the scope of the EGF was temporarily widened to include its intervention in situations like this, in which, as a direct result of the global economic and financial crisis, there are 'at least 500 redundancies over a period of nine months, particularly in small or medium-sized enterprises, in a NACE 2 division in one region or two contiguous regions at NUTS II level'."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, and I hope that the mobilisation of the EGF will contribute to the successful integration of these workers into the labour market."
"Given that the Netherlands has requested assistance in respect of 598 redundancies in eight companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 58 (publishing activities) in the two contiguous NUTS II regions of Noord Holland and Zuid Holland, I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal and with the amendments to it tabled by Parliament."
"I also agree with the request to the institutions involved in the process to make the necessary efforts to accelerate the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund (ESF)."
"Anyone who monitors the numbers and geographical distribution of redundancies in the graphics sector in the Netherlands, which are the reason for the various applications to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), will surely be alarmed to see how numerous and widespread they are."
"In the contiguous regions of Noord Holland and Zuid Holland alone, 598 workers lost their jobs in publishing over a period of just nine months."
"Competition with third countries, along with the financial and economic crisis ravaging the whole of Europe, is a crucial factor in what has been happening, making it clear that solutions need to be sought to people's immediate problems: their reintegration into the labour market, and their medium- and long-term subsistence."
"The EGF has a palliative role and can serve as a stimulus, but it is manifestly insufficient to solve the serious problems affecting so many families on its own."
"Given the social impact of the global economic crisis, which has had a particular effect on employment, the proper application of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is of pivotal importance in alleviating the plight of many European individuals and families, contributing to their social reintegration and professional development, while, at the same time, developing a new, qualified workforce to meet the needs of companies and boost the economy."
"This plan for intervention in the Netherlands to help 598 people made redundant from 8 companies operating in the regions of Noord Holland and Zuid Holland falls within the same framework."
"I therefore hope that the European institutions will redouble their effects in implementing measures that speed up and improve the rates of utilisation of such an important resource as the EGF, which currently has very low levels of mobilisation."

"The EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or, following the 2009 amendment, on account of the economic crisis, in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"Today's vote concerned a request for assistance for 598 workers made redundant by eight companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 58 (publishing activities) in the two NUTS II regions of Noord Holland and Zuid Holland, amounting to a sum of EUR 2 326 459 financed by the EGF."
"Lastly, I must emphasise that today's adoption of the six reports shows that the EGF is a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis."
"in writing. - I welcome this report and the support the European Globalisation Fund is giving to workers made redundant."
"This proposal is for EUR 2 326 459 to assist 598 workers, from 8 enterprises in the printing and reproduction media, who are losing their jobs because of the economic crisis."
"This is an important example of European solidarity."
"The EU is an area of solidarity, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of that."
"This support is essential for helping the unemployed and the victims of the relocations that occur in a globalised world."
"An increasing number of companies are relocating, taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers' rights."
"The EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of the relocation of businesses, and it is crucial in facilitating their access to new employment in the future."

"During the nine-month reference period from 1 April 2009 to 29 December 2009, there were 598 redundancies in a total of eight companies in Noord Holland and Zuid Holland."
"Each one of these workers was a victim of globalisation."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established to cushion the impact of social injustices of this kind."
"I have voted in favour of the report, because all the requirements for the mobilisation of the EGF have been met."
"Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund would benefit eight different enterprises and save 598 jobs."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this report."
"The request submitted by the Netherlands for assistance under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in relation to 598 redundancies from eight companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 58 (publishing activities) in the two contiguous NUTS II regions of Noord Holland and Zuid Holland fulfils all the legally established eligibility criteria."

"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, and I hope that the mobilisation of the EGF will contribute to the successful integration of these workers into the labour market."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) receives annual funding of EUR 500 million with the aim of providing financial support to workers affected by major structural changes in world trade patterns."
"Estimates indicate that between 35 000 and 50 000 employees could benefit from this support each year."
"The money can be used to pay for help in finding new jobs, tailor-made training, assistance in becoming self-employed or starting up a company, mobility and support for disadvantaged or older workers."
"I have voted in favour of the report, because the mobilisation of the funding is fully justified."
"Regarding the request submitted by the Netherlands for assistance in relation to 140 redundancies from two companies in NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the region of Drenthe, I refer to all the arguments set out in my declaration of vote regarding report to justify my vote in favour of this report."
"I abstained on all of Mrs Matera's reports on mobilising the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to help various Dutch regions, not because I oppose these plans, but to issue a warning to the Dutch Government, which has a populist and anti-European policy."
"The Netherlands is opposed to increasing the European budget but has no qualms about accepting European aid."
"What is more, the Netherlands is the main beneficiary, after Germany, of the internal market."
"It is time Dutch politics returned to their roots."
"The Netherlands is, after all, one of the founder members of the EU."
"Recalls the institutions' commitment to ensuring a smooth and rapid procedure for the adoption of the decisions on the mobilisation of the EGF, providing one-off, time-limited individual support geared to helping workers who have suffered redundancies as a result of globalisation and the financial and economic crisis; emphasises the role that the EGF can play in the reintegration of workers made redundant into the labour market; 3. Stresses that, in accordance with Article 6 of the EGF Regulation, it should be ensured that the EGF supports the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment; reiterates that assistance from the EGF must not replace actions which are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor measures restructuring companies or sectors."
"The package of six applications from the Netherlands to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) received the support of Parliament."
"Of course, I also voted in favour of the Dutch applications, because it is important for us to provide rapid support for citizens of a Member State who have lost their jobs and this is why the EGF was created."
"However, I gave my support to the six applications rather grudgingly, in the light of the highly obstructive attitude of the Dutch Government during the budget negotiations on Monday of last week in Brussels."
"In my opinion, flatly refusing to allow Parliament to hold a serious discussion on its involvement in the future financial framework and, at the same time, calling for Parliament to vote in favour of financial support for the Netherlands, are two completely incompatible things."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission reports have not established a single breach of competition by the German Alcohol Monopoly on the internal market."
"That is why I am in favour of this proposal."
"The report also stresses the importance of these provisions for the rural economy in Germany, particularly with regard to small distilleries."
"Given the importance for all small-scale distilleries of their participation in the German Alcohol Monopoly and the need for further transition towards the market, as well as the fact that the reports presented do not demonstrate an infringement of the competition rules in the single market, I think that the monopoly extension period should have ended by 2013 at the latest, the date when the new CAP comes into force."
"I voted for this report because I believe more time needs to be allocated for the adaptation of Germany's small-scale distilleries so that they can survive on the free market."
"I agree with the European Commission's proposal for an extension of a few more years to complete the process of abolishing the monopoly as well as the aid, and allow for its definitive phasing out in 2017."
"Like the rapporteur, I find it regrettable that the common agricultural policy after 2013 will have to inherit old situations, such as this special arrangement within the Single Common Market Organisation Regulation as regards the aid granted in the framework of the German alcohol monopoly."
"Nevertheless, I understand the need to extend the period for phasing the monopoly out, given the economic needs of the German rural economy, particularly in some of the country's federal states."
"In fact, while European rules should be predictable and impartial, they should also introduce the flexibility necessary to meet the specific needs of the markets and the European public, in this case, distillery owners in Germany."
"We voted for this report, despite disagreeing with the arguments tabled by the Commission and the rapporteur to justify extending the aid."
"Both of them think that the few intervention measures that still remain should be completely phased out, subjecting agriculture to the 'free market'."
"Therefore, they limit themselves to stating that 'more time is needed to facilitate the adaptation process, and to allow distillers to survive on the free market'."
"In contrast to the rapporteur's position, we believe that intervention in the markets and regulation instruments should, in fact, be the rule rather than the exception."
"That is the only way to guarantee a living income for farmers, especially small and medium-sized producers."
"Therefore, it is the only way to guarantee the future of small and medium-sized agriculture, as well as the right to produce, and each country's right to food security and food sovereignty."
"Instead of an exception being made for Germany for a specific product, other countries and other products should be considered for intervention as well."
"Firstly, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the chair of the committee, Mr De Castro, and to the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), Mrs Jeggle, for their hard work."
"The final extension of the German alcohol monopoly which was adopted today represents an important step forward."
"It gives our fruit distilleries, in particular, the security to plan for the future beyond 2010."
"This is important because it enables them to prepare for the transition to the free market and to maintain one of Germany's unique cultural landscapes."
"However, it is now essential to make intensive use of this period of time to put in place the necessary adaptation measures, because there will be no further extensions of the monopoly."
"That is the message of today's report."
"I would like to express my support for this report, principally because the German government aid to the alcohol monopoly goes mainly to farmers and small distilleries."
"This aid does not evidence any breaches of the principles of competition, and it is a form of support for the smallest businesses."
"Despite the fact that the aid is being given in an appropriate way, I support the proposal for information to be made available about all events related to this support."
"There must not be breaches of any kind, because this would be unfair to other often much weaker and poorer producers."
"I do, however, have certain doubts as to whether one Member State supporting its economy in this way will not reduce stability in the European market."
"This type of instrument should be extended to other Member States, so that they, too, will be able to support their economies."
"The German Alcohol Monopoly as a concept is to be phased out."
"The farmers affected have prepared for the opening up of the market."
"Thus, the aid is no longer fully utilised and measures have been taken, such as the establishment of cooperatives and changes in direct marketing methods, in preparation for this opening up of the market."
"However, a sufficient amount of time is required for these measures to be taken."
"At the end of the day, it is not large enterprises that are affected by this arrangement, but many small farmers in rural areas."
"For this reason, I support an extension of the arrangement."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"Currently, as an exception to State aid rules, the German authorities may grant State aid under the German Alcohol Monopoly for products marketed as alcohol of agricultural origin."
"The current derogation ends on 31 December 2010 and the draft regulation extends the application of the derogation and proposes that the production/sales monopoly shall gradually decrease so that the monopoly will finally cease to exist as from 1 January 2018."
"I welcome this phasing out."
"The constant pursuit of a functioning single market is incompatible with the presence of monopolies in any sector."
"In the particular case of the German Alcohol Monopoly, there are certain attenuating circumstances that allow it still to exist."
"However, in line with the recommendations of this report, we have to move towards the total abolition of agricultural bonded distilleries from 2013 and small-scale flat-rate distilleries from 2017."
"Whether and in what form the German Alcohol Monopoly will be retained and what changes will be made to it are all factors that will have an impact primarily on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"The EU constantly claims that it wants to provide more support for SMEs, which are the motor of the economy and the main providers of jobs."
"In this context, we need legal certainty and, therefore, an extension of the monopoly over a longer period."
"This is the only way in which small and medium-sized businesses can afford to make the necessary purchases to prepare for the forthcoming deregulation, for example, by establishing cooperatives, modernising their equipment or extending their direct marketing activities."
"Of course, the issue of the monopoly could have been combined with the phasing out of the common agricultural policy and the new regulations which will apply from 2013."
"However, there were no pressing grounds for doing so."
"The important thing is to ensure that the adaptation process is designed to allow the distilleries to survive after the monopoly has come to an end."
"I agree with the rapporteur on this issue."
"However, I am not in favour of the internal procedure, which does not adequately meet the requirements for transparency and democracy."
"For this reason, I have abstained from voting."
"I am in favour of the proposal, but I believe that a whole range of factors need to be taken in account."
"Firstly, I believe that an impact assessment should have been carried out on a regular basis and that the period of extension of the monopoly should not have surpassed 2013, the date of the entry into force of the new common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"However, given the importance for the small-scale distilleries of their participation in the monopoly and the need for further transition towards the market, and given the fact that reports presented do not demonstrate an infringement of competition in the single market, I support the extension."
"I hope, however, that such details will be taken into account as part of the reform of the new CAP and that a balanced solution will be found to open up the market while, at the same time, protecting traditional local activities."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe the needs of the German rural economy justify extending the initial period of validity of the exception provided for in Article 182(4) of the Single Common Market Organisation (CMO) Regulation, so as to provide the best possible conditions for small distilleries to prepare appropriately for their entry into the free market."
"in writing. - Our group has supported this text and the line taken by the rapporteur in the sense that it is in favour of the proposal presented, while considering that several points need to be taken into account for the implementation of the regulation."
"The rapporteur thinks a regular impact assessment should have been carried out and that the period of extension of the monopoly should not have surpassed 2013, the date of the entry into force of the new CAP."
"However, given the importance for the small-scale distilleries of their participation in the monopoly and the need for further transition towards the market, and given the fact that reports presented do not demonstrate an infringement of competition in the single market, the rapporteur is ready to support the proposal."
"I voted in favour of this report which authorises the addition of a further 718 pharmaceutical and chemical products to the existing list of 8 619 products benefiting from duty-free treatment upon importation into the EU, which is due to be implemented on 1 January 2011, as I believe that it is vital that duty-free treatment begins straight away next year, given that the US will make the implementation of the update conditional upon its entry into force on 1 January."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report, which shows how crucial the fourth review (Pharma IV), launched in 2009, is for keeping pace with the rapidly changing product environment in the pharmaceutical industry."
"Given that the lists are produced by the industry and decided on by consensus by the participants, I welcome the agreement that has been reached by all the Member States who have supported previous reviews and also supported the product coverage of this fourth review."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Moreira, for having highlighted the need to carry out periodic reviews of the list of pharmaceutical and chemical products that enter the European Union duty-free."
"I support this measure - in fact, I voted in favour of it - because the manufacturing scenario in which the pharmaceutical industry operates unfolds at a frantic pace and it is therefore essential to update the list, which currently includes more than 8 000 products, on a constant basis."
"All the Member States, which were already in favour of the previous adjustments, have given their consent to the proposal to extend this list by including 718 new products."
"Lastly, I support the mechanism implemented, which protects the interests and health of European consumers."
"I am in favour, on condition that the appropriate scientific tests are carried out and the list of drugs, intermediates and active ingredients covered by the agreement on duty-free treatment is extended."
"The proposal sends out a strong signal to the markets."
"In fact, it serves primarily to confirm the commitment of certain important members of the World Trade Organisation to the free market."
"It also has the effect of extending the boundaries of the potential market for the results of certain scientific research sectors, thereby encouraging investment in those sectors and, with it, the fight against diseases for which there is still no effective cure."
"Lastly, the proposal sets an example to those countries for which pharmaceuticals represent a necessary item of expenditure if they are to guarantee a future for the younger generations, and a call to take a stance in favour of the adoption of development and wealth creation policies."
"I voted for this report because I advocate the addition of a further 718 pharmaceutical and chemical products to the list of products benefiting from bound duty-free treatment upon importation into the EU."
"The review of this list of products is necessary to cater for the rapidly changing product environment in the pharmaceutical industry."
"Given the importance of the pharmaceuticals trade, not just to public health but also to the economy, I welcome the decision to include 718 new substances on the list of products eligible for duty-free treatment."
"The arrangement is unanimously supported by the pharmaceutical industry because it eliminates tariffs on inputs and intermediaries that have to be paid even in connection with intra-company trade, thereby facilitating international trade in these products and benefiting pharmaceutical companies."
"This arrangement could, in the final analysis, be reflected in the retail price of medicines sold to the public."
"This proposal invited the Council and Parliament to authorise the addition of a further 718 pharmaceutical and chemical products to the existing list of 8 619 products benefiting from bound duty-free treatment upon importation into the EU."
"This issue is not controversial, as there is consensus among the stakeholders, and it has the support of the Member States."
"Lists are put together by the industry and decided on by consensus by the participants."
"This addition of products is necessary to respond to the rapidly changing product environment in the pharmaceutical industry."
"The intended date of implementation is 1 January 2011."
"The US has made the implementation of the update conditional upon implementation on 1 January."
"Other participants are expected to follow this example, except Japan, which has announced an expected delay of 6 months in implementation."
"in writing. - The WTO duty-free rules for pharmaceutical ingredients are universally supported by the pharmaceutical industry."
"This is an industry which is important to Scotland, employing some 5 000 people nationwide."
"The EU as a whole is a key producer and user of pharmaceutical products and I was happy to support this report."
"in writing. - This proposal invites Council and Parliament to authorise the addition of a further 718 pharmaceutical and chemical products to the already existing list of 8 619 products benefiting from bound duty-free treatment upon importation into the EU."
"I voted for it."
"The trade in pharmaceutical products is an important part of world trade."
"The inclusion of a further 718 products on the list for bound duty-free treatment is a beneficial measure, at both an economic and a public health level."
"The decision to add these products to the 8 619 already on the list may also have an impact on the final price of medicines, which is beneficial for everyone."
"As part of a World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement, the EU, the USA, Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Norway and Macao in China have decided to reduce the duties on certain pharmaceutical products and active ingredients to zero."
"Of course, the list of products is constantly being amended and extended to keep pace with the results of research and the latest developments in the pharmaceutical world."
"The list of products that benefit from duty-free treatment, which originally contained 6 000 items, and which was created by the industry and reviewed by the states in question, will now be expanded to include more than 8 600 pharmaceutical and chemical products."
"It is important to justify the duty-free treatment of pharmaceutical and chemical substances and active ingredients."
"However, the entire system seems to be highly complicated and will result in additional bureaucracy for the customs authorities."
"The gradual expansion of the list, on this occasion by more than one third, will, at some point, mean that the customs systems reach their data capacity limits."
"Therefore, I am calling for a simplification of the fundamental principle and, for that reason, I have abstained."
"As well as congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Moreira, with whom I agree on the need for periodic reviews to update the lists of pharmaceutical products eligible for duty-free treatment, I must point out that, thanks to the new mechanism introduced, end consumers will be the ones who benefit."
"Indeed, I voted in favour because I believe it is important to periodically review the list of pharmaceutical products that are exempt from customs duties, in view of the rapidly changing product environment in the pharmaceutical industry."
"All Member States have supported previous reviews and support the product coverage of the fourth review."
"I therefore commend the work done and confirm my vote in favour."
"The addition of these further 718 substances to the existing list of 8 619 products benefiting from bound duty-free treatment upon importation into the EU has met a consensus in the pharmaceutical industry and other stakeholders in the revision process, and thus deserves my support."
"in writing. - This text basically concerns the proposal inviting the Council and Parliament to authorise the addition of a further 718 pharmaceutical and chemical products to the already existing list of 8 619 products benefiting from bound duty-free treatment upon importation into the EU."
"It is rather a technical text."
"Our group has voted in favour."
"We are in favour of the proposal for a regulation providing for duty-free treatment for specified active ingredients because they concern pharmaceutical and chemical products that are essential to the pharmaceutical industry."
"The review became necessary both to include new products and remove others."
"This decision was made by agreement with the interested parties and with the unanimous consent of all participants and all Member States."
"I agree that the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Ukraine should be renewed for another five-year period."
"This decision will offer both the Community and Ukraine the opportunity to continue, to improve and strengthen cooperation in areas of shared scientific and technological interests."
"The objective of this cooperation is to help Ukraine become more actively involved in the European Research Area."
"Such cooperation will help Ukraine to support its science management systems and the reform and restructuring of research institutions, thus creating the conditions for the establishment of a competitive economic and knowledge society."
"Both Ukraine and the European Union should obtain mutual benefits from their scientific and technological progress, implementing special research programmes."
"By applying this decision, it will be possible to exchange specific knowledge and pass on practical experience for the benefit of the research community, industry and citizens."
"I therefore agree strongly that Ukraine and the European Union should continue to cooperate closely in this field."
"Scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and other countries is vital for technological development, with all its advantages, including in relation to improving people's quality of life."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of the renewal of the agreement between the EC and Ukraine."
"The Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Ukraine was signed in Copenhagen on 4 July 2002 and came into force on 11 February 2003."
"Given the importance of the science and technology sectors to the EU, its capacity in these areas and the important role that it can play alongside Ukraine, I believe that the renewal of the agreement is in the Union's interests, in the sense of continuing to promote cooperation with Ukraine in areas of science and technology that are shared priorities and which are beneficial to both parties."
"I hope that the agreement that has just been renewed continues to prove advantageous to both parties."
"The Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Ukraine was concluded in Copenhagen on 4 July 2002 and came into force on 11 February 2003 with the aim of encouraging, developing and facilitating cooperative activities in areas of common interest, such as research and development in science and technology."
"I voted in favour of this agreement as I believe that its renewal contributes to strengthening the creation of the common European Research Area, in that it serves as a catalyst for the strategic partnership between the EU and the Ukraine."
"I therefore hope that this renewal will bear fruit for both parties."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which concerns the reconsultation of Parliament on previous Council decisions concerning the renewal of the agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Union and Ukraine."
"At a summit in Ukraine in November 2008, both parties confirmed their interest in renewal of the agreement for a further five years and I welcome this."
"I welcome the approval in the European Parliament of the draft decision sanctioning the renewal of the Agreement for Scientific and Technological Cooperation with Ukraine."
"The importance of these sectors to economic and social development in both the European Union and Ukraine is acknowledged through the cooperation in various areas of common interest: the environment and climate change, health, green energy, the information society, industry and agriculture, etc."
"Ukraine's academic community must seriously assess the competitive advantages it gains from collaborating with the EU and use the European funds as a means of developing its strengths and not only as an alternative source of funding."
"Scientific cooperation is undoubtedly a key element of the European Research Area and will pave the way for access to the global networks in this sector."
"The Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Ukraine, in force since February 2003, has been a success and has played an important role for both parties."
"Its renewal therefore confirms this success and we hope that it will continue to do so in the future."
"For many years, Ukraine existed in a situation of constitutional and political disorder."
"At last, it has a president capable of taking decisions."
"I support Mr Yanukovych's inclination to bring order to Ukraine."
"We must use all available opportunities to help Ukrainian industry integrate with the European Union as soon as possible."
"In this context, the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Ukraine is advantageous to both parties."
"Secondly, it represents an important political signal to all political forces in Ukraine that we support the policy of putting law and regulations in order."
"In today's modern world where technical developments are so short-lived, making cooperation in scientific and technical fields easier will be of benefit to both sides."
"As the renewal of the agreement apparently brings economic and social advantages for both sides, it is also in the interests of the European Union."
"The costs of implementing the agreement, in the form of workshops, seminars, meetings, etc. will be charged to the relevant budget lines of the specific programmes in the EU budget."
"In order to promote technical progress in the face of competition in a globalised world and in the light of the benefits which technological developments bring not only to our everyday lives, but also, for example, in the field of medicine, I have supported the renewal of the agreement for scientific and technical cooperation with Ukraine."
"I voted in favour of this resolution as I believe that the renewal of the agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Ukraine will enable the parties to achieve significant progress and mutual benefits."
"The renewal of the scientific and technological cooperation agreement between the European Community and Ukraine is extremely important in order to continue facilitating cooperation in both the shared priority areas of science and technology, which bring socio-economic benefits to both parties."
"This is why, in the plenary sitting, I have given my support to Parliament approving the renewal of the agreement, in line with what we decided in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"This agreement should enable Ukraine and the EU to benefit mutually from the scientific and technical progress made through their research programmes, at the same time enabling the transfer of knowledge to benefit the scientific community, industry and Europeans."
"With regard to specific results, the renewal of the agreement will allow the continued exchange of information on science and technology policies between the EU and Ukraine."
"It will also enable Ukraine to take part in certain areas of the European Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development and enable training to take place through mobility programmes for researchers and specialists from both sides, among other things."
"in writing. - Very easy vote, this one."
"We simply had to agree, and we did."
"Scientific and technological cooperation between the European Union and other countries is vital for technological development, with all its advantages, including in relation to improving people's quality of life."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of the renewal of the agreement between the EU and the Faroe Islands."
"The EU and the Faroes have concluded their negotiations on establishing a scientific and technological cooperation agreement, which was initialled on 13 July 2009."
"The agreement is based on the principles of mutual benefit, reciprocal opportunities to access the programmes and activities relevant to the purposes of the agreement, non-discrimination, effective protection of intellectual property, and equitable sharing of intellectual property rights."
"This scientific and technological association agreement will help to structure and improve cooperation on these matters between the EU and the Faroes, through regular meetings of its Joint Committee, in which specific cooperation activities can be planned."
"I hope that the agreement that has just been adopted proves advantageous to both parties."
"The EU and the Faroe Islands have concluded their negotiations on the establishment of an agreement on scientific and technological cooperation, with the aim of facilitating free movement and residence for researchers involved in activities covered by this agreement and in order to facilitate the cross-border movement of goods for use in such activities."
"I voted in favour of this agreement as I believe that its renewal contributes to strengthening the creation of the common European Research Area."
"I therefore hope that the renewal of the agreement will bear fruit for both parties."
"I voted against the Agreement between the European Union and the government of the Faroes on Scientific and Technological Cooperation, not because I am against scientific cooperation between the Union and the Faroe Islands, but because I believe that pressure should start to be put on the Faroe Islands so that the repeated slaughter of pilot whales - almost 1 000 of them are killed each year - stops once and for all."
"As long as these massacres are perpetrated, I shall, in future, vote against any agreement or financial aid arrangement between the European Union and the Faroe Islands."
"in writing. - The Commission negotiated on behalf of the Union an agreement with the government of the Faroes on scientific and technological cooperation in June 2010."
"I voted for this report which approves the proposal."
"The Agreement between the European Union and the government of the Faroes on Scientific and Technological Cooperation, in force since July 2009, has been a success and has played an important role for both parties."
"Its renewal therefore confirms this success and we hope that it will continue to do so in the future."
"The entry into force of the Agreement between the European Union and the government of the Faroes on Scientific and Technological Cooperation will enable the Faroe Islands to participate fully in the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities."
"Although the Faroes have a small research community, their researchers have already successfully participated in EU-funded projects."
"They have expertise in research areas linked to the geographical location of the Faroe Islands, in particular, marine resources and the environment."
"The agreement will enable these researchers to work in other areas, such as energy, food, agriculture, fisheries and biotechnologies."
"Regular meetings will help to identify common priorities in terms of research, as well as the fields in which joint efforts may be of benefit to both parties."
"Furthermore, the agreement will promote the mobility of students and researchers from higher education."
"The European Union has set itself ambitious targets in the field of technology and not only in the context of the Lisbon Strategy."
"These objectives have now been reinforced in the plan for the near future, the Europe 2020 strategy."
"This makes cooperation in science and technology even more important."
"Against this background, we should welcome the fact that a series of agreements have been reached with other countries to promote this cooperation by means of workshops, meetings and seminars, for example."
"This issue is of such great importance to the EU that a subsidy option has been made available within the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities."
"Now we are about to renew our agreement with a group of islands in the North Atlantic, the Faroe Islands."
"Unlike Denmark, the Faroes are not a member of the European Union and do not form part of the customs union."
"Instead, they have created a single economic area with Iceland."
"In order to encourage technological progress, I have voted in favour of renewing the agreement on scientific and technical cooperation with the Faroe Islands."
"I voted in favour of the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the government of the Faroes on Scientific and Technological Cooperation as I am convinced that aligning our efforts in these strategic areas can be beneficial to both parties."
"in writing. - (BG) Innovation and globalisation are the two main sources of economic development across the globe."
"They have a direct effect on productivity, employment and the welfare of citizens, and provide an opportunity to resolve some of the challenges facing the world, for example, healthcare and the environment."
"As their role is becoming increasingly visible and their characteristics clearer, policies must be adapted to them."
"Japan is a country with traditions in the area of science and technology."
"I therefore voted in favour of collaboration with them."
"Scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and other countries is vital for technological development, with all its advantages, including in relation to improving people's quality of life."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of the conclusion of the agreement on this matter between the EU and the government of Japan."
"The importance of science and technology to the development of Europe and Japan and the fact that both are confronted by similar challenges regarding economic growth, industrial competitiveness, employment, sustainable development and climate change mean that both the EU and Japan have expressed their desire to improve and intensify their cooperation in areas of shared interest, such as science and technology."
"In 2003, negotiations were started on a future scientific and technological cooperation agreement, which resulted in the draft text on which we have just voted."
"We cannot forget that this partnership could be of the utmost benefit to Europe, as Japan is one of the world's leading countries in terms of research investment, which amounted to 3.61% of gross domestic product in 2008, with more than 81.6% of that coming from the private sector."
"I hope that the agreement that has just been adopted proves advantageous to both parties."
"The European Union and Japan are facing common challenges in terms of economic growth, industrial competitiveness, employment, social and regional cohesion, sustainable development and, perhaps most importantly, the need to adapt their economies to their ageing societies and the current financial crisis."
"They also have similar research priorities, such as life sciences and communication sciences, so this agreement will serve to enhance cooperation in areas of common interest, such as life sciences, information and communication technologies, and environmental technology linked to climate change and renewable energy."
"I voted in favour of this agreement as I believe that its adoption contributes to strengthening the creation of the common European Research Area, in that it serves as a catalyst for the strategic partnership between the EU and Japan, which is already one of the leading countries in terms of investment in research (reaching 3.61% of the gross national product in 2008, with more than 81.6% of this coming from the private sector)."
"in writing. - The Commission has negotiated an agreement on cooperation in science and technology with Japan, signed on 30 November 2009."
"I welcome this report, which approves the agreement, but I believe that the EU must work to intensify its relationship with Japan."
"The agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Japan has been under negotiation since 2003, and has only just been concluded."
"Given Japan's considerable importance in terms of scientific and technological research, the agreement that has just been concluded is hugely significant for both parties."
"This agreement gives the green light to the European Union to make use of technology from Japan, which is one of the most progressive industrial nations."
"This is a great step forward on the part of the European Union."
"However, I should like to hope that this cooperation will be two-way, as the experience of working with Japanese companies indicates that the Japanese side does not always abide by this principle."
"I am voting in favour, in the hope that not only Japan but also the European Union will benefit from this cooperation."
"Japan is a role model in the field of technological development."
"Japanese technology is always state-of-the-art, whether it involves hybrid drive systems or entertainment products."
"The country is not only well-known for exporting its high-tech products; they are also of great importance to its citizens."
"For example, in Japan, it is already possible to pay for goods or services securely using a mobile phone."
"The shortages of the so-called rare earths that are essential for the electronic components of the latest technological products is the result of the Chinese strategy to ensure that these substances are in short supply and to keep their prices artificially high."
"All of this will accelerate the search for alternatives."
"Cooperation in the field of science and technology and the renewal of the relevant agreement deserve our support not only for these reasons."
"The requirements of the Lisbon Strategy and the Europe 2020 strategy, where the European Union has set itself ambitious targets in the field of technology, also play a role here."
"Europe and Japan are facing common challenges in terms of economic growth and sustainable development, so the conclusion of this agreement is worth celebrating, as it allows for the enhancement of their cooperation in the area of science and technology, with considerable advantages for both parties."
"The EU and Japan are facing very similar challenges in terms of economic growth and industrial competitiveness."
"Moreover, the need for socio-economic adjustments due to the ageing of their populations and the current economic crisis means that they are both facing similar situations and have similar priorities in terms of research, development and innovation."
"I am voting in favour of this recommendation, which gives Parliament's approval for an agreement to be made between the EU and Japan on cooperation in science and technology, because of the need to maximise the potential for cooperation between these two parties in the fields of science and technology."
"The agreement, which is scheduled to run for five years, is aimed at the mutual benefit of both parties, and provides for regular meetings between the EU and Japan with a view to planning specific cooperative activities, including coordinated calls for proposals."
"All of this should enable the EU and Japan, which already cooperate on significant projects such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, to consolidate their cooperation even further in areas of common interest such as life, information and communication sciences, manufacturing technologies and the environment, including climate change and renewable energy sources."
"I voted in favour of the report because I consider it to be right and necessary to mobilise the Solidarity Fund for victims of the floods that occurred in previous years."
"In this case, the EU funds will directly benefit those affected."
"Scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and other countries is vital for technological development, with all its advantages, including in relation to improving people's quality of life."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of the conclusion of the agreement in this area between the EC and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan."
"Scientific and technological cooperation between the European Union and Jordan is one of the priorities in the collaboration between the EU and Mediterranean countries through the European Neighbourhood Policy and the EU's strategy of strengthening ties with neighbouring countries."
"It is also closely in line with the Jordanian government's executive programme for promoting a process of lasting socio-economic reform in the country."
"I think it is beneficial for both sides to cooperate on joint research, technical development and demonstration activities in different areas of common interest, with the fruits of this cooperation to be used according to their common economic and social interests."
"The EU has been fostering a close partnership with Jordan, a country that is endeavouring to act as a force for moderation and reform in a politically turbulent region."
"The EU has aimed to support Jordan in its efforts through a relationship that emphasises close cooperation on democratic reform and economic modernisation."
"As the President of the Delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries, I am pleased to vote in favour of this report, the aim of which is to strengthen cooperation in science and technology between the European Union and Jordan."
"Since 2008, the EU and Jordan have been negotiating a scientific and technological cooperation agreement, which must now be adopted."
"Partnership with Jordan is of great interest in the context of Euro-Mediterranean relations, because, in addition to its great potential, the country can act as a platform for scientific cooperation with the other countries of the region."
"Furthermore, Jordan has a well developed network of universities and higher education institutions, and well equipped research and technological applications centres in fields that are very relevant to Europe, such as agriculture and agronomy."
"The country is also well integrated into international and regional scientific networks."
"I hope that the agreement that has just been adopted proves advantageous to both parties."
"Scientific and technological cooperation between the European Union and Jordan has been one of the priorities of the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement, which has been in force since 2002."
"I voted in favour of this agreement as I believe that its renewal contributes to strengthening the creation of the common European Research Area, in that it serves as a catalyst for the strategic partnership between the EU and Jordan, which, by virtue of its strategic location in the Middle East, may have an impact on promoting scientific cooperation with countries in that region."
"in writing. - The Commission negotiated an agreement between the EU and Jordan on scientific and technological cooperation."
"This was signed on 30 November 2009."
"I voted for this report, which approves the agreement."
"The agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has been under negotiation since 2008, and has only just been concluded."
"This agreement is important in view of the possibilities that it provides for exchange between Europe and this Middle Eastern kingdom."
"It is also worth pointing out that there is a great deal of development under way in Jordan in terms of higher education, which may contribute greatly to the success of this cooperation."
"Despite the fact that the environmental issues are overshadowed by the conflict in the Middle East, there is likely to be a need for more advanced technological solutions in these regions."
"The drinking water strategies of both Jordan and Israel are gradually leading to a reduction in the flow of the Jordan River and an increase in the pollution of the water."
"Against this background, there will be a high level of demand for technological developments, for example, in the field of water and sewage treatment plants."
"Scientific and technical cooperation is important, in order to enable knowledge to be shared and to lay the foundations for new technological developments."
"For this reason, I have voted in favour of renewing the agreement with the Kingdom of Jordan."
"Cooperation on scientific and technological research between the European Union and Jordan is identified as a priority in the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which has been in force since 2002."
"I therefore believe that the conclusion of this agreement on scientific and technological cooperation between the EU and Jordan is to be welcomed, as it is a further step towards strengthening this partnership."
"I hope that aligning our efforts in these strategic areas will be beneficial for both parties."
"Scientific and technological cooperation between the EU and Jordan is given as a priority in the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement between the two parties, which came into force in 2002."
"Negotiations to establish an agreement between the EU and Jordan on scientific cooperation therefore began in 2007."
"Parliament's approval for the conclusion of the agreement is a step in the right direction."
"My support for the conclusion of the agreement is based on my conviction that it will bring the EU closer to Jordan, which has significant capabilities in the field of science and technology."
"Jordan has a large network of universities and research centres."
"Moreover, it is hoped that Jordan will act as a catalyst for scientific cooperation in its region."
"It has strategic planning for research, and is in a position to cooperate internationally in sectors such as energy, sustainable development, health and agriculture, among others."
"These areas are in line with the European priorities set out in the seventh framework programme."
"This is why it is important for this agreement to be approved, as it will enable the EU to move closer to its Mediterranean partner in the field of science and technology, thereby creating mutual benefits."
"in writing. - With this vote, the European Parliament, having regard to the draft Council Decision (11362/2010), having regard to the draft agreement between the European Community and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on Scientific and Technological Cooperation (11790/2009), having regard to the request for consent submitted by the Council in accordance with Article 186 and Article 218(6), second subparagraph, point (a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (C7-0182/2010), having regard to Rules 81, 90(8) and 46(1) of its Rules of Procedure, having regard to the recommendation of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, 1. Consents to the conclusion of the agreement; 2."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, as it addresses the resolution adopted by Parliament on 25 February and the Green Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy, with regard to the need for regional cooperation and sustainability beyond EU waters."
"This resolution repeals the fisheries partnership agreement which entered into force on 9 October 2006 for a three-year period and makes for continuity in the fishing activities of Community vessels, which is of particular interest to the EU as it contributes to the viability of its tuna fishing sector in the Pacific Ocean."
"It also allows for a sharp reduction in tuna fishing opportunities in the East Atlantic on account of the conservation and management measures adopted by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC)."
"Furthermore, it should be noted that this agreement will allow for guaranteed revenue for the Solomon Islands, which will be used to support the implementation of its national fisheries policy, thus contributing to the principle of sustainability and sound management of fisheries resources."
"I congratulate Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves for having brought the attention of this Chamber to the renewal of the partnership agreement with the Solomon Islands."
"With the new Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has acquired greater powers over partnership agreements in the fisheries sector, and with the reform of the common fisheries policy, the new agreements involve a commitment to promote responsible and sustainable fisheries in all areas of the world."
"I voted in favour because this agreement involves promoting cooperation at sub-regional level, thus respecting the European goal of strengthening the framework of regional fishery management organisations as a means of promoting fishery governance."
"I am also convinced that European Union relations with the Solomon Islands, where the sea is full of tuna, also represent a considerable economic interest."
"In this way, it is possible to support the economic efficiency of the European Union tuna fishery supply chain in the Pacific, guaranteeing access to 4 000 tonnes of fish, a considerable quantity for the industry and the European market and partly offsetting the foreseeable reduction of tuna fishing opportunities in the eastern Atlantic."
"We four Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have chosen to vote against the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Solomon Islands."
"Our decision is based on a genuine fear that tuna will be exploited and overfished."
"Two species in particular - the yellowfin and bigeye tuna - are endangered, and therefore fishing of these species should, as far as possible, be discontinued."
"This fisheries agreement threatens tuna stocks, as it gives the green light to all catching of fish as long as European fishermen provide financial compensation for each tonne of tuna caught."
"This will very likely result in uncontrollable overfishing and, in the worst case scenario, it may threaten the survival of tuna in the region."
"The Treaty of Lisbon strengthens the European Parliament's powers regarding Fisheries Partnership Agreements (FPAs) by requiring Parliament's prior approval."
"In this context, I voted for the report on the FPA between the EU and the Solomon Islands because I believe that it furthers the aim of promoting responsible, sustainable fishing, thus serving the legitimate interests of both parties."
"We Social Democrats chose to vote against the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with the Solomon Islands."
"We believe that the monitoring of the agreement is inadequate and that the agreement does not take due account of the environment in relation to the overfished stocks."
"The EU currently has 16 Fisheries Partnership Agreements (FPAs) in force."
"Through these, the EU fleet has access to fish stocks which, for one reason or another, the partners cannot or do not intend to catch."
"We are currently aiming to renew the FPA with the Solomon Islands for another three years."
"As the rapporteur says, 'the EU is proposing to provide the same financial support to the Solomon Islands under the new agreement as it did under the previous agreement, even though fewer fishing authorisations are to be granted and the allowable catch volume is lower'."
"This is especially relevant when we consider that, under the previous version of the FPA, four Portuguese longliners were fishing in the exclusive economic zone of the Solomon Islands, which is now no longer possible because no fishing opportunities were negotiated for longliners."
"It is true, however, that a clause has been included allowing the introduction of new fishing opportunities where necessary."
"The 2002 reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP) introduced the concept of partnership, with the objective of supporting the development of the national fisheries sector in partner countries."
"Since 2004, the agreements have been termed 'fisheries partnership agreements' (FPAs)."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has given Parliament increased powers regarding FPAs."
"Under Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), Parliament now has to give its prior consent to the conclusion of an agreement."
"In February 2004, the Solomon Islands and the European Community signed a three-year FPA, which entered into force on 9 October 2006."
"I agree that this agreement should be repealed and replaced by a new version, which belongs to a set of three agreements with the central and western Pacific region that also comprises partnership agreements with Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia."
"Under the agreements with African and Pacific countries, part of the EU's financial contribution is aimed at supporting national fisheries policies based on the principle of sustainability."
"The signing of bilateral fisheries agreements between the EU and third countries guarantees access for EU fleets to sources of fish that are significant in quantitative and qualitative terms whilst, at the same time, channelling financial resources to these countries that often come to make up a large proportion of their budget available for pursuing policies in numerous areas, not just fisheries policy."
"That is also true of this agreement."
"We voted for this report, but we still have serious reservations about how the agreement has been implemented up to now, some of which are quite rightly shared by the rapporteur."
"I am referring, amongst other things, to the fact that the Joint Committee never met while the agreement was in force; the fact that the terms under which responsible fishing practices would be implemented in the exclusive economic zone of the Solomon Islands have not been set out; and the failure to establish how catch volumes will be monitored."
"These are failures that put the achievement of the agreement's goals at serious risk, and they must not be repeated when it is renewed."
"The Commission has committed to doing everything to prevent this from happening again: it must now meet that commitment."
"in writing. - I voted for this proposal on a Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and the Solomon Islands, but with serious reservations."
"EU development cooperation policy and the common fisheries policy have to be brought into a coherent, complementary and coordinated relationship, so that together they can help to reduce poverty in countries which have untapped fishery resources that they are seeking to exploit sustainably, while endeavouring to develop their local communities"
"The EU has several fisheries partnership agreements, which give it access to different fishing zones in exchange for funding, which is channelled into the economy of the countries with which they conclude these partnerships. This is a way for the EU to help developing countries, while also making good quality fishing zones accessible to EU fishermen, so as to enhance their economic activity, which is vital for the EU economy."
"On this particular occasion, there are two problems that must be solved methodically and purposefully."
"The first is fishing quotas and the second is the exchange of knowledge and experience of the processing and conservation technologies for the catch and Pacific Ocean production."
"I hope that all the aspects listed in the agreement will focus on encouraging cooperation and the mutual exchange of experience."
"Bilateral fisheries agreements between the European Union and third countries are of significant economic benefit to the EU."
"A new agreement is currently being negotiated between the EU and the Solomon Islands."
"The disadvantages of the new agreement are an increase in the contribution to be paid by shipowners, a lower level of profitability for the EU than other tuna fisheries agreements and the same financial support from the EU in return for lower catch quotas."
"According to the rapporteur, the benefits of the agreement include the fact that the Solomon Islands need foreign exchange reserves to maintain their macro-economic stability, that the agreed reference tonnage of 4 000 tonnes of fish is a relatively large amount for the EU, and that there is a need to pursue cooperation on a regional basis with a view to achieving sustainability beyond EU waters."
"I have abstained, because the advantages for the EU are not clear enough in relation to the costs."
"I voted in favour of the proposal for a partnership agreement between the European Union and the Solomon Islands because I believe that that agreement essentially serves the interests of both parties."
"I believe that cooperation on a regional basis is an excellent way of achieving sustainability beyond EU waters and fostering fisheries governance."
"Indeed, as well as providing a stable legal framework for both parties, the agreement will provide the Islands with guaranteed revenue for at least three years, and this will be used in part to finance the implementation of their national fisheries policy."
"Maintaining fisheries relations with the Solomon Islands is very much in the EU's interest, since this will help to enhance the viability of the EU tuna fishing sector in the Pacific by giving access to a large quantity of fish."
"I congratulate Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves on having brought the renewal of the Partnership Agreement with the Solomon Islands to the attention of this House."
"I voted in favour because, under the agreement, cooperation is to be promoted at subregional level, thus meeting the European objective of strengthening regional fisheries management organisations and, in that way, fostering fisheries governance."
"Lastly, I support the rapporteur's recommendations to the Commission, in particular, to ensure that the European Parliament and the Council receive equal treatment as regards the right to be duly informed, so that they may properly monitor and assess the implementation of international fisheries agreements."
"I voted in favour of the conclusion of this fisheries partnership agreement as I believe that it essentially serves the interests of both parties, on the one hand, by allowing the EU access to 4 000 tonnes of tuna per year, a fairly substantial quantity for the EU industry and market and, on the other, by providing the Solomon Islands with substantial financial resources to be partly channelled into the implementation of its own sectoral fisheries policy."
"However, I believe that everything must be done to remedy the problems rightly highlighted in the report."
"in writing. - The Fisheries Agreement between the European Community and the Solomon Islands expired last October."
"The new Protocol is valid from 9 October 2009 to 8 October 2012 and is already provisionally applied pending the European Parliament consent procedure."
"According to Article 43 paragraph 2 and Article 218 paragraph 6(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the European Parliament can either consent or decline to consent."
"Although the majority of the EP has voted in favour, our group, the Greens/EFA, has voted against."
"I share the rapporteur's concern that the Commission should examine not just the specific issue of the standard rate and other rates of value added tax (VAT), but also the broader issue of a new VAT strategy, including its scope and derogations."
"Given the increasing complexity in terms of rates, the VAT system is not keeping pace with the development of the internal market, putting businesses at a disadvantage, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It should be recalled that Parliament has warned the Commission that the VAT system, as currently devised and implemented by the Member States, has weak points that are exploited by fraudsters, resulting in tax losses of billions of euro."
"I welcome the Commission's intention to launch a Green Paper on revising the VAT system with the goal of creating an environment that is more favourable to business, and a system that is simpler and more robust for the Member States."
"I voted for this report."
"With its proposal, the Commission proposes to extend by 5 years the current requirement for EU countries to have a minimum standard VAT rate of 15%."
"Therefore, the proposal will have no consequences in terms of tax rates."
"The Commission proposes that the extension should take effect on 1 January 2011 for a period ending on 31 December 2015."
"To maintain the degree of harmonisation of rates already achieved, the Commission has twice submitted proposals providing for a standard rate band with a minimum rate of 15% and a maximum rate of 25%."
"The band was derived from the rates applied in practice in the Member States, where the standard rates had always varied between 15% and 25%."
"In both cases, the proposals to approximate rates were amended by the Council which kept only the principle of the minimum rate."
"I agree with the Commission that the purpose of the extension is not only to give businesses the necessary legal certainty, but also to allow further evaluation of the appropriate level of the standard VAT rate at EU level."
"I believe that in the future Green Paper on the review of the VAT system, the Commission should not only examine the specific issue of the standard VAT rate and other rates, but also the broader issue of a new VAT strategy, including the scope of VAT and the derogations."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Casa, for having drawn up this report, which allows us to take a fresh look at a topic as fundamental as VAT and tax harmonisation."
"I support the rapporteur in his assertion that the current VAT system, partly due to an increase in its complexity, has not kept pace with growth in the internal market and actually places companies and small and medium-sized enterprises at a disadvantage by considerably affecting their competitiveness."
"The current tax laws also display numerous loopholes that may be used to illegal advantage by tax dodgers."
"I therefore support the Commission's proposal to put off the creation of a common VAT system with the aim of giving enterprises the necessary legal certainty but, at the same time, I call on the Commission to conclude its analysis as quickly as possible and draw up a Green Paper on the review of the VAT system with the involvement of this Chamber."
"I voted in favour of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal and with the amendments to it tabled by Parliament."
"I agree with the Commission's proposal for a five-year extension of the current requirement for EU Member States to have a minimum standard value added tax (VAT) rate of 15%, based on Article 113 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"As for the amendments made by Parliament, I think it is particularly pertinent that the new VAT strategy should aim to reduce the administrative burden, remove tax obstacles and improve the business environment, particularly for small and medium-sized and labour-intensive enterprises, whilst ensuring the robustness of the system against fraud."
"I think that strict control is needed over the minimum VAT rate, at a time when the transitional arrangement for the 15% level is due to be extended again."
"Furthermore, I think that we should be more concerned by the fact that an ever-increasing number of governments in EU countries are raising their VAT rate to the maximum limit in order to tackle the challenges presented by the economic crisis."
"This measure proves that there is a lack of viable solutions and is stifling the economy and people's lives."
"In this respect, I urge for excessive taxation to be avoided, with a view to adopting a definitive tax harmonisation system."
"I voted for this report as I think that the European Union needs a new VAT strategy."
"The EU must use this with the aim of cutting red tape and removing the financial obstacles blocking the development of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I also think that extending the transitional arrangement for the minimum VAT rate until 31 December 2015 can prevent structural imbalances in the European Union."
"The renewal of the minimum standard rate of value added tax (VAT) of 15% in Member States proposed by the Commission is founded on legal certainty."
"I am in no way opposed to this principle, so I voted for the proposal."
"However, I must stress how urgently deeper measures are needed in relation to this tax."
"These measures must target the European Union's fiscal competitiveness and the necessary protection of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It is increasingly evident that tax policies are not neutral."
"The success story of VAT cannot and must not prevent it from adapting to new times."
"In this proposal, which is based on Article 113 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Commission proposes a five-year extension of the current requirement for EU Member States to have a minimum standard value added tax (VAT) rate of 15%; it will therefore have no effect on tax rates."
"The Commission proposes that the extension takes effect on 1 January 2011 for a period ending on 31 December 2015."
"The purpose of the extension is not only to provide businesses with the necessary legal certainty, but also to allow for a better evaluation of the appropriate level of the standard VAT rate at EU level."
"The current VAT system, with its increased complexity not only in terms of rates, is not keeping pace with the development of the internal market, and is putting European businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, at a disadvantage."
"Furthermore, as Parliament has pointed out, the VAT system, as currently designed and implemented by the Member States, has weaknesses that fraudsters use to their advantage, costing billions of euro in tax revenue."
"This report concerns the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the minimum standard value added tax (VAT) rate of 15%, extending for another five years the current period - which was to expire at the end of this year - because they could not reach agreement on definitively standardising VAT rates."
"However, the rapporteur has taken the opportunity to give the Council some suggestions, specifically about the new VAT strategy, which he believes should aim at 'removing tax obstacles and improving the business environment, particularly for small and medium-sized and labour-intensive enterprises, whilst ensuring the robustness of the system against fraud'."
"He also takes the opportunity to insist that the Council should move towards a definitive system before 31 December 2015, while the Commission should submit legislative proposals to replace the current transitional rate by 2013."
"We will monitor this issue extremely closely, given the potential negative implications which the proposal that emerges in 2013 could have."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which examines a Commission proposal to extend by 5 years to 31 December 2015 the requirement for EU countries to have a minimum standard VAT rate of 15%."
"This is desirable in normal times, but in the present economic crisis, it is even more necessary."
"Tax competition that drove down VAT rates would be ruinous for countries trying to maintain an acceptable level of public services."
"We should remember that the current VAT system, with its increasing complexity, and not only in terms of rates, is not keeping pace with the development of the internal market."
"This puts European businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), at a disadvantage."
"Furthermore, as Parliament has pointed out in the past, the VAT system, as currently designed and implemented by the Member States, has weaknesses that fraudsters use to their advantage, costing billions of euro in tax revenue."
"The focus of the new VAT strategy should therefore be to reform the VAT rules in a manner that actively promotes the objectives of the internal market."
"The new VAT strategy should aim to reduce administrative burdens, removing tax obstacles and improving the business environment, particularly for SMEs and labour-intensive enterprises, whilst ensuring the robustness of the system against fraud."
"This is an extremely important issue for the development of European entrepreneurship as a whole."
"There must be a harmonised system of VAT rates, applicable to all European Union countries."
"There must be a comprehensible long-term tax system as regards all types of entrepreneurship and industry."
"Only then can we reckon on success in fiscal policy."
"Currently in Latvia, individual politicians fail to appreciate the danger of an unstable tax system when plugging the budget deficit by continually amending tax legislation."
"This significantly endangers a future reduction of the tax burden and leads to the liquidation en masse of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I consider that the European Commission's initiative is timely."
"Minimum value added tax rates are one aspect of the efforts to harmonise European tax rates."
"However, we must oppose these moves towards harmonisation."
"On the one hand, they could lead to attempts to introduce tax sovereignty for the EU through the back door and, on the other, regulations of this kind represent an intrusion into the sovereignty of the Member States."
"The Member States must retain the power to set their own tax rates, because each country must decide for itself on its own priorities, as this depends on the extent to which the state spends money in different areas."
"All of this is also an expression of Europe's historical development."
"We must reject calls for minimum tax rates so that the pressure to conform, the amount of EU red tape and the centralism of Brussels can all be reduced."
"I strongly oppose the extension of the mandatory levy of a minimum standard VAT rate of 15% for a further five years."
"The EU should be focusing on cooperation on tax fraud, because billions of euro are being lost in the value added tax systems in particular."
"There are some approaches in this area which are worthy of further discussion."
"The report extends the transitional system introduced by Council Directive 92/77/EEC, which introduced a minimum rate of VAT, establishing that the standard rate could not be lower than 15%."
"It is now common practice to set minimum rates because we have not yet achieved a permanent tax harmonisation system in the Union for indirect taxation."
"As far as VAT is concerned, this allows us to prevent the increasingly sharp differences between the standard rates applied in Member States from causing structural imbalances and distortions of competition."
"The deviation between standard rates applied currently ranges between 15% and 25% and is sufficient to guarantee the correct operation of the internal market."
"The postponement will make it possible to give companies the necessary legal certainty but also to carry out further evaluations with regard to a satisfactory level of standard VAT rates throughout the EU."
"The Commission is also called on to publish a Green Paper on a new VAT strategy as quickly as possible and to start consultation on future tax harmonisation."
"I voted in favour, in the expectation of a tax harmonisation system that will lead to a single VAT rate throughout the Union."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Casa, whom I congratulate on the work and collaboration within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The aim of the report is to extend by a further five years the current requirement for EU countries to have a minimum standard VAT rate of 15%."
"As well as emphasising the importance of a minimum standard rate, the report goes further and stresses the need to devise a new VAT strategy, insofar as the current system, with its increased complexity not only in terms of rates, is not keeping pace with the development of the internal market."
"As Mr Monti, too, pointed out in his report on the relaunch of the single market, the lack of uniform rates and a different cost of living in the various Member States could create conditions that undermine the spirit of the single market."
"This puts European businesses, and especially SMEs, at a disadvantage."
"Furthermore, the European VAT system, as currently designed and implemented by Member States, is often the subject of cross-border fraud, something which costs billions of euro in tax revenue."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Casa, on having drafted this report, which enables us to address once again the fundamental issue of VAT and tax harmonisation."
"I agree with the points made by the rapporteur, namely, that the current VAT system is not keeping pace with the development of the internal market but, on the contrary, is placing businesses and SMEs at a disadvantage by significantly affecting their competitiveness."
"I therefore support the Commission's proposal for an extension so as to create a common VAT system to give businesses necessary legal certainty but, at the same time, I urge the Commission to conclude its analyses as soon as possible and to draft, with the help of this House, a Green Paper on the review of the VAT system."
"I am voting in favour of this report."
"Nevertheless, I must point out that the successive postponement of definitive regulation of value added tax (VAT) is symptomatic of the deadlock into which European integration has fallen."
"Even if the Commission tabled a proposal for revising the VAT system soon, we are all aware that the various Member States' different interests, as expressed in the Council, will end up blocking a proposal to make rates more uniform."
"We would do well to remember that, despite being a regressive tax, VAT has been, and continues to be, the emergency tax measure put at the service of the austerity policies imposed by the Council and the Commission."
"Pressure for the so-called 'budgetary consolidation' of the Member States is now a major obstacle to the convergence of VAT rates."
"If we recall that the suggestion of a 'European VAT', put forward by the Commission as a source of income for the Union, was immediately rejected by several Member States, we will have to acknowledge that asking the Commission for 'a new VAT strategy' seems to make little sense."
"I voted in favour of this report, which focuses on the Commission's proposal for a five-year extension of the current requirement for EU Member States to have a minimum standard value added tax (VAT) rate of 15%."
"In line with what the rapporteur says, it is important to acknowledge that the VAT system itself needs to be thoroughly overhauled so as to actively promote the objectives of the internal market, thus helping to create a more favourable business environment, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I therefore wholeheartedly welcome the Commission's stated intention to launch a Green Paper on the review of the VAT system."
"in writing. - We are in the majority in Parliament voting in favour of this text, which states that the European Parliament, having regard to the Commission proposal to the Council, having regard to Article 113 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union pursuant to which the Council consulted Parliament (C7-0173/2010), having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee, having regard to Rule 55 of its Rules of Procedure, and having regard to the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, approves the Commission proposal as amended; calls on the Commission to alter its proposal accordingly, in accordance with Article 293(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; calls on the Council to notify Parliament if it intends to depart from the text approved by Parliament; asks the Council to consult Parliament again if it intends to amend the Commission proposal substantially; instructs its President to forward its position to the Council, the Commission and the national parliaments."
"This report on the common system of value added tax and the duration of the obligation to respect the minimum standard rate is only to be welcomed."
"It will fix the minimum standard rate at 15% up to the end of 2015."
"While the European Commission repeatedly proposed introducing a maximum rate of 25%, the European Council did not support this."
"At the same time, the standard rate does not currently exceed 25% in any Member State."
"Estonia, where the standard rate of VAT is 20%, is among the 19 Member States where the rate is 20% or more."
"Regarding this aspect, I wish to point out that I strongly supported the extension of the 15% minimum rate, which will give every Member State the option to decide how high its rate should be."
"In addition, this report ensures legal certainty for our entrepreneurs, who will know that for the next five years, European legislation will prevent the standard rate of VAT from rising."
"The European Commission's proposal provides for a five-year extension of the current requirement for EU Member States to have a minimum standard value added tax (VAT) rate of 15% until 15 December 2015."
"The idea is to maintain the harmonised fiscal structure, with two obligatory rates of VAT and harmonisation within a 10% band: in other words, between 15% and 25%."
"The Member States undertake to avoid extending the current span above the current lowest standard rate applied by them."
"I agree with the rapporteur that, with its increasing complexity, the current VAT system is not keeping pace with the development of the internal market."
"I also hope that in the future, the European Commission will analyse not just this issue of the standard rate of VAT but also the general subject of revising the current system, including its scope and derogations, and that it will commit to drawing up a new strategy for this tax."
"I voted for the report for the reasons given above."
"Obviously, I have voted in favour of Mr Casa's report."
"Moreover, I agree, not only with the rapporteur's stance on the directive, but also with the tenor of the notes to his report. Since as early as 1993, the European Union has been operating a transitional system for VAT."
"Attempts to move to what is known as a definitive system have so far failed."
"However, this is no reason why we should not keep on trying."
"The VAT system is not just a question of rates and ranges, but also one of a simple, legally certain scheme which works well in the internal market, which is tailored to SMEs and is resistant to fraud."
"The fact that the Commission plans to pick up this thread is good news. I would like to encourage the competent Commissioner to tackle this difficult dossier."
"I believe that in the new VAT strategy, particular attention should be paid to the reform of VAT rules, in keeping with principles that actively promote attainment of the objectives of the internal market."
"As the rapporteur points out, the current VAT system, with its increased complexity, not just in terms of rates, is not keeping pace with the development of the internal market."
"In January 2009, the VAT rate in Lithuania increased from 18-19%, and to 21% in September."
"It is important that future changes do not dent foreign investor interest in Lithuania."
"We must propose favourable tax planning opportunities."
"According to the new VAT strategy, we should aim to reduce the administrative burden, remove tax obstacles and improve the business environment, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Prior to adopting a final decision, the Commission should fully consult public and private sectors."
"VAT rates should be discussed during these consultations, as well as broader issues, such as the goal of setting a maximum rate and VAT structure and operational framework alternatives."
"Therefore, I look forward to the Commission's Green Paper on the review of the VAT system."
"I voted in favour of the European Central Bank (ECB) annual report because I think that measures to maintain a low inflation rate, close to 2%, while increasing liquidity in the markets, prevented the collapse of many financial institutions."
"However, I recognise that the full recovery potential of the ECB's measures did not unfold because their liquidity was not always passed on to the real economy."
"It should be recalled that the crisis started out as a financial one, becoming an economic one, too, later on."
"The governments of the Member States and the ECB have had to respond to the most serious crisis since the 1930s."
"We have witnessed a contraction of gross domestic product, a drop in economic activity and an increase in budget deficits, resulting in reduced tax receipts and creating unsustainable public debt: it has been difficult to achieve figures comparable with those existing before the crisis."
"This situation is a result of the lack of structural reforms within the EU, which is so obvious in the events in Greece and other countries of the euro area."
"I therefore think that it is important to deal with the weaknesses in the financial system at global level and learn all the lessons from the crisis by improving the quality of risk management and the transparency of the financial markets."
"The report on the European Central Bank annual report shows the European Parliament to be the most consistent champion and supporter of the attack by capital on the workers throughout the European Union."
"It basically repeats the anti-grassroots decisions of the EU summit in October to create a controlled bankruptcy mechanism, to introduce stricter terms in the Stability Pact and apply it to the letter and to impose penalties on Member States which fail to comply with those terms."
"It welcomes the money package made available at EU and Member State level for the stock exchange and other sectors of capital, in order to ensure that it remains profitable during the capitalist crisis."
"It supports all the barbaric measures against the working and grassroots classes applied by the bourgeois governments in all the Member States of the EU."
"In order to get the EU out of the capitalist economic crisis, the political representatives of capital propose that the rate of capitalist restructurings in all the Member States be stepped up, so as to maintain the profitability of the monopoly groups, at the expense of the workers, who are being called upon to pay for the crisis."
"Ireland is the most recent and will not, of course, be the last example of the tragic consequences in store for the workers as a result of encouraging the sovereignty of the monopolies and their profitability."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on the European Central Bank report on the basis of the excellent report by my German colleague, Mr Balz."
"Having become a European institution with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the ECB, whilst being independent, cannot be indifferent to the wishes of the European people, represented by their parliaments, or of the Member States' governments."
"I therefore support the request for the ECB's work and decision making to be transparent."
"During the crisis, the ECB adjusted interest rates down to 1% and continued unprecedented non-standard measures to support credit throughout 2009."
"Those measures have borne fruit."
"I support the idea that lifting these measures needs to be well timed and coordinated with national governments."
"In particular, it would be helpful if the ECB were to carry out a global, rather than regional, assessment of inflation in its monetary policy for setting intervention rates to exit the crisis."
"In the European Parliament's resolution on the ECB annual report 2009, it is noted that the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact were not always fully respected in the past and therefore, it is necessary to ensure that in future, this pact is applied more coherently and effectively in the Member States."
"I supported this resolution and believe that a monetary union needs strong coordination of economic policies and for the current gap in macro-prudential supervision to be closed by establishing a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB)."
"I feel that under the concept whereby the ESRB only gives warnings and recommendations with no actual enforcement, it is impossible to satisfy the principles of effective implementation and responsibility, and the ESRB cannot declare an emergency by itself."
"Therefore, the ESRB must be given greater powers."
"It is particularly important to call on the European Commission not to simply limit itself to amending the regulation on credit rating agencies, which would increase the liability of these agencies, but to present a proposal on the establishment of a European Credit Rating Agency which would facilitate an objective assessment of the economic and financial position of the Member States."
"I voted in favour of the resolution by Parliament as I agree that the financial crisis in some countries within the euro area is a serious matter and reflects a certain dysfunction of the euro area, and because I believe that this shows the need for reform and for stronger coordination between the various economic policies."
"I also agree with the call for the unrestricted and more coherent application of the Stability and Growth Pact, as I believe that the pact should be complemented by the development of an early warning system to detect possible inconsistencies, such as in the form of a 'European semester', in order not only to enhance surveillance and economic policy coordination so as to ensure fiscal consolidation, but - beyond the budgetary dimension - to address other macro-economic imbalances and strengthen enforcement procedures."
"The monetary union needs strong and enhanced coordination of economic policies to be robust."
"I would like to call upon the Commission to put forward proposals to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact by including specific targets for closing the competitiveness gap between European economies in order to stimulate job-creating growth."
"I greatly appreciate the efforts of the European Central Bank."
"I believe, in fact, that the ECB has shown that it is capable of meeting the objectives it is set and that its level of technical expertise has always proved equal to the situations faced, including in times of severe crisis such as now."
"However, the very existence of unexpected variations in the key macro-economic indicators should make us stop and think about the intermediate mechanisms at work between monetary policy and the real economy."
"I therefore think it necessary not only to set up other supervisory and control authorities to support the ECB, but also and, above all, to cover those spheres of responsibility which, hitherto, have not been seen as important."
"In particular, Estonia's forthcoming accession to the euro area is a source of concern."
"An enlarged monetary union requires, in fact, greater internal cohesion."
"The macro-economic performance of that Baltic state aside, in accordance with the standards required by the EU, greater convergence must be achieved among the euro area countries, not least to increase the capacity for action on the part of the institutions, which safeguard its stability and value."
"I voted for the annual ECB report for 2009."
"The ECB continued its policy from 2008, setting an inflation rate target of close to 2%, while increasing liquidity in the markets."
"The ECB therefore adjusted interest rates down to 1% and continued the non-standard measures introduced in 2008 throughout 2009."
"The five key elements of the enhanced credit support were fixed rate full allotment, an expansion of the list of collateral, longer maturities for refinancing operations, liquidity provisions in foreign currencies and financial market support through a measured but significant covered bond purchase programme."
"Close coordination is required with national governments in EU countries in connection with their own programmes, especially in the light of the crises which have hit Greece and, now Ireland, and of the gloomy prospect of them spreading."
"I voted for the 'ECB annual report 2009' as I consider that it proposes a number of measures which could benefit the European Union's economy."
"These include creating a permanent mechanism for protecting the euro area against speculative attacks, monitoring the activities of current credit rating agencies and devising a possible European credit rating agency."
"As rapporteur for my political group, I also highlighted the limitations of the Stability and Growth Pact in its current form."
"The pact should be supplemented by an early warning system which will enhance the coordination of economic policies within the European Union."
"I voted for this report because I advocate reform and stronger coordination of the economic policies within the euro area, given the dysfunction that the financial crisis has caused in the current system."
"The proposals aiming to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact must take into account the competitiveness gap between European economies in order to stimulate growth that pays particular attention to job creation."
"The crisis that we are experiencing is an opportunity to revise and improve things that have gone wrong in the past."
"Strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact and supervising compliance with it are essential to preventing future imbalances in the euro area."
"The creation of a European Systemic Risk Board and the replacing of the supervisory committees with three new supervisory authorities are measures that will be beneficial in terms of better economic supervision."
"I agree with the rapporteur when he talks about the need for prudence regarding initiatives to regulate the financial markets."
"It is as we have been arguing: better regulation does not necessarily mean more regulation."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has given the European Central Bank (ECB) the status of an EU institution, which increases the responsibility of Parliament as an EU institution through which the ECB is accountable to the European public."
"The ECB annual report 2009 deals primarily with the ECB's reaction to the crisis, the exit strategy and governance topics."
"The financial crisis which started about two years ago with the US sub-prime mortgage crisis rapidly spread to the EU and turned into an economic crisis as well, hitting the real economy."
"Real GDP in the euro area shrank by 4.1% in 2009, the average general government deficit ratio increased to about 6.3% and the public debt-to-GDP ratio rose from 69.4% in 2008 to 78.7% in 2009."
"The ECB acted correctly by adjusting interest rates down to 1% and continuing with substantial and unprecedented non-standard measures to support credit."
"That prevented the collapse of many financial institutions."
"However, liquidity has not always been passed on to the real economy."
"This crisis has clearly shown the need for greater transparency and better risk management in financial markets, sound public finances, and the urgent need to regain credibility."
"The international financial system really is amoral and immoral."
"The latest developments in the Irish crisis have reassured the banks that they will be able to carry on handsomely rewarding their shareholders and taking risks in the long term, since the Member States and the European taxpayers will always be there to save them."
"Privatisation of profits and public ownership of large-scale losses ..."
"Heads I win, tails you lose ..."
"It is paradoxical, and indeed scandalous, that the turmoil in the stock market caused by Ireland's sovereign debt is the direct consequence of the aid that the country granted to its banks - aid that has made its deficit worse than ever before and sent its debt soaring."
"Moreover, the banks that it saved, or their sister banks, are the ones that are today speculating against it."
"However, the main lesson to be learnt from all this is that the euro is a millstone round its Member States' neck and that the European Central Bank's policy, like the euro exchange rate, is geared solely towards Germany."
"The Member States that have fared best are those that have retained some flexibility with regard to their currency and their exchange rates. Their national currency, that is!"
"It is high time everyone learnt from this."
"in writing. - This initiative by the Parliament is of special importance this year as it gives MEPs a chance to give their opinion on how the European Central Bank has reacted to the banking crisis."
"How we voted on this also gave us a chance to have our say on some of the other aspects of the current economic climate, such as causes of the crisis, governance and financial market reform."
"It is important that the voice of the people's branch of the European Union is heard on such an important topic."
"I have voted to support the European Central Bank (ECB) annual report for 2009 as it clearly highlights the consistent action taken by the ECB and its primary objective of maintaining price stability."
"In the crisis of 2009, the ECB acted and reacted effectively. With independence and determination, it laid the foundations for a lasting climate of confidence."
"Our most important proposal for improvement should be put into practice consistently."
"In other words, the ECB should make its activities more transparent in order to further increase its legitimacy."
"The new Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force on 1 December 2009, made the ECB into a European Union body."
"I very much welcome this, because the ECB is primarily accountable to Parliament, a fact of which many people are not aware."
"It must continue to be able to make its financial policy decisions independently of political influence and to justify them to the citizens whom we represent."
"The ECB was, and is, a reliable ally in finding a balance between sound public finances and the necessary reduction of debt in the Member States."
"It has constantly underlined the fact that the euro area needs a stability pact with authority."
"This must be applied to the letter and must not be circumvented or undermined."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which examined the ECB's annual report for 2009."
"My group (the S&D Group) used the report to push for our core macro-economic policies, including: coordination of macro-economic policies by the Member States; a permanent crisis-management framework; a strengthened Growth and Stability Pact; the possibility of creating a European credit rating agency; credit for SMEs; and flexible exit from government support following the crisis."
"The serious economic crisis that has spread across the entire world has made itself very keenly felt in the EU."
"The response of the European Central Bank to the crisis has been effective, although it has been guilty at times of acting late or with a lack of assertiveness, particularly in relation to the policy of reducing interest rates, which was more radical and effective in the United Kingdom and the US Federal Reserve."
"We must learn from the mistakes made so that they may be avoided in the future."
"The financial crisis in some countries within the euro area is therefore a serious matter for the euro area as a whole and reflects a dysfunction of the euro area."
"This shows the need for reform and for stronger coordination of the economic policies within the euro area."
"This task must be carried out by all the states that belong to the euro area so that it can finally be consolidated and can quickly escape from the pressure that it is experiencing at present."
"The report by Mr Balz failed to bring clarity to the question of the manner in which the European Central Bank (ECB) supervised and regulated transactions and monetary policy during the crisis."
"It is merely an attempt to clothe the bank's operations in vague and cautious phrases."
"In reality, it is essential not only to define the state of affairs but also to prevent any symptoms that threaten the development of the economy."
"Only then can preparations be made in time and financial debts such as Greece's EUR 110 billion budget deficit, Hungary's EUR 28 billion budget deficit and Latvia's EUR 7.8 million budget deficit be avoided altogether."
"Nevertheless, I consider that, taken as a whole, the ECB report is a positive step."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Balz, with whom I have had the opportunity of working on this matter within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The European Central Bank has played an important and fundamental role during the economic crisis of recent years, and its representatives have often been instrumental in pointing out problems in the euro area."
"The Member States have not always listened, but the coordination provided by the Frankfurt-based institution can only be regarded in a positive light."
"The aid package put together and provided to Greece, just like the rapid responses, would not have been possible without an authority and a body such as the ECB."
"Furthermore, with the recent approval of the package on Europe's supervisory authorities, the ECB will acquire greater powers and authority to monitor and highlight anomalies in the system."
"This is essential, just as it is essential for the ECB to maintain its independence and not be under the influence of any Member State."
"The ECB annual report covers the reaction to and exit strategy from the crisis applied by the Bank during 2009."
"On the other hand, in its report, which I voted in favour of, the European Parliament sets particular store by the gradual withdrawal of the ECB emergency measures applied in 2008 as a result of the financial crisis (1% interest rate, quantitative easing and inflation below 2%)."
"This is especially important to Greece and the other states in the euro area as, in these cases, not only did the recession not end in 2009; on the contrary, it developed into a serious budgetary crisis."
"Consequently, any change of stance by the ECB will need to take account of the new situation and be applied in close cooperation with the Member States currently hit by the debt crisis."
"I am voting against this report."
"It ignores, or at least underestimates, the recessionary effect of a policy to reduce public spending being carried out simultaneously by most of the EU Member States, just as the EU was leaving behind the major recession that began in 2008."
"Accepting this report means voting in favour of abandoning the policy of concerted stimulus that was implemented in 2009."
"The neoliberal ideology that is dominant in the European Central Bank (ECB), which means that there is an ever-lurking threat of inflation, even when there is considerable untapped productive capacity, is making the euro area a hostage to the financial markets."
"This ideology has returned to remind us that austerity is not enough, and that there needs to be a nominal reduction in wages and further deregulation of the labour market."
"Since the drop in aggregate demand will affect the implementation of the budget by Greece and Ireland in 2011, the ECB will then come and tell us that the austerity policy was right, but that it did not go far enough or deep enough."
"This report embraces a real intellectual scam."
"The current economic and financial crisis has made apparent the need to implement EU reforms that can strengthen supervision and the coordination of economic policies in the euro area and restore confidence in European public finances."
"Important steps are being taken in this direction, particularly through the creation of a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), which will close the current gap in macro-prudential supervision of the EU financial system, but it is vital to move forward with proposals for strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact in order to ensure budgetary consolidation and also to address other macro-economic imbalances and strengthen enforcement procedures."
"This report, which I voted for, also draws attention to the fact that the austerity packages adopted by the governments of the Member States should not compromise their ability to promote economic recovery, with an emphasis on ensuring a balance between the process of consolidating public finances and meeting the need for investment in jobs and sustainable development, and using measures and instruments which can give a direction to the sacrifices imposed on the public, along with an end in sight."
"in writing. - This report evaluates the 2009 annual report of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the work done by the ECB during that year."
"As the statement of the European Parliament on the ECB annual report 2008 had been delayed due to the elections in 2009, not much time has passed since the European Parliament's last statement on ECB activity."
"The report on 2008 dealt mainly with the performance of the ECB in the financial and economic crisis."
"Unfortunately, the situation has not changed since then."
"Still, economic, financial and, to an increasing extent, political actions are widely dominated by the crisis."
"The ECB annual report 2009 therefore still deals primarily with the ECB's reaction to the crisis, the exit strategy and governance topics."
"Recently, the work of the European Central Bank has focused on fighting the financial crisis and on attempts at rebuilding the stability of economic and monetary union."
"Coping with the effects of such a serious crisis requires individual countries to adopt a new model of economic governance."
"The European Central Bank should support measures leading to the recovery of budgetary balance by encouraging the repayment of existing loans instead of extending new loans to economies which are heavily in debt."
"The financial crisis in individual Member States of the European Union represents a significant threat to the stability of the euro."
"It also shows the deficiencies in the operation of the euro area and draws attention to the need for reform and more effective economic consolidation in the countries of the Union."
"Care should also be taken to develop preventative mechanisms in the event of a worsening of the present crisis or if it should move into a new phase."
"The European Union and the euro area can even emerge from the crisis stronger than they were, but we must draw the proper conclusions from the experiences of recent months."
"I am convinced that the role of the European Central Bank and of the governments of individual EU Member States will be crucial in this process."
"The European Central Bank (ECB) annual report is primarily an investigation into the way in which the ECB responded to the financial and economic crisis."
"The ECB reacted quickly and intervened successfully."
"By taking a series of extraordinary measures, it was able to ease the liquidity shortages on the markets."
"However, now these measures must be dismantled cautiously and gradually, because by definition, 'extraordinary measures' must not become the rule."
"The banks and, in the meantime, the Member States which, because of the loss of confidence among the players on the financial markets, came to rely on the intervention of the ECB as an intermediary in order to access funding, must regain their independence."
"The central bank constantly emphasises the fact that it is independent, but during the recent crisis, this no longer seems to have been important enough to enable us to refer to it as independence."
"As a result of the massive capital injection in Ireland, in the form of emergency loans for the Irish banking system and the purchase of government bonds, the ECB itself is now relying on Ireland to accept the EU rescue package, so that it can once again service its loans from the ECB."
"The ECB must oppose any efforts to make it into a political body."
"The European Parliament report on the development of the civilian-military capabilities of the EU highlights the repulsive imperialist face of the EU and of the political representatives of capital."
"It is a macabre manual for implementing the imperialist interventions of the EU and committing crimes against humanity."
"It openly supports the 'new doctrine' of NATO to 'intertwine internal and external security', calling on the EU to organise and plan its civil and military forces so that it can intervene directly, using combined civilian and military means, in every corner of the planet, in the name of so-called 'crisis management' and 'to maintain peace'."
"Without mincing their words, the political representatives of the monopolies propose a series of measures to increase the efficacy of EU military missions, in order to strengthen its position in the battle between the imperialists, which is raging with unprecedented intensity both at global level and within the EU."
"Proposals include a permanent EU operations centre in the form of a 'joint crisis management headquarters', new 'integrated police units', better use of the European Gendarmerie Force, new 'Civilian Response Teams', closer collaboration with NATO, ensuring NATO can rely on the 'EU's civil capabilities' and harmonising the EU's 'development capabilities' with NATO standards."
"The ever-increasing interdependence between internal and external security is becoming clear."
"Under these circumstances, the development of policies and capabilities for crisis management and conflict prevention is actually an investment in the security of European Union citizens."
"The European External Action Service should be a major player in devising a truly comprehensive European approach to civil and military crisis management at European level and to conflict prevention, providing the EU with sufficient structures, human and financial resources to fulfil its global responsibilities."
"When setting up the EEAS, the transfer must take place of the CSDP structures, including the Crisis Management Planning Directorate, the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability, the EU Military Staff and the Situation Centre, to the EEAS, under the direct authority and responsibility of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy."
"It is the High Representative's direct duty to ensure that these structures will be integrated and operate coherently."
"Close collaboration is required between the EEAS and all the other relevant units within the Commission in order to encourage the development of a comprehensive EU approach, especially with those dealing with issues relating to development, humanitarian aid, civil protection and public health."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ehler, for having called the attention of this Chamber to a topic fundamental to the European Union, namely, civilian and military cooperation."
"I voted in favour of this report because I support the need for closer cooperation between civilian and military capabilities in order to provide effective responses to present-day crises and security threats, including natural disasters."
"I also approve of the idea of drafting a European Union White Paper on security and defence, based on systematic and rigorous security and defence reviews conducted by the States according to common criteria and a common timetable, which would define the Union's security and defence objectives, interests and needs more clearly in relation to the means and resources available."
"The recent emergency in Haiti also highlighted the need for the European Union to offer improved coordination and faster deployment of military assets in the context of disaster relief, in particular, air transport capabilities."
"Given the importance of these missions, I feel it necessary that funding should be considered more quickly and, for the sake of transparency, for one budget line to be created for each mission."
"The rapporteur successfully argues the need for a better coordination and division of tasks between civilian and military forces in crisis management."
"The distinction between the strategic and operational dimensions is still vague at present."
"I therefore support the rapporteur's proposal for the creation of a permanent headquarters responsible for operational planning and conducting military operations."
"With regard to the development of civilian-military capabilities, the Member States should set objectives that match their resources in terms of personnel deployment."
"It would also be a good idea to establish real financial solidarity between the Member States."
"Lastly, greater synergy between civilian and military research would be a big advantage, since it would help prevent repetition, duplication and, hence, unnecessary costs."
"'Si vis pacem, para bellum' ('If you wish for peace, prepare for war') said the ancients."
"Fortunately, the days of arms races are now over."
"Nonetheless, the principle that inspired the Latin phrase is still relevant today."
"There can be no serious and credible commitment to peace if the conditions are not in place to enforce it, in accordance with serious, objective rules."
"In particular, without seeking to interfere in every dispute that may arise, the EU, as a major economic and political power, should make its presence felt in cases involving interests of any kind or nature, if necessary, also by using military means to restore order and re-establish peaceful conditions, as a precondition for resolving conflicts."
"It follows that greater autonomy, together with a closer link with NATO and with the other existing bodies, can only increase Europe's authority, credibility and cohesion."
"We want the establishment of the European External Action Service (EEAS) to contribute to devising a truly comprehensive European approach to civil and military crisis management at European level, as well as to conflict prevention and peacebuilding, providing the EU with sufficient structures, human and financial resources to fulfil its global responsibilities in line with the UN Charter."
"Given that the UN Security Council has primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, close cooperation must be established between the EU and the UN in the area of civilian and military crisis management and, in particular, in humanitarian relief operations where the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) is in the lead role."
"At the same time, it is desirable for this cooperation to be strengthened, particularly in those areas where one organisation is to take over from the other, especially in light of the mixed experience in Kosovo."
"I voted for this report because I argue that effective responses to present-day crises and security threats, including natural disasters, often need to be able to draw on both civilian and military capabilities and require closer cooperation between them."
"We live in a world in which, firstly, there is ever less expectation of a conventional attack on the EU or any of its Member States and, secondly, threats are increasingly scattered across the globe, whether they are from international terrorism, cyber attacks on crucial IT systems, long range missile attacks on European targets, or piracy in international waters."
"As an organisation committed to peace preservation, conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction, and reinforcement of international security, it is therefore essential for the EU to be capable of acting as a global player in this area, capable of guaranteeing the security of its citizens within its territory."
"I therefore believe that it is essential for the EU to be committed to cooperating within the United Nations and, in the Euro-Atlantic area, with NATO, which this weekend approved its new Strategic Concept, aiming to reinforce the Alliance's ability to deal with non-conventional threats and strengthen its ties with the European Union; this includes enhancing 'practical cooperation in operations throughout the crisis spectrum, from coordinated planning to mutual support in the field'."
"The EU has committed itself to defining and pursuing common policies and actions to preserve peace, prevent conflicts, consolidate post-conflict rehabilitation and strengthen international security, in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter."
"Through its civilian crisis management, the EU already makes a clear contribution to global security, reflecting its core values and principles."
"The establishment of the European External Action Service (EEAS) should contribute further to the development of a truly comprehensive European approach to civilian and military crisis management, conflict prevention and peacebuilding, and provide the EU with adequate structures, staffing levels and financial resources to meet its global responsibilities."
"On this point, I would like to highlight the need to speed up the provision of financing for civilian missions and to simplify decision-making procedures and implementation arrangements."
"This means that the Council needs to quickly take the appropriate decisions to establish the start-up fund as outlined in Article 41 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU), after consulting Parliament."
"This report is a good reflection of the crisis of capitalism and the gunboat diplomacy with which the EU wants to respond to it, in partnership with NATO and the US."
"From the outset, the mouthpieces of the interests of big capital - the majority of Members of this House - have been seeking to cover up the historical and current responsibilities of the EU for the world's existing security problems."
"This resolution, therefore, maintains the thesis of preventative wars with the misleading argument that the 'security' of the citizens of EU countries is guaranteed by a policy of intervention, violating the sovereignty of countries and peoples and making war wherever and whenever the interests of the EU's economic groups are at stake; this will only increase with the creation of the European External Action Service."
"In reality, it is increasingly clear that the EU is now part of the threat that is hanging over people."
"At a time when workers are having important rights taken away and draconian measures are being imposed on people under the pretext of a lack of resources, the channelling of funds into arms purchases and the strengthening of the war industry should be condemned."
"in writing. - Concerning the vote on the resolution on the Ehler Report, Labour MEPs were happy to be able to give their support."
"I and my Labour colleagues are happy to support positive civilian and military cooperation and greater capacity building in order to help preserve peace, prevent conflicts and consolidate post-conflict rehabilitation."
"At this time of financial struggle across Europe, we question, however, the need for the establishment of a permanent EU operational headquarters and what added value it would bring to the positive work already being done."
"in writing. - I welcome some aspects of this report dealing with civilian-military cooperation and the development of civilian-military capabilities."
"I particularly welcome cooperation on humanitarian crises and natural disasters."
"It is necessary to provide effective responses to current crises and threats to security, including natural disasters, so we often need to be able to draw on both civilian and military capabilities and require closer cooperation between them."
"The development of the EU's comprehensive approach and its combined military and civilian crisis management capabilities have been distinctive features of the common security and defence policy (CSDP), and represent its core added value."
"The establishment of the European External Action Service (EEAS) is further contributing to the development of a truly comprehensive European approach to civilian and military crisis management, conflict prevention and peacebuilding, and providing the EU with adequate structures, staffing levels and financial resources to meet its global responsibilities, in line with the UN Charter."
"I have voted against the report on civilian-military cooperation and the development of civilian-military capabilities."
"The report describes in great detail the current developments in security policy."
"However, in my opinion, it does not provide clear, decisive and positive answers to the important questions, such as whether the EU will be able to stand on its own feet in the long term or whether it will maintain its very close links to NATO and, therefore, will hand over its foreign policy responsibilities to the USA."
"in writing. - With civil and ethnic wars gradually replacing interstate wars to dominate the scene of 21st century conflicts, the line drawn between peacekeeping and peacebuilding is increasingly blurred."
"The changing nature of conflict calls for more extensive cooperation between civilian and military capabilities."
"The highly successful EU-led Aceh Monitoring Mission (AMM) from 2005 to 2006 serves as an important example and reminder of how civilian-military synergies can anchor peace and build confidence in an unstable environment in a timely and effective way."
"While the decommissioning team, dominated by military experts, monitored the rapid and successful disarmament process, the civilian team of AMM worked to turn the process into a platform for further political dialogue and for both parties to credibly commit themselves to permanent peace."
"The application of civilian and military expertise should not be restricted by the technical labelling of the nature of operations, but should instead be decided on the basis of appropriateness and cost-efficiency."
"I voted in favour of this report because I think it plays a critical role in facilitating the further development of a non-aggressive but nevertheless coherent and competent face of EU foreign policies."
"I voted in favour of Mr Ehler's report because I believe that this is an important issue and that the report deals with it in a serious way and takes a number of aspects into account."
"Cooperation as envisaged in the report is a typical activity of peacekeeping operations, within the scope of which the military component cooperates with the civilian component (local authorities, national, international and non-governmental organisations and agencies) in order to restore acceptable living conditions and begin reconstruction."
"Such activities help to ensure and maintain full cooperation between military forces, civilian populations and local institutions, with the aim of creating the conditions necessary to help achieve the objectives set."
"It is therefore important for the European Union to support and promote this type of cooperation."
"I voted in favour of this report as I agree that, in order for the EU to meet its responsibilities to preserve peace, prevent conflicts, strengthen international security and assist populations facing disasters, it is vital to foster better coordination between civilian and military resources and to ensure that the necessary resources are available to strengthen their global crisis management abilities."
"in writing. - We abstained on this report because we keep seeing too much effort being focused on military capacities, and too little on the civilian and prevention activities."
"Once again, Parliament has voiced its strong support for the development of the EU's common security and defence policy, despite the fact that it is consistently refused an active role in shaping this policy."
"We are all aware of the added value of the policy which, above all, represents an opportunity to combine military and civilian capabilities, although in practice, as highlighted by the report, much remains to be done."
"I support the integration of this policy's institutional structures into the European External Action Service, although I would echo the rapporteur in stressing the need for the EEAS to cooperate closely with structures remaining within the Commission."
"in writing. - While we would clearly support the principle of enhanced civilian-military cooperation in certain activities, this report has an entirely different thrust."
"It is essentially about taking forward the EU's ambitions in the defence field in order to promote EU integration."
"We do not support these objectives."
"In particular: the idea of an EU Defence White Paper that would 'explicitly identify opportunities for the pooling of defence resources at EU level'; the demand for increases in staff to man duplicative EU military structures; the establishment of a permanent EU 'operational HQ, responsible for the operational planning and conduct of EU military operations'; and the idea of a vanguard group of nations to take forward defence integration using the Treaty of Lisbon's mechanism of 'Permanent Structured Cooperation'."
"There are many more examples."
"For all these reasons, we voted against the resolution."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the establishment of a common defence policy into one of the EU's concrete objectives."
"The aim is to improve the ability of the European Union to act in a crisis management role by allowing financial, civilian and military resources to be provided and used more efficiently."
"Military capabilities will be developed at an EU level among those Member States which want this by means of a Permanent Structured Cooperation (PSC)."
"Mr Ehler's report calls for the conditions for military cooperation to be laid down and for a clear definition of the PSC."
"For me as an Austrian, clear definitions are of great interest, in particular, with regard to the implementation of the solidarity clause as outlined in Article 222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the mutual assistance clause as outlined in Article 42(7) of the Treaty on the European Union, which are also called for in the report."
"The mutual assistance clause specifically states that it will not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States, which guarantees that neutrality will be maintained."
"As before, the solidarity clause leaves to the national authorities the decision on whether, and in what form, EU assistance should be requested."
"However, the citizens of Austria have become very concerned following a series of different reports in the media and, therefore, we need definitive information about these new military components of the EU."
"I voted for the report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a long-term plan for the anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay and the fisheries exploiting that stock, because it should contribute to maintaining biomass stocks at levels that will enable their sustainable exploitation, on the basis of scientific advice."
"Given the importance of anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay, the damage caused by the closure of the fishery to groups dependent on it (fishers, net menders, the canning industry, etc.) and the fact that the loss of income has not been covered by the compensatory aid granted by the Member States, it is essential to establish a long-term plan for the recovery of the anchovy stock so that fishers can start making use of these resources, without threatening this vital species for the European fishing and canning industries."
"With regard to the 10% reduction in fishing quotas and how exploitation is calculated, I believe that such measures are excessive, as they forget the economic and social impact that they could have on the industries and populations involved."
"The objective of this proposal for a regulation is to establish a long-term plan for the anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay and the fisheries exploiting that stock."
"The anchovy fishery in the Bay of Biscay has been closed since 2005 due to the poor condition of the anchovy stock."
"In order to raise the anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay to a level which allows it to be exploited sustainably, it is necessary to put in place long-term management measures to ensure that the exploitation of this stock is compatible with sustainable exploitation, thus ensuring, as far as possible, the stability of the fishery while maintaining a low risk of stock collapse."
"I welcome the approval of a long-term plan in this report rather than annual ad hoc measures for allocating fishing opportunities, so as to ensure the stability of the fisheries sector and strengthen monitoring and enforcement."
"I agree with support for the competent regional administrations in their monitoring, inspection and surveillance work, as they are closer to what is happening, and with the need to draw up and publish a report before the fishing season begins."
"The worrying conservation status of the anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay led to the closure of the fisheries in 2005."
"The result of this closure - which has had the inevitable tragic economic and social consequences, which it is always necessary in this and other cases to guard against and alleviate as much as possible - is that anchovy stocks have been recovering, making it possible to start exploiting them again."
"We believe that decisions about closing fisheries, reopening them and setting the conditions for the exploitation of their resources must always be based, first and foremost, on scientific knowledge and advice about the state of the resources."
"It is, therefore, essential for this knowledge to be as rigorous and up-to-date as possible, meaning that there must be sufficient financing for this purpose, specifically through the financial instruments of the common fisheries policy."
"Long-term plans constitute an important instrument in fisheries management, enabling the essential conservation of fisheries resources at sustainable levels to be combined with guaranteed medium-term prospects for exploiting these resources, which is indispensable for giving economic and social stability to fishing and the local communities that depend on it."
"in writing. - The anchovy fishery in the Bay of Biscay has been closed since 2005 due to the poor state of that stock."
"This report details the objectives of a plan to maintain the biomass of the stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay at a level that allows its sustainable exploitation in accordance with maximum sustainable yield, on the basis of scientific advice, and while ensuring as much stability and profitability for the fishing sector as is practicable."
"The plan is similar to other long-term plans for pelagic fisheries (such as that recently agreed for the West of Scotland stock of herring) in that it provides a harvest control rule for exploitation at high long-term yields whilst protecting against the risk of stock collapse."
"The suspension of anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay since 2005 has brought great difficulties for economic operators whose livelihoods depended on this economic activity."
"Now, five years after fishing was suspended, the stock of this species in the Bay of Biscay has recovered to acceptable levels, so it is now possible to resume fishing for it, but based on a long-term plan to keep the anchovy stock above the level where it is in danger of becoming extinct, so that this activity can once again add to this economic sector in this area."
"Although catch quotas have been introduced for the anchovy fishery in the Bay of Biscay, this does not apply to pelagic species and tuna."
"The number of fishing vessels in this area has declined from 391 vessels in 2005 to 239 vessels in 2009, which has had a significant influence on the economy of the area."
"However, according to the rapporteur, the anchovy stock has not yet recovered."
"A new management plan is needed to resolve this problem which is linked to the anchovy stock and which does not need to be renegotiated every year."
"The rapporteur believes that the new plan should also define the control mechanisms used to inspect catch levels."
"I have abstained, because the rapporteur has explained that the articles in the plan relating to the controls are likely to be amended by a new control regulation from the Council and she does not know exactly what this involves."
"The anchovy fishery in the Bay of Biscay is of considerable social and economic importance."
"This fishery has been closed since 2005, and the fleet has declined from 391 vessels in 2005 to 239 vessels in 2009, directly affecting more than 2 500 families."
"This closure has caused serious damage to the groups concerned (fishermen, net menders, the canning industry, etc.)."
"The loss of income has not been covered by the compensatory aid granted by the Member States."
"The introduction of this plan will make it possible to remove the management of anchovy from the political negotiation in December of each year, placing it on course to achieve the objectives for the management of European resources in the long term, thereby guaranteeing sustainability and maximum yield."
"The exploitation rule defines the TAC (or total allowable catch) in the fishery for each year (from July to June of the following year), immediately after the assessment of the stock in line with the fishing seasons in May of each year, thus immediately making maximum use of this information."
"All the productive and local businesses involved await the reopening of this fishery and have made a significant contribution to drafting the paper."
"For these reasons, I am minded to vote in favour of the provision as a whole."
"The anchovy fishery in the Bay of Biscay is of great socio-economic importance."
"The fishery has, however, been closed for five years, and this has directly affected fishermen and their families, as well as the income that revolved around that employment sector, which includes net menders and the canning industry."
"Unfortunately, the aid granted by the Member States has not made up for the serious loss of income."
"This closure should therefore be reviewed and a long-term plan established to find a solution that takes the various demands into account."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of Mrs Bilbao Barandica's report."
"I did so primarily because it introduces an exploitation rule that will maximise catches, on the basis of the precautionary principle, and will provide expected maximum economic levels for that fishery."
"The anchovy fishery in the Bay of Biscay is of great socio-economic importance, and its closure in 2005 has caused great damage to groups that depend on it (fishermen, net menders, the canning industry, etc.)."
"I voted in favour of this report, as I believe that establishing a long-term plan will address the need to rationalise the exploitation of this resource, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the fishery while mitigating the risk that the anchovy stock will collapse."
"This debate on the situation of anchovy stocks and the recovery plan is, as has been said, a turning point, both for the species and for relations between the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"On this issue, our group has supported the precautionary proposals made by the Commission from the start, especially as regards: 1) the exploitation rule, (which we advocate should not be greater than 0.3); 2) the fact that the total allowable catch (TAC) should take into account live bait; and 3) the fact that any reduction of the TAC, if it is deemed necessary, should be a minimum of 25%."
"These three issues were finally accepted by the majority of members of the Committee on Fisheries, and I trust that this will be the case when we vote in plenary."
"This is clearly a paradigmatic case, and I trust that we will have learned our lesson, and that for once, we will act like holistic doctors who cure, instead of acting like forensic doctors."
"I voted in favour of this resolution as I believe that the measures presented by the Commission for the monitoring and surveillance of fishing zones are necessary."
"This resolution is an attempt to tackle the lack of information about horse mackerel stocks by establishing a formula for vessels involved in the horse mackerel fishery, regarding an annual ceiling of maximum allowable landings and catches from defined areas."
"The principal parts of the sector affected by this plan are the owners, operators and crew of pelagic fishing vessels operating in the distribution area of the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel, namely the North Sea, areas west of the British Isles, the western English Channel, waters west of Brittany, the Bay of Biscay and off north and northwest Spain, with the main objective of ensuring an exploitation of living aquatic resources that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions."
"It is also important to note that Portugal has managed to preserve its fishing interests and enjoy its historic right to fish in those areas."
"I would like to emphasise the positive solution for the benefit of small-scale coastal fisheries which is completely compatible with safeguarding resources."
"The western stocks are, economically speaking, the most significant stocks of horse mackerel living in EU waters."
"Because of this, we must think both in terms of a long-term exploitation of live aquatic resources which will provide the conditions necessary for sustainability and development, and from a social viewpoint - for the owners, operators and crews of fishing vessels."
"This is why I agree with the Commission's proposal to establish a long-term plan for the western stocks of Atlantic horse mackerel and how these stocks are to be fished."
"I voted for the report on the proposal establishing a long-term plan for the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel and the fisheries exploiting that stock, because it contributes to ensuring the economically, environmentally and socially sustainable exploitation of the stocks."
"This proposal, which is of interest to Portugal, also takes into account the specific characteristics and purposes of the fleets involved, not least the artisanal fleet, with a view to supplying high quality fresh fish to the general public."
"Defending fishing along with the economic and social interests involved - over and above food interests - is not the same as defending the right to fish without rules or limits."
"We know that fishery resources are finite and that intensive fishing means there is no time for the exploited populations to reproduce in sufficient numbers."
"It is therefore important to create plans to maintain and conserve fish stocks, seeking to reconcile the economic and social interests at stake with the preservation of the species, which is essential to the long-term maintenance of fishing opportunities."
"With the amendments that have been tabled and adopted, this report defends traditional horse mackerel fishing and, in particular, enables 30 Portuguese vessels to continue fishing in the Bay of Biscay, which is crucial to the national interest, as is clearly pointed out by Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves, the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for this report."
"This proposal is an attempt to tackle the lack of information about horse mackerel stocks by establishing a formula for vessels involved in the horse mackerel fishery, taking into account an annual ceiling of maximum allowable landings and catches of horse mackerel from defined areas."
"This formula is based on the most reliable scientific and biological indicators available at present for the development of the stock."
"I welcome the inclusion of respect for the activity of artisanal fleets which traditionally specialise in this type of fishery for the purposes of local consumption of fresh fish, so zones should not be established too far from the coast."
"I would like to highlight the important role that Parliament has played in repealing and amending the Commission's delegated acts on this matter."
"Multiannual plans constitute important instruments in fisheries management, enabling the essential conservation of fisheries resources at sustainable levels to be combined with guaranteed medium-term prospects for exploiting these resources, which is indispensable for giving economic and social stability to fishing and the local communities that depend on it."
"We therefore welcome the adoption of this report, as well as the adoption of the amendment tabled by our group regarding the zonal distribution of total allowable catches (TAC), which we consider crucial to an economically and socially fair approach to managing stocks."
"When limits to fishing activity are set, coastal and artisanal fishing, whose purpose is to supply the public with fresh fish for consumption, should not be treated in the same way as industrial fishing, which is geared to industrial processing and export."
"In order for fishery resources management to definitely take biological and environmental issues into account as well as economic and social ones, the specificities of the fleets and the destination of the fish must be acknowledged as aspects to be taken into consideration when setting TACs."
"This report I have provides a long-term management plan for one of the most important fish stocks in Europe."
"The long-term horse mackerel plan will ensure that stocks will be able to reach the maximum sustainable level in future."
"The proposal was originally put forward by the Pelagic Regional Advisory Council, a proposal outlining the importance of the European pelagic sector as regards the sustainable management of fish stocks."
"Members from Spain and Portugal wanted to create two areas for the total allowable catch; that recommendation does not make sense and would be to the detriment of the Irish pelagic fleet."
"I succeeded in modifying those amendments in the final vote."
"This report is one of the first fisheries legislative initiatives adopted under the Treaty of Lisbon, and therefore some procedural delay was involved."
"in writing. - Atlantic horse mackerel has grown in importance in my own constituency and last year, some GBP 2 million worth of the fish was landed into Scottish ports by foreign boats alone."
"This figure shows that it is of importance to a number of nations and it is important that the stock is properly managed."
"I fully agree with Mr Gallagher that the western stock should be dealt with as a single stock, and I believe that the fishing nations involved should have the right to cooperate in managing this important resource."
"in writing. - This proposal aims at ensuring an exploitation of living aquatic resources that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions."
"While it is still on the first reading, there is a possibility of introducing amendments at the further stages."
"The general direction of this proposal is positive and thus it should be given time for others to have their say."
"in writing. - The proposal establishes a long-term plan for the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel and the fisheries exploiting that stock."
"The Commission laid down a legal management instrument for the stock of horse mackerel according to available conservation reference points and long-term sustainability considerations."
"The proposal aims at ensuring an exploitation of living aquatic resources that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions."
"The establishment of a long-term plan for the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel and the fisheries exploiting that stock is crucial for the efficient and proper use of fisheries resources."
"In this way, and provided that the rules are followed, the fish stocks will not collapse and it will be possible to exploit these resources sustainably."
"In this report, it is also important that Portugal has the opportunity to maintain its previous catch levels, as this is vital to maintain a healthy fishing industry, an industry which has suffered many setbacks in recent times."
"During a time when overfishing of stocks is becoming more widespread, we need more discussions about introducing catch quotas and, consequently, also about how these can be adhered to and monitored."
"However, scientists have not yet succeeded in accurately determining the level of fish stocks, in this case, of the Atlantic horse mackerel."
"As a result, all the measures that are taken are based on estimates."
"Nevertheless, these estimates must be used to establish the total allowable catches."
"I have abstained because the report does not focus in sufficient detail on the economic aspects of mackerel fishing."
"I voted in favour of Mr Gallagher's report because I support its content and message."
"I believe in fact that, as science develops, the values used for the fixing of biological references could be subject to new and different scientific advice."
"In these circumstances, it is obvious that the plan should provide for the possibility of adapting the reference factors."
"I agree with the rapporteur as regards area access for vessels fishing horse mackerel."
"It is advisable, in fact, to create a more flexible rule than that suggested by the Commission."
"It must be possible for vessels fishing in one area to land the catch in a port in another area."
"I believe, therefore, that a system whereby the master of a fishing vessel has to keep a record of catch and location is feasible and fair."
"Multiannual plans are a fundamental instrument for ensuring that the exploitation of fishing resources takes place under sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions."
"I have therefore supported this report on the proposal establishing a multiannual management plan for the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel, and I welcome the fact that the amendment put forward by Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves has been adopted, as it is essential for ensuring that the artisanal fishery is protected, along with Portugal's interests in this matter."
"in writing. - The dispute among the institutions centres around what part of the fisheries management plan is related to setting the TAC, and therefore is the sole responsibility of the Council."
"A few Member States think that Council alone should decide the whole plan, but that view is not widely supported, not even by the Council's legal service."
"Most feel that the mathematical rule that sets the TAC should be decided by the Council, rather than by codecision."
"On 1 December 2009, the day on which the Lisbon Treaty entered into force, the Committee on Fisheries had an 'indicative vote' on the amendment that had been tabled by Mr Gallagher and others, but we did not proceed to the final vote on the draft report as amended."
"The aim was to give the rapporteurs (Mr Gallagher on horse mackerel and Ms Bilbao Barandica on anchovy) a political mandate to negotiate with the Council."
"Finally, after almost a year of dithering on the part of the Council, the Committee on Fisheries decided to proceed to a full vote in committee to put pressure on the Council to move."
"In economic terms, the western stock of horse mackerel is the most important in EU waters."
"The European Commission proposal establishes a long-term plan for this stock as well as the fisheries exploiting it."
"It is desirable to ensure an exploitation of living aquatic resources that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions."
"This proposal could even serve as a model for future multiannual plans dealing with the regulation of fishing opportunities within European Union waters."
"I support the amendments tabled in Parliament's Committee on Fisheries to create greater flexibility when determining the biological reference factors and how the total removal amounts are calculated by setting upper and lower limits, as well as greater coordination with the legislation establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy."
"I am therefore voting in favour of this report."
"The Baltic Sea has been classified as a 'particularly sensitive sea area' (PSSA) by the International Maritime Organisation's Marine Environment Protection Committee."
"This places the Baltic Sea among the most precious and most sensitive marine ecosystems in the world."
"I voted for the provisions contained in the document according to which we must pave the way for the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks, without any need for marketing standards to be lowered."
"In order to limit effectively the discard of an excessive number of juvenile and under-sized specimens belonging to target or non-target species, it is important that the fishing industry should be encouraged to use the most selective fishing gear and not to fish in areas in which there are large numbers of under-sized fish and non-target species."
"We must begin a review of the discard system and I feel that this will be one of the most important issues in 2011 as we debate the reform of the EU's common fisheries policy."
"We are all following the effects on the environment of human activity and mass fishing with great concern, which we share regarding dwindling stocks and uncontrolled industrial fishing."
"On account of this, I am voting for the introduction of the sustainable exploitation of live aquatic resources and a review of the protected areas in the Baltic Sea."
"I voted for this report because it calls for restrictions on fishing for flounder and turbot in the Baltic Sea."
"There is a pressing need for industrial fishing in the Baltic Sea to be stopped."
"As there is a lack of reliable scientific data on the basis of which fish catches in industrial fisheries can be assessed, it is essential that full documentation of catches should be introduced immediately, together with full monitoring on the vessels engaged in these fishing activities."
"I agree with the European Parliament's position that it is necessary to take immediate action under the common fisheries policy to settle the issue of industrial fishing in the Baltic Sea, bearing in mind that, from an environmental point of view, such fishing is harmful to the Baltic Sea's ecosystem."
"We must take into account the fact that the Baltic Sea is among the most precious marine ecosystems in the world, and that the Baltic Sea region has been classified as a 'particularly sensitive sea area' (PSSA)."
"Furthermore, the climate in the Baltic Sea is changing, and different species of fish are adapting to this, meaning that their migration and spawning patterns are also changing."
"For this reason, I agree with Parliament's call for the Commission to carry out a review of the marine protection areas in the Baltic Sea."
"For the European Union, and especially for a country like Portugal that has a calling to the sea and to fishing, as well as large-scale fishing and canning industries, it is essential to maintain fishing as a viable and sustainable economic activity."
"Portugal needs fishing and, therefore, needs the sea to remain able to provide us with fish and species to remain able to reproduce."
"For this very reason, I agree with the rapporteur when he says that 'in order to prevent by-catches effectively and limit the discard of an excessive number of juvenile and under-sized specimens belonging to target or non-target species, it is absolutely vital that the fishing industry should be encouraged to use the most selective fishing gear and not to fish in areas in which there are large numbers of under-sized fish and non-target species'."
"In order to prevent highgrading and limit the discard of an excessive number of juvenile and under-sized specimens, it is absolutely vital that the fishing industry should be encouraged to use the most selective fishing gear and not to fish in areas in which there are large numbers of under-sized fish and non-target species."
"I believe that bringing in a complete ban on discards in the case of flounder or other fish belonging to the flounder family is inappropriate, as this will have a negative impact on flounder stocks."
"This ban on discards might also have the perverse effect of being used as an argument to legalise the large-scale fishing of under-sized cod in the Baltic Sea."
"It is worth pointing out that the Baltic Sea has been classified as a 'particularly sensitive sea area' (PSSA) by the International Maritime Organisation's Marine Environment Protection Committee."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which backs a proposal designed to simplify administration but does not make substantive changes to the restrictions on fishing for flounder and turbot in the Baltic Sea."
"Fishing has to be a sustainable economic activity over the long term, and this is only possible with the careful management of fishery resources."
"The concerns raised by the rapporteur are therefore legitimate and take into account the need for species protection and biodiversity conservation."
"I therefore agree with the prohibitions and restrictions adopted here."
"Given the limited fish stocks in the Baltic Sea, we must strictly regulate the catch of valuable fish species."
"It is important for this purpose clearly to define the task of the competent European Union organisations, so that monitoring can be implemented and restrictions imposed on the illogical exploitation of marine resources."
"It is essential to impose quotas in order to allow fish resources in the Baltic Sea to recover."
"A clear signal should be sent to all parties engaged in fishing that the irrational exploitation of fish resources could have dire consequences."
"Increasing numbers of fish species in the Baltic Sea are under immediate threat."
"For example, fewer cod are being caught in the Baltic than was the case 15 years ago and the fish are smaller and of poorer quality."
"One of the major contributory factors to this decline is industrial fishing and the way in which by-catches are handled."
"Traditional, small-scale, inshore fisheries are, in some circumstances, able to guarantee that fish stocks are managed sustainably."
"I have abstained, because the report clearly states that no reliable scientific data is available on this subject."
"I voted in favour of the resolution."
"Experience gained via the use of a discard system in the Baltic Sea shows that the system works well and is practicable for certain species of fish."
"Species making up by-catches may have a low market value, they may be completely unsuitable for human consumption, or it might be illegal to land them."
"The foundations are therefore being laid for the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks, without any need for marketing standards to be lowered."
"In order to prevent by-catches effectively and limit the discard of a number of juvenile and under-sized specimens, it is absolutely vital that the fishing industry should be encouraged to use the most selective fishing gear and not to fish in areas in which there are large numbers of under-sized fish and non-target species."
"Variable closed periods should also be introduced that fit in with fish spawning cycles."
"The climate in the Baltic Sea is changing, and different species of fish are adapting to this, meaning that their migration and spawning patterns are also changing."
"In the light of these considerations, a review of the protection areas would appear necessary."
"I voted in favour of this report as I believe that it is vital to promote the sustainable management of marine resources, so as to be consistent with the objective of preserving fish stocks in the Baltic, which is one of the most valuable and sensitive ecosystems in the world."
"in writing. - The detailed technical rules for fishing in the Baltic Sea (mesh size, closed areas, etc.) are included in Council Regulation 2187/2005."
"However, prior to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Council often took short-cut measures to adopt such rules quickly by including them in the regulation on quotas."
"For instance, Council Regulation (EC) No 1226/2009 fixing quotas for 2010 has provisions related to technical measures, namely Article 7 on the prohibition of highgrading, and in Annex III on the restrictions on fishing for flounder and turbot."
"After Lisbon, this is no longer legal, so Council Regulation 2187/2005 must be amended."
"That is the sole purpose of this proposal, and it was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Fisheries."
"Next year, the European Parliament will debate the reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP)."
"I agree that this process must include measures to improve the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources and the effective management of marine resources."
"As the International Maritime Organisation has indicated, the Baltic Sea is a 'particularly sensitive sea area'."
"This places the Baltic Sea among the most sensitive marine ecosystems in the world, but we also must not forget the human side of this issue which is not mentioned in the report."
"The fishing industry has deep-rooted traditions in Lithuania."
"Although the fisheries sector accounts for a relatively small proportion of Lithuania's GDP, it is particularly important for the Lithuanian economy."
"Regions of Lithuania that are dependent on fishing have suffered significant economic and social difficulties in recent years due to declining fishing levels and stock conservation policy."
"In Lithuania, it is now becoming increasingly difficult to make a living from fishing related activities."
"Due to low pay, such work is unattractive to young people."
"Consequently, Lithuania and other EU Member States must continue to implement most of the policies defined under the European Fisheries Fund."
"This assistance will help to create new jobs, will increase the value of fishery products and will promote eco-tourism, etc."
"in writing. - We abstained on the Bilbao Barandica, Gallagher and Ferreira reports on the grounds that they contained beneficial and harmful proposals in the same instrument."
"However, we voted in favour of the GrÃ³barczyk report, despite having misgivings about some of its content (e.g. its suggestion that the discard system might have worked well for certain species of fish - we are opposed to the discard system completely)."
"We voted in favour of it because it promised a review of the discard system."
"This is about as much as we can hope for within the confines of the common fisheries policy."
"On the whole, I agree with the proposed amendments, given that the introduction of alien species is one of the main reasons why ecosystems are being thrown out of kilter and, along with the destruction of natural habitats, one of the biggest contributory factors implicated in global biodiversity loss, as is acknowledged by the Commission."
"I therefore support the proposals laying down conditions for the introduction of alien and locally absent species, by strictly defining the requirements with which closed aquaculture facilities will have to comply, as well as the need to supervise facilities, the aim being to ensure the technical requirements proposed by specialists."
"Particularly at a time when a new European strategy in this area is being launched, aquaculture requires substantial support for scientific research and technological development in the area of farming native species so as to enable greater diversification."
"I agree with the amendments to ensure Parliament's involvement in this area by adapting the old comitology provisions to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"First of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferreira, for drafting this report, for which I voted in favour."
"Recent surveys have revealed a need to develop the European aquaculture sector and intensify scientific research in the field of native species breeding."
"In this way, it will be possible to guarantee improved safety, quality and diversification of products offered to consumers and therefore ensure greater environmental protection."
"With regard to the introduction of exotic species in closed aquaculture systems which, according to the Commission, primarily concerns 'aquaculture and restocking practices', I believe that this practice must be accompanied by strict monitoring of these facilities, of the systems and the activities for transport of these animals in order to prevent any escapes that could create disturbances in native ecosystems and natural habitats, representing one of the major factors in terms of making a significant contribution to biodiversity loss on a global scale."
"I voted for the report concerning the use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture, since it will make it possible to strengthen the requirements to which closed aquaculture facilities and the transport of species should be subject, so as to minimise the impact on ecosystems and biodiversity."
"The European aquaculture sector has more than 16 500 companies, a global annual turnover in excess of EUR 3.5 billion and employs approximately 64 000 people, both directly and indirectly."
"Moreover, with fishery stocks becoming scarce, aquaculture is creating innumerable opportunities for European industries."
"Relaxing the introduction procedure for alien and locally absent species in aquaculture, as is being proposed, must be balanced by strictly defining the requirements with which closed aquaculture facilities will have to comply, as well as by the necessary supervision of the facilities, the aim being to ensure that the technical requirements proposed by specialists will all be properly taken into account and observed."
"The Commission's proposed amendment to the present regulation is based on the outcome of the IMPASSE project, a concerted action focusing on the environmental impact of alien species in aquaculture."
"This project proposes an operational definition of a closed aquaculture facility, tightening up and expanding on the definition currently in use, according to which 'the degree of risk associated with alien species could be reduced considerably, possibly to an acceptable level, if the potential for escape of target and non-target organisms is addressed during transportation and by well-defined protocols at the receiving facility'."
"I voted in favour of this report as I agree with the need to dispense with the permit requirement for introductions and translocations for closed aquaculture facilities, thus freeing operators of that administrative formality."
"Regarding the report's fundamental issue, as we stated during the debate - the relaxation in the introduction procedure for alien species in aquaculture, in 'closed facilities' - must go hand in hand with the most precise possible definition of the requirements with which such facilities will have to comply, in keeping with up-to-date technical and scientific information."
"The supervision of facilities must also be ensured before they open and while they are operational."
"The sustainable development of aquaculture demands substantial support for scientific research and technological development in the area of farming native species."
"These species must be given preference over alien ones, so as to enable the diversification of production and supply of foodstuffs, along with an improvement in quality, while also making for greater environmental security."
"As regards the process of drawing up the report, I welcome the fact that the Commission has incorporated the proposals adopted by the Committee on Fisheries in its proposal for a regulation."
"The only thing I find regrettable is that it has been considered indispensable to formally table a new proposal, leading to a delay in formalising the agreement at first reading."
"in writing. - Whilst aquaculture is an important source of both jobs and food, it is important that the wider environment is protected from potential threats."
"The existing legislation strives to do this and today's proposal will not undermine those efforts."
"Accordingly, I supported this report."
"While fish stocks in the world's oceans are slowly being depleted and catch yields are reaching their limits, the farming of fish and shellfish in aquaculture has been growing in importance in recent years."
"Aquaculture production is consequently a growth sector, which is being afforded the necessary attention with this report."
"The proportion of aquaculture facilities established inland, such as pond fish culture or flow-through systems, show higher growth rates than other food production sectors, and production in these facilities already exceeds that of maritime facilities."
"Pond fish culture in particular has a long tradition: fish and crustaceans have been farmed for hundreds of years, mostly in artificial ponds."
"Closed aquaculture systems clearly provide enormous ecological advantages as well as advantages with regard to the antibiotics problem."
"I support the report, which calls for important framework conditions for closed aquaculture facilities and strictly defines the prerequisites for the introduction of exotic fish species."
"In order to prevent disruption to native ecosystems through the optimum introduction of exotic species, it is important to support closed system farming."
"in writing. - The Ferreira report deals with the amendment of Council Regulation No 708/2007, which established a framework governing aquaculture practices in relation to alien and locally absent species."
"This framework is now under revision after the completion of the so-called IMPASSE project, whose aim was to develop guidelines for environmentally sound practices for introductions and translocations in aquaculture."
"I voted for the report."
"The introduction of alien species is one of the main reasons for global biodiversity loss and the disturbance of ecosystems on Earth."
"The introduction of alien species in aquaculture must therefore give rise to an exact definition of the requirements with which closed aquaculture facilities will have to comply, and the supervision of the facilities."
"The transportation of target and non-target species should also be subject to strict rules and supervision."
"For these reasons, I voted for this report."
"I believe, however, that research and development for the purpose of farming native species should be strengthened so as to reduce the risks associated with introducing exotic species and promote more sustainable production."
"The introduction of alien species is one of the main factors in the disturbance of ecosystems, along with the destruction of natural habitats, and one of the main reasons for global biodiversity loss."
"Relaxing the introduction procedure for alien species in aquaculture must be balanced by a strict definition of the rules with which closed aquaculture facilities will have to comply, in accordance with the outcome of the IMPASSE project, as well as being subject to supervision, the aim being to ensure that the technical requirements proposed by specialists will all be properly taken into account and observed."
"The sustainable development of European aquaculture demands substantial support for scientific research and technological development in the area of farming native species, so as to enable the production and supply of foodstuffs to be diversified and quality to be improved, while also guaranteeing greater environmental security."
"Alongside the destruction of natural habitats, the introduction of alien species into our ecosystems is one reason for the global loss of biodiversity."
"More and more species are dying out in aquacultures, which is leading to long-term damage to the entire ecosystem."
"I have abstained, because the report does not go into sufficient detail about the actual problems involved."
"The introduction of alien species is one of the main reasons why ecosystems are being thrown out of kilter and, along with the destruction of natural habitats, one of the biggest contributory factors implicated in global biodiversity loss."
"The introduction of alien species into Europe's coastal seas and inland waters is due, in a great many cases, to 'aquaculture and stocking practices'."
"The relaxation in the introduction procedure for alien species in aquaculture must go hand in hand with an exact definition of the requirements with which closed aquaculture facilities will have to comply and with the necessary supervision of the facilities, the aim being to ensure that the technical requirements proposed by specialists will all be properly taken into account and observed."
"The sustainable development of European aquaculture demands substantial support for scientific research and technological development for the purpose of farming native species, so as to enable production and the supply of foodstuffs to be diversified and their quality improved, while also making for greater environmental security."
"I therefore hope that there will be strong encouragement to bring this about."
"I voted in favour of this report in view of the fact that the results of the IMPASSE project have revealed that 'the degree of risk associated with alien species could be reduced considerably, possibly to an acceptable level, if the potential for escape of target and non-target organisms is addressed during transportation and by well-defined protocols at the receiving facility'."
"It therefore makes complete sense to dispense with the permit requirement for introducing alien species into closed aquaculture facilities."
"Reducing this administrative burden and the cost of permit applications is an important incentive for the aquaculture sector."
"Provided it is accompanied by a strict definition of the requirements with which closed aquaculture facilities will have to comply, as well as by adequate monitoring of compliance, it will not compromise the necessary protection of biodiversity and the environment."
"in writing. - The Commission's proposal deals with amendments to a regulation on the use of alien species in aquaculture based on the IMPASSE project, which focused on the environmental impact of alien species."
"This project has produced an operational definition of a closed aquaculture facility, which tightens up and enlarges upon the definition currently in use and embodies an approach whereby the degree of risk associated with alien species could be reduced considerably."
"In the light of the above results, the Commission is proposing that introductions and translocations involving the use of closed aquaculture facilities be exempted from the permit requirement, thus dispensing operators from that administrative formality."
"As the rapporteur notes, the introduction of alien species is one of the main reasons why ecosystems are being thrown out of kilter and, along with the destruction of natural habitats, one of the biggest contributory factors implicated in global biodiversity loss."
"Many of these introductions into Europe's coastal seas and inland waters are due to 'aquaculture and stocking practices'."
"With this in mind, the rapporteur tabled an amendment to specify that 'closed aquaculture facilities' were limited to those on land, in order to reduce the possible survival of escapees."
"Other amendments concerned the comitology provisions."
"The use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture damages natural ecosystems that deserve protection from the EU, causing global biodiversity loss in particular."
"The IMPASSE project is concerted action on the environmental impact of alien species in aquaculture, which has demonstrated the need to prevent the escape of these species and of biological material during transportation."
"I welcome this European Parliament report because it is committed to biosecurity and, at the same time, to speeding up the administrative formalities relating to the permit requirement for introductions and translocations for closed aquaculture facilities."
"Clearly and rigorously defining 'closed aquaculture facility', as well as the regularly updated listing of all such facilities by Member States, will lead to the sustainable development of this sector."
"The Member States must supervise the facilities themselves and the means by which species are transported."
"I also support the commitment to scientific research and technological development as a means of reducing this sector's harmful effects on natural ecosystems."
"Finally, I would highlight the fact that this regulation was amended using the ordinary legislative procedure of codecision, as provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"in writing. - UKIP opposes any EU management of our industries, as it should be up to national elected governments to decide on the future and any potential subsidy of coal mines."
"However, in this case, the EU is making special arrangements for governments, outside of normal State aid rules, for greater flexibility to manage subsidies to coal mines."
"Amendments 25 and 36 are asking for a greater period of such flexibility before normal State aid laws would apply - which UKIP can go some way to support."
"UKIP has abstained on these two amendments and the final vote because although we do not support any EU State aid laws (as it should be up to national governments to decide subsidy levels), giving greater flexibility to Member States and lengthening this period is beneficial and much more democratically accountable, putting power back into the hands of governments to make these decisions."
"I supported this report."
"Although it still only represents a small part of the EU energy market, the coal mining industry ensures jobs for those EU citizens working in it and economic development in the sparsely populated and remote regions where most coal mining companies are located."
"I agreed with the amendments according to which the deadline for the closure of uncompetitive coal mines will be extended until 2018, with the possibility of keeping mines open if they fail to become competitive in the set period."
"When uncompetitive mines are closed, it is important to guarantee that the necessary long-term funding is allocated to ensure environmental protection and rehabilitate former mining sites."
"In some regions, mines are the only form of industry and their closure will mean that many people will be made redundant."
"It is therefore essential to ensure that they are provided with assistance on a multiannual basis and various labour market measures, such as retraining, implemented to create the conditions for them to return to the labour market."
"I therefore supported the European Commission's proposal to allocate such assistance until 2026."
"I voted for Mr Rapkay's report as I support, amongst other measures, the extension of the deadline for closing uncompetitive coal mines."
"In this regard, I think that this will be an attempt to avoid a massive wave of job losses, with Romania, Spain and Germany being the EU Member States hit hardest by the new regulation."
"I believe that the operation of uncompetitive mines should be discontinued in line with the closure plan, only if they fail to become profitable by the specified deadline."
"I want to encourage aid to be granted degressively to cover production losses as part of a well-defined mine closure plan."
"From 1 January 2011, half of the mines operating in Romania will be included in a closure plan."
"Against this background, I think that aid will need to be channelled more towards covering the social and environmental impact."
"in writing. - UKIP opposes any EU management of our industries, as it should be up to national elected governments to decide on the future and any potential subsidy of coal mines."
"However, in this case, the EU is making special arrangements for governments, outside of normal State aid rules, for greater flexibility to manage subsidies to coal mines."
"Amendment 25 and 36 are calling for a greater period of such flexibility before normal State aid laws would apply, which UKIP can go some way to support."
"UKIP has abstained on these two amendments and the final vote because, although we do not support any EU State aid laws because it should be up to national governments to decide on subsidy levels, giving greater flexibility to Member States and lengthening this period is beneficial and much more democratically accountable, putting power back in to the hands of governments to make these decisions."
"Having been consulted by the Commission, the European Parliament was called on to give its verdict, this Tuesday 23 November, on the issue of State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines."
"The main stumbling block was the cut-off date for that State aid."
"The Commission proposed 1 October 2014."
"For environmental reasons, I believe it is important to diversify our sources of energy production and to promote sustainable production methods."
"2014 would therefore seem to be a reasonable cut-off date."
"However, given the social impact of mine closures and the difficulties involved in redeploying miners, support must be provided during the closure process."
"The majority of the European Parliament has therefore decided to extend the provision of State aid until 31 December 2018."
"I decided to abstain from this final vote because I believe that the most important thing is to give priority to sustainable energy sources but, at the same time, it is also important to bear in mind the economic and social consequences of mine closures."
"I decided to vote for Bernhard Rapkay's report on 'State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines'."
"This report proposes putting back the deadline for closing uncompetitive coal mines by four years: from 2014, as originally provided for in the European Commission's proposal, until 2018."
"This report also encourages the European Commission to devise a strategy for retraining the workers who will be affected by these closures."
"We must bear in mind that certain regions in the European Union are totally dependent on the mining sector economically and socially, which also includes Valea Jiului in Romania."
"The mining sector provides 100 000 jobs in the European Union."
"The ongoing economic and financial crisis, in severely affecting the economies of the 'developed' countries of the West, has shown that the economic paradigm of the efficiency and capacity for self-regulation of the markets is no longer based on reality, because reality has called for all economic and market players, especially financial market players, to act responsibly and ethically, something which they have completely failed to do in recent times."
"The disruption caused in financial terms to the entire economy shows that the industrial sector requires a huge amount of support, since it is still a sector of fundamental importance for the economy, especially the real economy."
"When taking into account the competitive and comparative advantages and disadvantages between regions, especially at international level, we must not forget that the mining industry is present in areas in which the development of sound economic and occupational alternatives should be encouraged as a preliminary step and in which welfare support provisions should be enhanced to prevent painful increases in unemployed workers whom it is difficult to redeploy."
"The report on State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines, on which we have voted, seems to me to be at least partly along these lines."
"I voted for this report as I believe that uncompetitive coal mines must be able to benefit from the State aid contribution, given that without this, the mines would close, resulting therefore in a huge wave of redundancies and very serious social problems."
"The transition period granted for making these mines profitable or closing them is important."
"Its role is, on the one hand, to ensure the provision of professional retraining for the population involved in the coal industry and, on the other, to ensure a gradual transition to cleaner energy sources."
"We Swedish Social Democrats believe it to be unreasonable, for reasons relating to both the environment and competition, to retain subsidies for uncompetitive coal mines."
"At the same time, we consider it necessary to implement comprehensive employment and environmental initiatives in those regions affected by the closures that will probably result from the discontinuation of the subsidies."
"Overall, we think that the Commission's proposal on this matter is balanced and takes good account of both of these aspects."
"The subsidies will be phased out, but this will be carefully managed, taking into consideration both jobs and the environment."
"We have therefore chosen to vote consistently in favour of the Commission's line."
"As regards the question of allowing the possibility of the continued operation of mines which become profitable during the closure period, we believe, like the Commission, that it would be wrong to include this option."
"In order for the aid that is granted to be used in the right way, it must be based on a definitive closure plan."
"With regard to the exact year in which the closure aid is to end, we have no strong preferences, but we nevertheless believe that the Commission's proposal of 2014 is more appropriate than the rapporteur's proposal of 2018."
"In the absence of a specific regulation on granting State aid to the coal industry, as the applicable regulation expires on 31 December 2010, rules need to be set out enabling some Member States that have been forced to close their coal mines to minimise the social and economic impact of that closure."
"As coal mines are concentrated in certain regions (in Germany, Spain and Romania), the social impact of simultaneous mine closures could be significant."
"In employment terms, the jobs of around 100 000 miners could be at stake; they may be unable to find jobs in other sectors as quickly as is necessary and they run the risk of becoming long-term unemployed."
"For this very reason, this proposal aims to provide the Member States with a legal framework enabling them to more effectively resolve the potential negative effects of mine closures that could occur as a result of the gradual withdrawal of subsidies, in particular, the social and environmental effects."
"It also aims to minimise distortions of competition on the internal market."
"Aid to the European coal industry is regulated by Council Regulation (EC) No 1407/2002 of 23 July 2002, which expires on 31 December 2010."
"In the absence of a new legal framework allowing for specific types of State aid to the coal industry, Member States will be able to grant aid only within the limits provided for in the general State aid rules applicable to all sectors."
"Compared with the regulation of coal, the general rules on State aid significantly reduce the chances of State aid being granted to the coal industry."
"It is therefore likely that some Member States will be forced to close their coal mines and cope with the social and regional consequences of that decision."
"I understand that due to the regional concentration of coal mines, the social impact of simultaneous closure could be significant."
"Taking into account jobs in mining-related industries, this could jeopardise up to 100 000 jobs."
"I agree, therefore, that the closure plan should be extended to 31 December 2018, along with the final closure of production units, if they do not become competitive by this date, and provided that the EU's energy needs do not require them to exist."
"This report assesses and makes positive changes to the European Commission's proposal for amending this regulation, which itself changed the period for awarding State aid to the coal industry. Without this amendment, the period would have expired on 31 December 2010."
"Now, the European Commission's new proposal is suggesting extending aid until 2014."
"However, the European Parliament has adopted a proposal, for which we voted, extending aid until 2018. The purpose of this is to take the social problem - preventing redundancies of workers and difficulties integrating them into the labour market - and the environmental problem into account, together with the aid that it advocates to resolve these problems."
"The commitment to safeguarding the maintenance of coal industries that have become competitive during the course of this process, while also ensuring that environmental and public health issues are safeguarded, is also positive."
"The need to rehabilitate former coal mining sites is also stressed, specifically: the removal of old mining equipment from the mine, making it safe, cleaning the site and disposing of waste water."
"I voted in favour of the Rapkay report and of State subsidies for the coal industry."
"Coal remains an essential part of the global energy mix."
"If coal could no longer be mined in Europe, we would have to import it from the United States or Australia."
"It takes time and a great deal of confidence to adapt to changes in social structures."
"Therefore, the European Union and Germany intend to end subsidies for non-competitive coal mines."
"The period from now until 2018 will be used to put in place the necessary restructuring measures."
"This is a successful compromise which is evidence of the far-sighted approach of everyone involved."
"Given the large number of people employed in the industry, it is important for the European Union and the Member States to make every effort to cushion the negative social and regional impact of this change and to keep the impact to a minimum."
"Therefore, I am very pleased that the European Parliament has shown its support for this view today."
"This will enable the difficult but necessary adaptation processes to be implemented in Europe and in Germany, in particular, in a balanced way and on a sound political footing."
"On the question of continuing the subsidies for unprofitable coal mines, I have gone against the line taken by my group and abstained."
"In my opinion, the vote in Parliament is based on a nationalist reflex and short-term thinking."
"I oppose the subsidies because I believe that the use of coal and the accompanying CO2 emissions in principle run counter to all our efforts to combat climate change."
"The money which we could be investing in renewable energy sources is literally being thrown into a bottomless pit."
"In my view, we should be looking for sustainable alternatives in the field of energy production."
"However, we also need alternative solutions on the labour market."
"It is obvious that mistakes have been made in the past and that there has been a short-sighted approach to employment policy."
"Given that many jobs are at stake, I would prefer to see funding being made available for retraining the workers who are affected, rather than a continuation of the coal subsidies."
"For this reason, I have decided to abstain rather than voting against the report."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report as I agree with the fundamental point that there should be 'transition' regulation in this sector."
"While coal and the mining of it contribute hugely to pollution, in some countries, they also provide huge employment."
"Therefore, the ending of some of these aids so suddenly could potentially have a serious effect on some of the Member States in the EU, but it is important for the sector to realise that they should not rely solely on these aids in the future."
"Since indigenous energy sources in the Union are rare, I believe that support for the coal mining industry is justified under the Union's policy to encourage renewable and lower carbon fossil fuels for power generation."
"However, I do not believe that this justifies indefinite support for coal mines that prove uncompetitive."
"In the light of the serious socio-economic impact of pit closures, particularly in thinly populated regions, consideration should be given to the possibility of providing help and support."
"However, in order to minimise the distortion of competition in the internal market resulting from aid, the Commission will have to ensure that precise and effective conditions of competition are established, maintained and observed."
"As for environmental protection, the Member States will have to provide a programme of measures aimed at mitigating the environmental impact of the use of coal, in the field of energy efficiency, renewable energy or carbon capture and storage."
"The pro-Europeans want to facilitate the closure of the last remaining coal mines in Europe by means of short-term State aid."
"Given that Germany and Romania generate more than 40% of their electricity from coal combustion, this means that more than 100 000 people will be sacrificed on the altar of ultraliberalism on the pretext of fair competition and 'green' political correctness, which would have us generate electricity by wind power."
"In their quest for 'renewable' energies, these countries will no doubt have to replace coal by buying nuclear-generated electricity from their neighbours."
"As a former miner myself, it makes me rather emotional to think back to all the French and European coal mines that have been closed, causing great suffering and leaving entire regions to go to ruin - regions which have thus become economic and social wastelands and have often not recovered."
"Therefore, I can unfortunately only conclude that, in this area as in so many others, the Europe of Brussels has not sought to protect our industries and hence our jobs, preferring instead to waste huge amounts of money on globalist projects that bear no relation to the problems of our fellow citizens."
"I have voted in favour of Mr Rapkay's report because the plan to phase out coal mining subsidies by 2018 is, fortunately, supported by a broad majority across all the groups."
"The example of Germany shows how a coal pact between central government, the federal states, unions and management can result in efficient coal production without the need for redundancies."
"There is now more security for 100 000 jobs throughout Europe."
"To avoid any misunderstandings, it is important to realise that these are not permanent subsidies and that the aim is not to prop up uncompetitive businesses."
"This is all about taking a responsible approach to a traditional European industry."
"The use of coal can easily be justified, either as a fuel for generating electricity or as a raw material in the chemical industry, particularly in times when resources such as oil and gas are in increasingly short supply."
"The production of a minimum amount of coal contributes to our energy security and prevents us from being dependent on imports."
"It is wrong to say that ending subsidies for coal mining will help to protect the environment."
"From a climate perspective, it makes no difference whether we use domestic or foreign raw materials."
"We must continue to support environmentally friendly coal technology and a secure energy supply using domestic products."
"An active industry policy is not a thing of the past but a task for the future, on the basis of a consistent competition strategy and a sensible social policy involving job security."
"With the expiry of the Coal Regulation on 31 December 2010, some countries would be obliged to close their hard coal mines."
"I voted to extend this regulation until 31 December 2030, as opposed to 31 December 2026 proposed by the European Commission."
"Unfortunately, this amendment did not receive the required majority."
"However, support was given to the point where the steep downward trend is being reduced for the overall amount of closure aid granted by a Member State."
"Furthermore, the operation of the production units concerned will form part of a permanent closure plan with a deadline which ought to have been set for 31 December 2020, as 2020 is the year which features in the context of the carbon capture, transport and storage projects currently being developed in several Member States."
"The deadline which resulted from the majority vote was 31 December 2018."
"I wish to point out that this deadline obtained for subsidy operations is nevertheless an achievement by the European Parliament, extending the initial deadline of 2014 as proposed by the European Commission by four years."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report on State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines."
"Coal has been exempted from State aid rules for a total of 35 years."
"The Commission has proposed an end to this exemption, which would allow State aid only to coal mines that are slated for closure by 2014."
"Any coal mine that does not close by that date must pay back State aid and all countries giving State aid must provide a climate change mitigation plan."
"Germany plans to close uncompetitive mines by 2018 and the rapporteur has proposed an amendment to extend the proposal to 2018."
"It seemed to me reasonable to support his proposal."
"I voted in favour of this report because, although it concerns important environmental issues such as energy sources and climate change and economic issues such as the durability of uncompetitive production units in the economy, at a time of economic and social crisis, it is important to stand up for the social issues."
"Measures should not be taken if they exacerbate the crisis."
"The response to the crisis is through investment and protecting the public, which in this case means ensuring conditions that allow for the closure of these mines over a period of time after the expected resolution of the crisis, thereby protecting jobs and combating unemployment."
"The aid provided for in this report is vital for helping to support those who will potentially lose their jobs in this industry."
"Retraining needs to be arranged straight away for workers affected by the mine closures, and all possible avenues of funding from regional, national and EU funds should be explored."
"In the long term, the funding of measures aimed at protecting the environment and the costs arising from the mine closures should be continued after 2014."
"Early termination of subsidies to the coal industry by the Member States could cause huge environmental and financial problems in the affected regions, and could become even more costly than a gradual phasing out of these subsidies."
"It is essential that we continue to support the coal industry in Europe to allow uncompetitive mines to be closed down gradually."
"However, the Commission's proposal does not go far enough."
"Mining is concentrated in only a few regions which will have to completely restructure their economies over the next few years."
"We have seen often enough in the past that mining regions which have become uncompetitive have suffered a severe social and economic decline within a short period of time."
"Previously, many of these regions were the 'black pearls' of economic performance in Europe."
"If we give them the time to adjust to the change in circumstances, they can continue to be economic powerhouses."
"However, if we leave them in the lurch, we will incur considerable costs as a result of unemployment and bankruptcies."
"The argument put forward by the Greens that this process is harmful to the environment is pure invention."
"Domestic coal is much more environmentally friendly than imported coal."
"For this reason, I have voted in favour of this report, which is very clearly worded."
"I voted for this report because the measures it contains will help, if they are approved by the Council, to avoid serious social repercussions in many of the European Union's Member States."
"The deadline proposed by the European Commission is too close and unrealistic."
"This is why the subsidies for hard coal production had to be extended until 2018."
"Romania, the Member State which I come from, has experience of such a huge social challenge and I believe that the extension of the deadline is a necessary and welcome step."
"I am delighted with the position adopted today by the European Parliament on State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive mines."
"It should be noted that the State aid granted in such cases must be of an exceptional nature, and there should be compliance with the regulations, which, in reality, make it possible for mines not to be closed as a result of the aid, and do not explicitly require that public aid be returned if the mines are not closed."
"We cannot end up with a situation in which funds from the state budget are used by mines to achieve profitability."
"Today, we have proposed a mechanism to force Member States to implement consistent limits on public aid, as well as a gradual transition to the general provisions that apply to all sectors of the economy."
"I voted in favour of Mr Rapkay's report because I agree with extending the deadline to 2018."
"The 2014 deadline proposed by the Commission is not justified, even by the Commission impact assessment."
"On the basis of the Commission impact assessment, and as a logical follow-on to Regulation (EC) No 1407/2002, the 2018 deadline is an appropriate one, ensuring a socially acceptable solution without entailing mass redundancies in a number of Member States."
"In these times of crisis, I do not believe that pits should be closed and thousands of workers made redundant across Europe."
"What is more, the pollution problem should not be tackled as part of this issue."
"Indeed, closing these coal mines would not solve the problem, because instead of coal coming from them, it would be imported from abroad."
"If we want to find a solution to prevent climate change, we must find it in plants that use coal."
"Only by converting those types of plants will emissions be reduced."
"I am grateful to Mr Rapkay for his excellent work, and I support the amendments tabled."
"I voted in favour, as I approve of the measures required to prevent the extremely serious socio-economic impact of pit closures, particularly in thinly populated regions."
"Given that indigenous energy sources in the Union are rare, support for the coal mining industry is justified under the Union's policy to encourage renewable and lower carbon fossil fuels for power generation."
"I therefore support the efforts made, which are in line with the broader 20-20-20 strategy."
"Based on the opinion of the European Parliament on the proposal for a regulation, the deadline for subsidising coal production is being extended to 31 December 2018 (four years longer than in the Commission's proposal) and is intended only for hard coal."
"The coal sector provides approximately 100 000 jobs."
"Mines whose operation is dependent on aid are located particularly in the Ruhr region of Germany, north-west Spain and in Valea Jiului in Romania."
"Roughly 40% of Romania's electricity production is based on coal, most of which is hard coal."
"The deadline of 2014 (proposed by the Commission) for the mine closure plan is arbitrary and is not justified based on the impact assessment carried out by the EU executive itself."
"Consequently, 2018 guarantees an acceptable solution, taking into account this impact assessment."
"The rapporteur favours a gradual reduction in aid."
"The annual reduction must not be less than 10% of the aid granted in the first year and based only on a very closely monitored closure plan."
"I voted for this report as the application of the regulation in the form proposed by the European Parliament will mitigate the adverse social repercussions of such mine closures, with the mines in Valea Jiului also among those affected by this measure."
"I voted in favour of this report because, although it concerns important environmental issues such as energy sources and climate change and economic issues such as the durability of uncompetitive production units in the economy, at a time of economic and social crisis, it is important to stand up for the social issues."
"Measures should not be taken if they exacerbate the crisis."
"The response to the crisis is through investment and protecting the public, which in this case means ensuring conditions that allow the closure of these mines over a period of time after the expected resolution of the crisis, thereby protecting jobs and combating unemployment."
"Council Regulation (EC) No 1407/2002 of 23 July 2002 on State aid for the coal industry expires on 31 December 2010."
"This would force some Member States to close their coal mines on that date and face the considerable social and regional impact of these simultaneous closures."
"The Commission's proposal suggested providing the Member States with a legal framework to allow them to extend the support given until 31 December 2014, Parliament having extended this deadline until 31 December 2018, thus ensuring the conditions for resolving this problem in a sustainable manner at a social and environmental level."
"Ending aid for the closure of uncompetitive coal mines in 2014 - the date proposed by the Commission - would have serious socio-economic consequences in certain regions of the EU where mining continues to be a significant source of employment."
"This is why Parliament's position asking for it to be delayed to 2018 is so important."
"My vote reflects my conviction that the closure of these mines should be postponed in order to give the regions and Member States concerned - mainly Spain, Germany and Romania - the time they need to carry out the required restructuring in the current period of crisis."
"That restructuring must involve, on the one hand, a transition towards sustainable economic activities that create high quality jobs, and on the other, wherever possible, establishing more competitive and sustainable coal mining and less polluting coal use."
"In order to do this, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy must support research and innovation in areas such as CO2 capture and storage and achieving more environmentally friendly combustion methods."
"Should the European Union continue to subsidise industrial sectors that are destined eventually to disappear from Europe?"
"That is the difficult question we had to answer with the adoption of the Rapkay report on State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines."
"The European Commission has proposed a scheduled end of subsidies in October 2014."
"This is a sensible proposal that takes into account the negative environmental impact of aid for the coal industry and of the need for the Member States to provide a plan of appropriate measures, for example, in the field of energy efficiency, renewable energy or carbon capture and storage."
"The facts are damning: EUR 1 288 million of aid to production, making a total of EUR 2.9 billion of subsidies for the coal industry between 2003 and 2008, has done nothing to limit the loss of market share, nor has it ensured that the industry's 100 000 workers receive useful support to help them retrain."
"I therefore regret that the European Union has not had the courage this lunchtime to say 'no' to extending aid for coal mines until the end of 2018 or to turn resolutely towards new energy sources, which would provide jobs for the European population."
"in writing. - Today's vote is in conflict with the EU's economic, energy and climate change interests."
"Subsidising uncompetitive coal mines is a waste of billions of euro of public money, particularly in the context of current pressures on public finances."
"Prolonging operational aid to coal mines fails to address the legitimate concerns of coal workers for their futures."
"Instead, it risks delaying the transition towards a green economy - with a future energy sector based on energy efficiency and renewable energy - which will ensure the creation of thousands of new, sustainable jobs in former coal producing regions."
"Although the coal mining industry does not have a great bearing on the Lithuanian economy, this report is important for my country."
"With the expiry of Regulation (EC) No 1407/2002, some Member States will be forced to close their coal mines immediately and face huge social and regional consequences related to the closures."
"Lithuania knows only too well the kind of problems that have to be faced following such closures."
"The closure of Lithuania's Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant led to the loss of business and jobs."
"It also dealt a blow to our independence in the field of energy, and so we must not forget that the European Union is founded on energy solidarity."
"At present, Lithuania and the Baltic countries are energy islands, separated from Europe's gas and the electricity networks."
"I was delighted to hear reports this month that the European Commission supports the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan."
"I hope that projects such as those related to the Visaginas Nuclear Power Plant and the Lithuania-Poland gas network interconnection will receive financial assistance from the EU."
"That would benefit the whole of Europe."
"Finally, it is important for us to bear in mind the safety of coal miners and workers in other branches of the energy industry."
"The recent accidents in Chile and New Zealand will not allow us to forget this."
"Coal mining in Europe is not efficient, and has to be subsidised."
"However, so-called alternative energy sources are equally - if not more - inefficient."
"Power plants burning coal therefore have one thing in common with solar or wind-powered plants."
"The power they produce is simply too expensive."
"States therefore subsidise coal mining, or purchase the electricity produced at a higher price than the price paid by the end user."
"Every method of producing electricity has its pluses and minuses."
"However, experience has taught us that it is not good to rely on one source of energy."
"If the energy security of Europe is a priority for us, then it would be a mistake to abandon one of the possible energy sources."
"The state should not use taxpayers' money to support non-functioning enterprises."
"Not all mines that are currently unable to survive on the market without subsidies are inevitably doomed to fail."
"Some of them may become competitive if they are given time to transform."
"The report of Mr Rapkay wants to make this possible for them."
"I come from the Prievidza region, which has a strong mining tradition."
"I know how many families would fall into poverty if the fathers lost a job in the mines."
"On their behalf, too, I have voted in favour of the report, which creates an opportunity to save thousands of jobs in a traditional Slovak mining region."
"I voted in favour of the report on the work of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) in 2009 as I believe that it is vital that it continues to play a monitoring role in negotiations on economic partnership agreements (EPAs) and fosters interaction between parliamentarians, with the aim of bringing about greater transparency for all the processes."
"In view of this, I believe that it is crucial to strengthen the parliamentary dimension of cooperation work, recognising that the establishment of the African Union and the growing power of the JPA are, without doubt, a challenge to ACP-EU cooperation and, consequently, to the ACP-EU JPA."
"Given that in 2009, the Commission and the ACP states put forward proposals for a second revision of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, it is vital that the JPA oversees events so as to ensure that it can survive and make progress as an institution."
"This cooperation between Parliament and the JPA began in 2007, and last year resulted in the creation of a fully-fledged delegation for relations with the JPA."
"I voted for this resolution which assesses the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly of the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of states (ACP) and the EU in 2009."
"The work of this assembly is particularly important, strengthening democratic processes in these countries, and therefore I agree with the observations made in the resolution that we need to closely involve parliaments in the democratic process and in the national development strategies."
"I believe that the revision of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement will help address the new changes that have come about in the decade since this agreement was first signed and will increase participation on the part of national parliaments, civil society and the private sector in those countries' political and economic life."
"I also agree with the proposal that the European Development Fund should be incorporated into the EU budget in order to increase the consistency, transparency and effectiveness of development cooperation policy and guarantee appropriate scrutiny."
"in writing. - I support this report on the work of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)-EU Parliamentary Assembly."
"The Trade Commissioner's positive response to the request by ACP countries for a review of contentious elements of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations is welcome."
"Future EPA negotiations, as well as eventual implementation, should be the subject of closer parliamentary scrutiny."
"The parliaments of ACP countries should press for their involvement in the adoption and execution of the country and regional strategy papers, as these are the main programming tools for development assistance."
"In order to help address the Parliamentary Assembly's concerns regarding the repercussions of the current crisis on the developing world, we need to work on additional sources of financing, especially an international financial transactions tax."
"The ACP governments, on the other hand, need to show an increased commitment to fighting against tax havens, tax evasion and illicit capital flight."
"The establishment, at the beginning of the current term, of a permanent European Parliament delegation for relations with the Pan-African Parliament is a very positive step which will contribute to consolidate the increasingly political engagement of the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly."
"I welcome the adoption of this report because the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) has succeeded, through the quality of its work, in establishing itself as a key player in North-South cooperation."
"For example, the assembly has played, and continues to play, a key role in monitoring the negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)."
"Furthermore, some important amendments have been passed, such as the one encouraging the JPA to explore additional and innovative sources of financing for development, such as an international financial transaction tax, and further calling on it to address the question of the eradication of tax havens."
"I voted for the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2009, because I believe that this assembly continues to provide an important framework for an open, democratic and in-depth dialogue between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of states."
"In order for the cooperation process to be more efficient and democratic, there is a need for greater involvement by the parliaments of the ACP countries in drawing up and drafting strategic cooperation plans, and for them to participate more actively in negotiating economic partnership agreements alongside the European authorities."
"Without calling into question the importance of the work done by the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) in 2009 or its undeniable contribution to development cooperation, I cannot fail to express my concern about the content of point 6 of the Joly report: 'encourages the JPA to continue to work on this area and to explore additional and innovative sources of financing for development, such as an international financial transaction tax'."
"I do not believe that an international financial transaction tax would be of much benefit to the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of states."
"The Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) convened twice in 2009, the year in which the Commission and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of states made proposals for the second revision of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement to be negotiated during 2010."
"In view of the regionalisation of the ACP group being brought about by the economic partnership agreement (EPA) process, it is important for the JPA to monitor developments extremely closely in order to ensure that it can survive and move forwards as an institution."
"I would like to highlight the JPA's concern at the repercussions of the current financial crisis, the adoption in Luanda of a resolution on the impact of the financial crisis on the ACP states, and the resolutions on its impact and on addressing the crisis in the ACP states."
"For the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly to properly carry out its role - mentioned by the rapporteur - in North-South cooperation and the strengthening of the parliamentary aspect of this cooperation, some of its fundamental characteristics need to be defended."
"The breadth of its representation is both its greatest asset and an essential requirement if it is to properly carry out its role."
"Therefore, any attempt to reduce this representativeness on the grounds of cost cutting must be rejected, while defending the assembly's plural nature, without which some of its principles would be seriously distorted and some of its basic objectives seriously compromised."
"All the means needed to achieve the effective extended participation of all parliamentarians must be guaranteed, whether they represent the EU or, in particular, the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of states."
"It is therefore with concern that we have repeatedly witnessed the failure to ensure the conditions necessary to achieve this participation, specifically with regard to interpretation services."
"Official languages of EU and ACP countries are frequently dropped, as has been the case with Portuguese on more than one occasion."
"This is a serious error, the correction of which is important."
"As a member of the ACP-EU (African, Caribbean and Pacific-European Union) Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I voted resolutely in favour of this report on the work carried out by the assembly in 2009."
"The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly is a unique institution that has succeeded in establishing itself as a key player in European-African relations and in North-South relations."
"It has succeeded in demonstrating the high quality of its work, which is based on the principles of cooperation, consultation, transparency and democratic dialogue, and on ever greater interaction between European and ACP parliamentarians."
"As the 20th session of this assembly begins in Kinshasa, I would like to encourage the JPA to continue its work and this cooperation."
"In particular, I did, of course, vote for the paragraph calling for efforts to establish an international financial transaction tax and to eradicate tax havens."
"I endorsed the Joly report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2009."
"The question we should analyse in more detail concerns the JPA regional meetings."
"There is no doubt that these meetings are necessary."
"I think, however, that we should elaborate and clarify the formula for these meetings."
"We should specify more clearly the working methods to be employed during regional meetings."
"The value of these meetings stems from the fact that they allow greater concentration on regional problems."
"Better specification of formal procedures will strengthen the opportunities for ACP-EU JPA regional meetings to be influential."
"This is precisely why we should deal with this matter. Thank you very much."
"in writing. - The group which I am part of in the European Parliament has amended the original report quite substantially."
"It now calls on the ACP governments to include stronger clauses on non-discrimination and help fight against tax evasion and tax havens."
"Greater involvement of the ACP national parliaments and civil society - through financial and technical support - is needed in order to enhance the ACP-EU cooperation."
"I voted to approve the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2009, because I consider its contribution to North-South cooperation to be fundamental."
"In fact, the JPA has played, and continues to play, a key role in involving local authorities and bodies in the negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements."
"For these reasons, I join in the calls made by my fellow Members for the Commission to make every effort to provide timely information on the negotiations, in order to ensure that Parliament can participate fully in monitoring the agreements and to assist it in doing so."
"Lastly, I consider it vital for the European Parliament to play an informed role - and I say this not only with reference to the negotiations in this area - since it is an institution capable of ensuring the transparency of the process and of voicing the needs of local communities."
"in writing. - I voted for this report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2009."
"The strengthening of parliamentary oversight is vital to ensure that EU development funds are put to best use and contribute effectively to achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"The assembly has played, and continues to play, a key role in monitoring the negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), allowing MEPs to hear first hand the concerns of the ACP parliamentarians and thus contributing to greater European Parliament oversight of the Commission's negotiations and implementation of EPAs."
"The African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of states-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) convened twice in 2009, and came to important decisions on various matters at these meetings, particularly the food and financial crisis, the situation in Somalia, climate change and the situation in Madagascar."
"Several working groups also met to debate a range of relevant topics, including: training for better governance, construction projects and urban re-housing, disabled people, rural tourism and minority rights in the Czech Republic."
"These regular meetings have become important due to their diversity and the discussion of important issues for both parties, with the aim of trying to come up with solutions for the problems faced by the most disadvantaged regions."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Joly's excellent report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which is - I repeat - a unique institution in the world by virtue of its composition and its willingness to work together to promote North-South interdependence, not only by legislative means, but also through democratic dialogue and cooperation."
"I should like to take advantage of this report to make the case for a tax on international financial transactions in order to help certain donors to honour their commitments in terms of official development aid and to help developing countries to make the changes necessary to cope with climate change."
"I would emphasise that the Monterrey Consensus in 2002, the follow-up to the Doha conference in 2008 and the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals held in New York in September 2010 issued a favourable opinion on innovative and alternative sources of financing for development and stressed the need for a balanced approach between the economic, social and environmental aspects of development."
"I have voted against the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2009, because it is very vague and its wording is imprecise."
"In addition, it does not contain any plans for more efficient development cooperation with the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of states (ACP) in future."
"Development aid, in its current form, is a failure in 80% of cases."
"It has simply increased the dependency of the states in question on external aid."
"We need to help these states to help themselves."
"It must be possible for them gradually to develop a functioning national economy."
"The ability to feed themselves plays a major role in this context."
"However, this report doggedly supports the status quo, which is why I have voted against it."
"Cooperation with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries is one of the most important aspects of the European Union's foreign policy."
"I am therefore sorry to learn of the financial problems affecting the ACP Group."
"Regardless of these problems, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly is one of the most important fora today for North-South dialogue."
"I welcome the development of regional integration between African countries, on the one hand, and Caribbean countries, on the other, which facilitates effective dialogue between the European Parliament and the global South."
"In view of these aspects, and fully supporting the development of dialogue between the EU and the countries of the South, I decided to vote in favour of the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2009."
"I voted in favour of the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, because I believe that the assembly has played a key role and has endeavoured to find solutions to what are, at times, complicated problems."
"Although its role is that of an advisory body, it is an important forum and a meeting point for discussing and attempting to meet the various demands."
"Of all the important reports and resolutions adopted, one need only mention those on the situation in Madagascar, on climate change, on the situation in Niger and on the second revision of the Cotonou Agreement."
"Worthy of note, lastly, is the resolution on the consequences of the financial crisis on ACP countries, in which it is pointed out that those countries, although in no way responsible for the global turmoil, have unfortunately ended up paying the highest price, in terms of increased costs, reduced aid from rich countries, and more expensive commodities."
"I voted for the report on the work of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of states-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) in 2009."
"It is important to highlight the role of the JPA, as it has succeeded in establishing itself as a key player in North-South cooperation, contributing to strengthening open and democratic dialogue between the EU and the ACP group of states."
"We have voted today, in plenary, on a motion for a resolution on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2009."
"The Joint Parliamentary Assembly met twice in 2009."
"On these occasions, 10 resolutions and the Luanda Declaration on the second revision of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement were approved."
"During the year, two regional meetings were also held, in Guyana (Caribbean region) and in Burkina Faso (West African region) respectively."
"Despite this, 2009 was blighted by the decision, adopted by the ACP Council of Ministers in December 2008, to make radical cuts to the ACP secretariat budget earmarked for staff missions."
"This decision considerably affected the possibility of guaranteeing services relating to JPA meetings held at sites other than Brussels."
"In December 2009, the ACP Council adopted the necessary revisions to guarantee that the budget funding for 2010 was sufficient to cover two plenary sessions, one regional meeting and two additional missions at most."
"Given the context, it is appropriate to continue to work within this sector and examine additional and innovative sources of development finance, namely, a tax on international financial transactions."
"in writing. - I applaud this resolution, led by our colleague, Eva Joly, where it states that it welcomes the fact that in 2009, the JPA continued to provide a framework for an open, democratic and in-depth dialogue between the European Union and the ACP countries and calls for an enhanced political dialogue, welcomes the new Commissioner for Trade's positive response to the request by several ACP countries and regions for a review of the contentious issues raised during negotiations on the EPA, in line with the statements made by the President of the Commission, and underlines the need for close parliamentary monitoring of the negotiations and implementation of the EPA."
"As a member of the Delegation to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I endorsed the report on the work of the JPA in 2009."
"I have a good opinion of the work of the assembly this year, including, in particular, the resolutions adopted on the effect of the global crisis on social conditions and concerning climate change."
"Next week, during the 20th session of the assembly, we will be dealing, amongst other matters, with achievement of the Millennium Development Goals."
"As a member of the JPA Committee on Social Affairs and the Environment, I think it is essential that a comprehensive analysis be made and a wide-ranging debate entered into next year on the environmental and social situation in the ACP states."
"A review of existing measures will allow us to plan objectives for the coming years more effectively."
"In keeping with the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee, I am also in favour of greater support and recognition for the African social economy."
"Integration of the African social economy into the EU programme can result in a strengthening of cooperation with international organisations such as the International Labour Organisation and the World Bank, and can also lead to greater support from European public opinion for strengthening EU external aid by greater involvement of the major players of the European social economy."
"I think the JPA could also examine more thoroughly the role of the African social economy in eliminating poverty."
"I hope the JPA will be actively involved in implementation of the EU-Africa strategy."
"I voted in favour of this report, which reviews the work done with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states."
"With this text, the European Parliament is drawing attention to the fact that the success of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is linked to an open, democratic and in-depth dialogue between the European Union and the ACP countries."
"The report also reiterates the principle of the universality of human rights and reminds the Council that the European Parliament has made repeated calls to include a stronger clause on non-discrimination in the revision of the Cotonou Agreement."
"I particularly welcome the vote on an amendment calling for a financial transaction tax as a possible response to the crisis, even though I am under no illusions about the European Parliament's contradictory votes on this issue."
"With this amendment, the European Parliament is calling for additional and innovative sources of financing for development, such as an international financial transaction tax, to be explored, and 'further calls on the JPA to address the question of the eradication of tax havens'."
"Let us hope that this report will not go completely unheeded and that all the European institutions will be able to refer to it in order to forge other relationships with the ACP countries."
"I am approving this report, highlighting Article 67, regarding the various legal systems and practices, and access to justice, issues on which mutual recognition should contribute to better knowledge of the various legal systems and practices."
"I believe that enormous progress has already been made in terms of civil justice in the EU, and that this ambitious plan for the adoption of an approach to civil law that is more strategic and less fragmented should reflect the real needs of citizens and businesses."
"It must also take into account the difficulties of legislating in an area of shared jurisdiction, with harmonisation an option where there are overlaps."
"Therefore, dedication to the various legal approaches and constitutional traditions of the various Member States must be maintained while, at the same time, an EU-level approach must be thought up in order to resolve general problems."
"Mention must be made of the need to ensure that measures that have already been put into practice work and progress already made needs to be consolidated, so that we can move forward coherently towards a correct and functional implementation of the Stockholm Programme."
"The Stockholm Programme establishes ambitious European policies on justice and security in order to build a citizens' Europe."
"The objectives include a legislative proposal on reinforced cooperation with regard to the law applicable to divorce."
"In Europe, 20% of divorces concern international couples."
"Such divorces are sometimes marred by endless red tape and a lack of clear responses from national systems."
"In many cases, the children and the weakest spouse suffer most from the emotional stresses and strains arising from legal action."
"Where possible, the best solution would be to set up a system of mediation, namely an amicable agreement between the parties."
"It would be appropriate to refer for this purpose to the concepts defined in Directive 2008/52/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters and the European code of conduct for mediators."
"It will also be important for all citizens to gain access to up-to-date, high quality information now available in a Commission database on essential aspects of national and EU law and procedures concerned not only with separation and divorce but also mediation."
"The Stockholm Programme seeks to create a European area of freedom, security and justice that will guarantee citizens' fundamental rights, including freedom of enterprise, so as to develop entrepreneurship in all economic sectors."
"Since the Union first obtained competence for justice and home affairs, and the subsequent creation of the area of freedom, security and justice, huge progress has been made in the area of civil justice and harmonisation of the rules of private international law has advanced apace."
"This is very important as this area of law is the means par excellence of achieving mutual recognition of, and respect for, each others' legal systems."
"I feel that the action plan presented by the European Commission is ambitious but, at the same time, it is necessary to properly assess the effectiveness and compliance with set objectives of measures already imposed, in order to satisfy the needs of citizens, business and practitioners."
"I support the proposal of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection to include the text on the European single market in the resolution on civil, commercial, family and international private law."
"In my opinion, the single market helps the European area in terms of freedom, security and justice and contributes to strengthening the European model of a social market economy, but, at the same time, protects consumers."
"Bulgaria, which is on the fringes of the EU, is often under threat from the import of dangerous or potentially dangerous counterfeit goods."
"Just recently, 20 year old lamb meat was found on the Bulgarian market."
"And that is only one of many cases."
"The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice will strengthen the single market, particularly consumer rights protection, and I urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to support the Commission in taking this into account and providing legislation which will ensure the proper functioning of the single market in the interests of consumers."
"I voted for this report because the European Parliament calls on the Commission to ensure as effectively and swiftly as possible that the Stockholm Action Plan truly reflects the needs of Europe's citizens, particularly as regards free movement throughout the European Union, along with employment rights, the needs of business and equal opportunities for all."
"I would like to stress that Union law must be at the service of citizens, notably in the areas of family and civil law, and therefore I am pleased that since the Union first obtained competence for justice and home affairs and the subsequent creation of the area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ), huge progress has been made in the area of civil justice."
"It should be pointed out that the Stockholm Programme seeks to create a European area of freedom, security and justice that will guarantee citizens' fundamental rights, including freedom of enterprise, so as to develop entrepreneurship in all economic sectors."
"The time then is ripe for reflection on the future development of the AFSJ, and the European Parliament therefore calls on the Commission to initiate a wide-ranging debate involving all interested parties, including, in particular, judges and practitioners."
"The report contains a whole series of recommendations in the areas of civil, commercial and family law, as well as international private law."
"It is mainly concerned with measures designed to increase the enforceability of law in cross-border disputes and, in the spirit of the Stockholm Programme, those targeting a greater degree of cooperation between Member States' judicial authorities."
"The action plan also proposes a legislative initiative to draw up a provision to increase the effectiveness of the implementation of judgments relating to the transparency of debtors' activities, and similar provisions on the freezing of bank accounts."
"I consider the question of standardising information on personal circumstances in the documents of EU Member State citizens as a natural step, as it will eliminate barriers when travelling."
"The report also calls on the Commission, which has set up a working group for arbitration, to consult on any legislative proposals before submitting them, as arbitration issues have a significant impact on international trade."
"The measures proposed in the report will help to increase the enforceability of law in the EU and I have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"I abstained from the final vote on the Berlinguer resolution because Amendment 2 was thrown out."
"This was extremely important for ruling out possible erroneous interpretations of item 40, which states that Parliament 'strongly supports plans to enable the mutual recognition of the effects of civil status documents'."
"The expression could suggest, for example, a European Union-wide obligation to recognise a union between people of the same sex registered in a Member State where such a union is permitted."
"In actual fact, we must distinguish between the effects of a completed legal action (in the case of marriage) and the effects of an official registration document."
"The latter bears full witness to what is documented (for example, that a homosexual marriage has been entered into in Holland) and this public witness is the effect of the official marital status document."
"However, the effects of the official registration document are something different and their recognition (for example, a survivor's pension) is not permitted in a State that does not recognise them."
"Matters of family law are, in any case, part of the identity of individual states and cannot be touched by EU law."
"The possibility of a different interpretation led me to choose to abstain."
"I welcome the huge progress that has been made in the area of civil justice since the Union first obtained competence for justice and home affairs and the area of freedom, security and justice was created."
"Moreover, I would congratulate the Commission on its very ambitious plan, which responds to a substantial number of the demands that Parliament has been making."
"It is essential to adopt a more strategic and less fragmented approach based on the real needs of citizens and businesses when exercising their rights and freedoms in the single market."
"The Stockholm Action Plan must reflect these needs in respect of mobility, employment rights, the needs of business and equal opportunities, amongst other things, while promoting legal certainty and access to rapid and efficient justice."
"We cannot ignore the difficulties of legislating in an area of shared competence where harmonisation is only infrequently an option and overlapping needs to be avoided."
"Divergences between the legal approaches and constitutional traditions of the various legal systems can serve as a source of inspiration for a European legal culture, but should not constitute a barrier to the further development of European law."
"To this day, there are certain differences in the civil law of the 27 Member States and of those set to join the EU in the near future."
"The action plan presented is a step forward; it notes the similarities and highlights the differences so as to draw attention to the need to reduce those differences."
"In particular, as regards the subjects covered by the committees of which I am a member, I believe that the creation of common rules and the implementation of an integrated judicial system are essential for guaranteeing the survival of the single market."
"While everyone's legal traditions and specific characteristics should be respected, today's challenges require, in fact, a common effort to harmonise European laws."
"I therefore welcome the report, which calls on the European Commission to strive to remove the legal barriers to the exercise of rights in the Member States and to lessen the negative impact of those barriers on citizens involved in cross-border legal matters, both of which are essential conditions for the establishment of a 'European judicial culture', which alone can guarantee the creation of a common area of freedom, security and justice in Europe."
"Explanation of vote: on 23 November 2010, the Swedish Conservatives voted in favour of the report on civil law, commercial law, family law and private international law aspects of the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme."
"However, we would like to emphasise that we believe a great deal of care should be taken with regard to the harmonisation of the different forms of training for the legal professions in the Member States and stress that such harmonisation does not fall within the framework of the Stockholm Programme."
"We also do not believe that knowledge of two languages should be a requirement to be able to practice as a lawyer."
"Finally, we would like to point out that party autonomy is of the utmost importance in commercial contract law and it should also remain so."
"The Stockholm Programme is an essential next step in the development of the European area of freedom, security and justice towards a greater focus on individuals."
"A greater focus that contributes not only to a more comprehensive perspective on citizenship, including respect for human beings and human dignity, but also to a perspective on the law and on justice that makes it accessible throughout the Union, so that individuals can exert their rights without any internal borders."
"A focus on individuals that must be guaranteed across the board, including as regards the growing phenomenon of immigration and asylum, albeit in strict compliance with the rules on civil harmony, including security."
"The Commission Action Plan is a consistent embodiment of the Stockholm Programme."
"When developing European areas of freedom, security and justice, however, respect must always be shown for the principle of subsidiarity, which encourages respect for individuals and for the traditions that form an integral part of their history."
"The report on civil law, commercial law, family law and private international law aspects of the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme, on which we have voted, seems to me to be along these lines."
"I voted for this report as I think that it is of paramount importance to implement properly the measures envisaged by the Stockholm Programme with regard to improving the area of freedom security and justice."
"This can be achieved by improving judicial cooperation between Member States, promoting a European judicial culture and by resolving the various incompatibility issues between the different procedural law models which exist at Member State level."
"The Commission's Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme must take into account all these aspects mentioned in the report."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted for this report because it advocates specific measures promoting legal certainty and access to rapid and efficient justice."
"Under the Stockholm Action Plan, it is necessary to ensure that the exchange of best practices between legal systems pays particular attention to the needs of individual citizens and businesses, facilitating mobility within the EU, employment rights and equal opportunities."
"The areas of civil law, commercial law, family law and private international law constitute some of the most sensitive areas of the law applicable in each of the EU Member States."
"I therefore think that any changes to them must be made with particular care, with the utmost consideration given to the principle of subsidiarity."
"European legislators must always have respect for the various legal systems, for the consensus created around them in each of the respective political communities, and for their legitimate options; they cannot and must not ignore the fact that they are dealing with peoples and nations with stable, established and deep-rooted legal systems."
"I therefore recommend making changes suitable and proportional to people's actual needs, and stringent checks on the proposed plans and initiatives."
"While I carefully monitor the adoption of measures in this regard, I am aware that there are legal relationships that, because of their nature, are more likely to call on the laws of more than one country."
"I acknowledge that much of what is advocated is positive and aims at the exchange of best practices and the realisation of a true area of freedom, security and justice."
"The Stockholm Programme, adopted by the Council in December 2009, establishes priorities for the development of a European area of freedom, security and justice over the next five years."
"Union law facilitates mobility and enables the public to exercise their right to free movement, thus strengthening confidence in the European judicial area."
"The Commission's Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme involves making use of the tools available following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to ease daily life and business for EU citizens, reconciling the needs of the public and the internal market with the diversity of legal traditions among the Member States."
"I support this report, but would note that certain areas should take priority, such as civil matters and the mutual recognition of official documents."
"This own-initiative report tackles various complex subjects based on aspects of civil law, commercial law, family law and private international law in the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme."
"As a result of this, our opinions about the rapporteur's suggestions are also diverse."
"Some of them seem positive to us, specifically when he refers to the need to foster debate about the problems relating to maritime, commercial and family law."
"It is just that in Portugal, there is also an unresolved issue, which is the specialisation of magistrates for those areas."
"Naturally, because of the type of issues in question, magistrates need specific training to work in family courts."
"There are several problems in the commercial areas, however, and it would probably be more important to ensure trademark protection by recourse to civil jurisdiction rather than criminal."
"In this area in Portugal too, the delays are very long and it is acknowledged that many magistrates find it difficult to reach a decision on very specific subjects."
"Explanation of vote: on 23 November 2010, the Swedish Conservatives voted in favour of the report on civil law, commercial law, family law and private international law aspects of the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme."
"However, we would like to emphasise that we believe a great deal of care should be taken with regard to the harmonisation of the different forms of training for the legal professions in the Member States and stress that such harmonisation does not fall within the framework of the Stockholm Programme."
"We also do not believe that knowledge of two languages should be a requirement to be able to practice as a lawyer."
"Finally, we would like to point out that party autonomy is of the utmost importance in commercial contract law and it should also remain so."
"We voted against this report."
"It is unacceptable to create a 28th regime, even if it is optional, in certain areas of civil law, in order to bypass national systems."
"Moreover, it is the height of hypocrisy to state that the diversity of these systems is an asset when 'regulatory emulation' is also recommended to allow for their convergence - or, in other words, their eventual standardisation."
"It is unacceptable, above all, for the free movement of persons and non-discriminatory access to the social security benefits of countries of residence to be used as a pretext for demanding mutual recognition of civil status documents, because the real aim behind this proposal is not to make life easier for European families who have moved to another EU country."
"The real aim is to impose same-sex marriage and adoption by homosexual couples on those Member States that do not recognise them in their own law."
"Family law is strictly and exclusively the responsibility of the Member States, and it must remain so."
"However, we must put a stop to the unilateral decisions of the German judiciary with regard to child custody when couples of mixed nationality divorce, and to the excessive, absolute power of the Jugendamt, which has been denounced in petitions submitted to us."
"I am pleased at the adoption of this report, which welcomes the Stockholm Action Plan and, more specifically, the elements it contains in relation to civil law, commercial law, family law and private international law."
"The European Union is working to create a 'European judicial area', and that area is based on the idea that judgments, like people, must be able to 'move' within the Union, in order to help European citizens gain access to justice."
"This 'common judicial area' involves the principle of mutual recognition of judgments by Member States, and this issue of mutual recognition is crucial in areas such as family law, contracts, succession and wills, matrimonial property, and so on."
"These are crucial areas in everyone's lives."
"Our report insists, among other things, on the importance of judicial training, legal education, the creation of networks between judges and the introduction of exchange programmes."
"I fully support these objectives."
"I have voted in favour of the amendments and against the Berlinguer report, because I am not sure that it provides adequate support for subsidiarity."
"I do not believe that we should be able to delete important details just because this is a large package of directives."
"This is a strategy which will backfire."
"For me, the crux of the matter is paragraph 40, which, in the form that it was adopted today, together with other components of the Stockholm Programme, will provoke conflicts of jurisdiction."
"In specific terms, there are doubts as to whether we should use family law for the mutual recognition of civil status documents, in other words, marriage certificates, and, therefore, whether we should take into account the decision-making authority of the Member States with regard to the definition of marriage, following the procedure outlined in Article 81(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"While this remains unclear, there is a risk of a conflict between the simple procedures of civil law and the complex procedures of cross-border family law."
"A sentence corresponding with Amendment 3 would have been sufficient to defuse this conflict."
"This is a detail which, unfortunately, was not supported by the majority in Parliament today."
"I remain of the opinion that marriage and family life are under the specific protection of the state. They are exclusively a matter for the Member States."
"Therefore, I have voted against this own-initiative report."
"in writing. - This resolution calls on the Commission and the Council to ensure that Parliament is fully consulted on the organisation and arrangement of judicial training."
"This initiative will aid the concept of a European judicial culture so that the entire citizenry of the EU will be treated fairly and with dignity."
"I voted in favour of the report on the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme because I consider the progress made in relation to the area of freedom, security and justice to be crucial."
"Since its creation, in fact, huge progress has been made in the area of justice, including civil justice."
"I believe that the different legal approaches and constitutional traditions of the Member States must be respected, but I also believe that the existence of such differences should be considered a strong point on which to focus in order to achieve the aim of developing European law further."
"In this respect, the European judicial community must be involved, since its contribution should strengthen the idea of a real European judicial culture, through the sharing of knowledge and the study of comparative law."
"I therefore fully support the proposal to create a forum in which judges who frequently deal with cross-border issues, such as admiralty, commercial, family and personal injury cases, could hold discussions and expand their knowledge."
"Lastly, I believe that, on the basis of these preconditions, the Stockholm Action Plan should be focused on fully satisfying the demand for European justice voiced by individual citizens and individual businesses when exercising their rights and freedoms."
"The Stockholm Programme (2010-2015), when viewed from the perspective of cooperation within the area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ), in reality lays the future foundations of European supremacy in many areas with the aim of removing any remaining obstacles to 'free movement' between the EU Member States."
"Whether it be fundamental rights, privacy, minority rights, 'European Union citizenship' or asylum and immigration policy, this confused assortment in fact serves as a pretext for encouraging the federalist ambition of a European bureaucratic superstate."
"I maintain that the law and all habits and customs are a fundamental part of the spirit and identity of a people and a sovereign nation."
"To support the idea of obscure European harmonisation, particularly in relation to civil and family law, would be tantamount to denying the sacrifices made and the ground won over the centuries."
"Since, for the time being, it still enjoys some of the highest legal and social protection standards in the world, France will not benefit from any progress made by remaining the victim of pro-European, globalist and ultraliberal stubbornness."
"in writing. - I welcome the adoption of this report on the Stockholm Programme, which stresses the need to ensure mutual recognition of official documents issued by national administrations."
"This will include same-sex unions, meaning that partners in same-sex unions can act as next of kin in case of accidents abroad and, where appropriate, have equal rights to tax benefits while living or working in another Member State."
"The aims of the Stockholm Programme and its implementation plan are positive."
"In my opinion, one of the main reasons is the fact that the aim of the programme is to create a foundation and conditions under which EU citizens can make full use of, and enforce, their rights and freedoms."
"The implementation of the Stockholm Programme has, and will continue to have, its difficulties."
"On the one hand, there is the objective need to unify legislation (for example, in the area of the right to freedom of movement), and, on the other, there is the danger of abuse through differing interpretations of the unified legal norms."
"The initiative of the Stockholm Programme aimed at securing recognition of official documents by Member States can be welcomed."
"However, this mechanism must not come into direct conflict with the basic regulations of Member States, particularly in the area of family law."
"In view of the fact that family law reflects a tradition going back many years and a hard-won social consensus, it is not acceptable for Member State sovereignty in this area to be breached, albeit by well-intentioned unification schemes."
"Further development should be aimed at ensuring that the unified law does not lead to reduced standards in terms of the rights (civil, social, etc.) that exist in Member States at various levels."
"It is also necessary to ensure that the unification of regulations does not lead to the possibility of launching property claims and violating state integrity, and there must be a clear definition as to how and by whom the enforceability of unified European regulations will be ensured."
"The areas of civil law, commercial law, family law and private international law constitute some of the most sensitive areas of the law applicable in the different EU Member States."
"I abstained from voting on this report as I believe it is vital that the principle of subsidiarity is always present in these matters, especially those that relate to family law and when addressing issues such as mutual recognition of matrimonial and family law."
"What do we intend to improve about the level of European judicial cooperation as we currently know it?"
"The document adopted sheds light on the most important parts of the Commission's plans."
"It underlines the tasks that lie before us in the upcoming period from the perspective of the citizens."
"As a politician and a teacher, I agree that communications between higher education institutions require further improvement, so that the new generation of jurists are already in a position to familiarise themselves with the diversity of European legal culture during their years at university."
"It is in the interest of Member States to further perfect the judicial area."
"The energy invested in education has a bearing on the effectiveness of the justice system."
"We must make efforts to ensure that the resources required for training are available everywhere."
"The main contributors to the removal of obstacles to cross-border cooperation can be those professionals who have experience gained abroad, coupled with the appropriate language skills."
"Trust in Member States' systems can be improved by learning about them."
"Students must be sensitised to participate in foreign exchange programmes."
"It is of vital importance to support fora which aim to develop professional dialogue."
"Representatives of the legal professions must be given an opportunity to continuously express their opinion regarding an area based on freedom, security and justice."
"It is they who face the relevant problems in practice."
"It is they to whom we direct our questions concerning the fruits of the measures taken so far."
"As representatives of the interests of citizens, we must strive to ensure that the EU does not conjure an image of a legislative maze in people's minds."
"Legislation on consumers and enterprises should indeed be for them and about them."
"Paragraph 40 of the report on civil law, commercial law, family law and private international law aspects of the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme represents a serious intrusion into national law, by calling for same-sex marriages and partnerships which are entered into in a specific Member State to be recognised in all other Member States."
"Clever wording is being used to smuggle this measure in through the back door."
"In the German version of the motion and, I suspect, in many other language versions, the actual aim of this paragraph is not nearly as clear as it should be."
"Since I am opposed to gay marriage out of principle and, in particular, to this deceitful style of politics, I have voted against this paragraph and against the report."
"The report could become an incentive for partnership tourism, in the same way as has already happened with adoption and artificial insemination."
"Entering into a partnership in a country where rights and claims equivalent to those of marriage have the force of law will allow the partners to make claims in their country of origin which only apply to marriage there."
"The ultimate consequence of this resolution would be to make the existence of different regulations in different countries totally absurd."
"The report deals with a topic of utmost importance, which is the way the EU meets the needs of its citizens and commercial companies in the area of the law, with particular reference to cross-border civil and commercial disputes."
"However, I regret that I did not find in the report's content any reference to the actions required to inform citizens or company administrators about the opportunities offered to them by European legislation with regard to pursuing their interests in judicial proceedings."
"Not enough is known about these opportunities and, therefore, they are not utilised enough."
"It is important to focus on magistrates and lawyers, but it does not ensure that citizens have total access to this information."
"I voted in favour of adopting the report on civil law, commercial law, family law and private international law aspects of the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme."
"Ever since the EU gained powers in the field of justice and internal affairs, and since the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice, for which the EU and the Member States are currently jointly competent, significant progress has been made in the field of civil law."
"The European Commission communication entitled 'An area of freedom, security and justice serving the citizen' proposed an ambitious plan for development of the aforesaid area in the period 2010-2014."
"There can be no doubt that further progress in this area will necessitate a more strategic approach, targeted primarily at the needs of citizens and businesses with regard to exercising rights and freedoms in the single market."
"Progressive harmonisation, approximation and standardisation are required, for example, in the field of consumer protection."
"It goes without saying that the radically different legal systems and traditions must be respected and reconciled when ensuring the functionality of measures that have already been introduced."
"However, I believe that their coexistence should be regarded as a strength and inspiration when creating common solutions for European legislation, rather than a hindrance."
"In order to meet the challenges, the Commission should conduct an open debate with various representatives of the judicial system, including, in particular, legal professionals."
"I voted in favour of the Berlinguer report insofar as it concerns aspects of fundamental importance for enabling a shift towards a Europe of the citizens and for promoting the development of a European judicial culture."
"In particular, the report addresses in a balanced and exhaustive way issues concerning the training of judges; cooperation between judicial authorities; European contract law; fundamental rights, including freedom of enterprise, so as to develop entrepreneurship in all economic sectors; and the mutual recognition of official documents issued by national administrations, including the effects of civil status documents."
"The Stockholm Programme aims to safeguard the fundamental rights of citizens in an area of freedom, security and justice."
"However, the differences in the various legal systems of the Member States are creating barriers to the development of European legislation."
"That is why I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution, which proposes the convergence and harmonisation of civil, commercial, family and private international law and focuses on cooperation between the various legal systems of the Member States by:"
"â¢ nurturing a common European judicial culture;"
"â¢ educating and training judges, prosecutors and other court officers, with the aim of building mutual understanding of the legal systems of the other Member States and resolving cross-border disputes;"
"â¢ creating a regular forum so that judges in areas of law where cross-border issues arise can examine areas of legal controversy or difficulty with the aim of building a climate of mutual confidence;"
"â¢ introducing a European contract law;"
"â¢ introducing cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil and commercial matters."
"The Stockholm Programme adopted in December 2009 establishes the priorities for the development of a European area of freedom, security and justice over the next five years."
"In this context, it is important to point out the significant results that have already been achieved, and to hope that the recommended measures can help to respond to the real needs of the public and businesses, facilitating their mobility and the exercise of their rights and freedoms in the single market, without jeopardising the requirements of the principle of subsidiarity and respect for diversity of the legal approaches and constitutional traditions of the different Member States."
"Today, we voted in plenary on a proposal for a resolution on positive law aspects of the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme, in other words, European Union priorities for the development of an area of freedom, security and justice in the period 2010-2014 with particular regard to aspects of civil, commercial and private international law."
"The dossier calls on the Commission to improve the proposal submitted in an attempt to overcome certain problems and critical areas that occur specifically in international judicial practice."
"Assisting national judges on technical aspects of the proposed measures during legislative drafting and the establishment of an independent European claims instrument, which would, amongst other things, make it possible to resolve, at least partly, problems raised by differences of opinion in national procedural law, are specific examples of the constructive and approving approach that a common and extensively discussed proposal for a resolution could have on European legislation."
"In an area as important to citizens as civil law, it is necessary to respect and accommodate radically different legal approaches and constitutional traditions but it is also necessary to face up to the negative legal consequences for citizens arising out of this difference."
"in writing. - This is a good regulation calling mainly for the use of every possible means to nurture a European judicial culture, particularly through legal education and training."
"I hope that the actions identified in the Action Plan will be carried forward within the planned timeframe considering their importance for improving the lives of European citizens."
"In particular, Italy has always supported the need to develop mutual trust between Member States of the Union and is in favour of continuing to extend EU regulations in the sector of justice and internal affairs."
"From this perspective, we strongly support the approach of the whole Action Plan, which hinges on the principle of mutual recognition of decisions, to be achieved by strengthening mutual trust."
"I would also emphasise the need to use all possible means to foster a European judicial culture, particularly through legal teaching and training."
"I would like to express my satisfaction over the importance attributed to matters concerning civil law, such as the legislative proposal on reinforced cooperation in the divorce law sector and the recognition and creation of official public documents on inheritance."
"I am particularly pleased to see the emphasis placed on the need to introduce specific actions and programmes to promote an effective European judicial culture, based on the supply of training measures, to be held under Erasmus schemes for judges and all legal operators."
"The actions identified in the plan are very important for improving the guarantees of European citizens in respect of the law, but it is necessary to adopt a more strategic and less fragmentary approach based on the real needs of citizens and enterprises in the exercising of their rights."
"While, on the one hand, we must consider the difficulties of legislating in a harmonised manner within an area of shared responsibility, on the other, we need to extend EU regulations in the sector of justice and internal affairs."
"In this way, the parameters of legal certainty will be increasingly clear and supported and we will pave the way for a genuinely common legal theory and practice with a European Union."
"Thanks to the Stockholm Programme, the citizens of Member States will be able to assert their rights throughout the European Union in the fields of civil, commercial and labour law."
"The programme offers advantages and greater transparency to citizens."
"It also improves the consistency of our system of legal regulations in the European Union."
"However, in order to build systems which are more uniform, it is essential that there be greater coordination of what we do and that experience be exchanged between the countries of the Union."
"This concerns, to a large degree, the justice system, including the extremely important questions of migration and the fight against organised crime."
"A very important matter, particularly during the current economic problems, will be development of effective mechanisms of action in the area of strengthening the single market and economic integration, by which I mean more liberal principles of commercial exchange between the countries of the European Union and the establishment of legislation on commercial exchange between third countries."
"From the point of view of the participants of economic processes, it is necessary, above all, to specify businesses' and consumers' rights of protection and to continue to monitor effectively the implementation and enforcement of legal regulations in the area of the single market."
"Since the European Union acquired shared competence over justice and home affairs, huge progress has been made in the area of civil justice."
"Article 67 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union establishes the importance of respecting the different legal systems and traditions within the EU and Mr Berlinguer's report highlights this as one of the strengths of the EU."
"Subsidiarity is one of the basic principles of EU law and is based on the condition that the subordinate member is able to resolve problems and carry out tasks independently."
"The areas of justice and home affairs have traditionally been the responsibility of the Member States."
"Each Member State has its own special features and traditions which reflect the cultural diversity of Europe."
"However, in order to keep pace with the changing reality in today's world, joint responsibility with the European Union is needed."
"Nowadays, treaties with cross-border implications are the rule and partnerships or families where the partners come from different Member States are commonplace."
"However, these involve challenges for national civil legislation which we will have to overcome."
"As the rapporteur recommends, it is now time to develop a European judicial culture alongside the national judicial cultures."
"It is a pity that this Parliament has decided simply to withdraw the debate on the Stockholm Programme from the agenda."
"Where there is no opportunity to debate, there is no opportunity to put questions."
"Also, if we do not allow a critical exchange of views on the integration process, it will only reinforce the concerns of many Member State citizens."
"One of these concerns is the talk about creating a civil-law statute of marriage."
"Many family associations in all Member States are pointing out that the mechanism of the Stockholm Programme may therefore be taken advantage of by same-sex couples."
"This question can be resolved not only within the framework of civil law procedures and private international law, but also through the complex procedure of family law under Article 81(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."
"If the Stockholm Programme is misused for this purpose, it would amount to an indirect change in legislation, which is precisely what the Union has long been fighting against."
"The Commission and the Council must therefore explain that neither the socio-legal mechanisms nor the Stockholm Protocol will ever lead to the creation of a statute of marriage for same-sex couples."
"If we want to build a strong Union, it must not be at the cost of restricting Member State powers or the common good."
"The ECR Group has submitted proposals for amendment which emphasise the powers of the Member States."
"Unless these proposals are adopted, I will vote against the submitted report."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Statement by the President"
"I shall start with a short announcement."
"I strongly condemn the attack by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea against the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong."
"I am deeply concerned regarding today's events on the Korean Peninsula."
"Using raw force and military power will not solve any issues and further loss of human lives must be avoided."
"In the interests of the Korean Peninsula and the wider region, the North and South should make efforts to rebuild confidence in a durable way."
"This is why I welcome the announcement by President Lee Myung-bak that the South Korean Government intends to avoid escalation of the worrying situation."
"I call on the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to immediately stop any hostile actions and to refrain from all activities that risk further escalation."
"The Korean Armistice Agreement must be fully respected by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"2011 budget (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the 2011 budget."
"I would like to begin our discussion."
"Mr Barroso, Mr Wathelet, Mr Chastel, during the conciliation meetings, the European Parliament and the Council did not manage to reach agreement on the 2011 budget."
"We regret this."
"Agreement could have been reached."
"The European Parliament is aware of the need to make savings."
"We were prepared to agree to limiting the growth of payment appropriations in the 2011 budget to 2.91% compared to 2010."
"In return, we wanted to establish a method of bringing the Treaty of Lisbon into force, and specifically we wanted to establish which procedures should be followed in further budget negotiations."
"This is important, because the Treaty of Lisbon is in force."
"We did not want to go beyond the treaty in any way."
"We know that the majority of Member States wanted this agreement."
"Now we have to decide as quickly as possible how to solve the problem that we have no budget."
"This is the responsibility of all three European institutions."
"We have said that a fast track is possible for Parliament, but only if our expectations concerning procedures for the next budget negotiations are guaranteed."
"In the last few days, we have witnessed considerable progress in terms of talks with the Council."
"I am sure that an agreement is within reach."
"The European Parliament is ready to do a very great deal in order to reach this agreement as quickly as possible."
"We ended the negotiations on 15 November shortly before midnight with the expectation from Parliament that we want to find good solutions to two fundamental matters: flexibility mechanisms, in order to ensure financing of policies resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon, and also solutions related to the participation of Parliament in the process of negotiating successive multiannual financial frameworks."
"We also have such expectations regarding the proposals related to own resources for the European Union."
"We think the European Commission could adopt a decisive role in this matter."
"I am certain that thanks to a mutual readiness to talk, we will reach agreement."
"I would like to emphasise once again that I think the role of the European Commission is crucial."
"Therefore, it is with interest that we await Mr Barroso's speech, in which he will present both the proposed new budget, which is to be put to the vote on 1 December, and a response to Parliament's main expectations."
"Of course, what is to be said by the Presidency - by Mr Wathelet - will also be of particular importance to us, as will what Mr Chastel has to say, too."
"Mr President, I think that the crisis in which we currently find ourselves was triggered by events in Deauville."
"I believe that the President of France and the Chancellor of Germany made a deal with David Cameron in Deauville which involved his agreement to the revision of the treaty for the Stability and Growth Pact in return for the United Kingdom's budget demands being met."
"I may be wrong, but the suspicion is there."
"This would be a deal made at the expense of third parties, in other words, at the expense of the rights of the European Parliament."
"Therefore, it should be no surprise that the third party, in this case this House, is not prepared to go along with this."
"Incidentally, it should also be no surprise that the fate of Europe is being left in the hands of eurosceptic governments."
"In this sort of situation, a government of this kind will test out how far it can go."
"The British Government is currently testing out whether the rest of Europe will accept its prerogatives or not."
"Therefore, this budget or budget debate is also a debate about the direction in which the European Union should develop."
"It is not about money."
"We have agreed on the money."
"I believe that this is an important message for the voters and the citizens of Europe."
"We have come to an agreement on the money and, as a Parliament, we have met the demands of the United Kingdom with regard to the money: a 2.91% increase in spending, not the commitment appropriations, but the expenditure."
"If not money, then what is it all about?"
"It is about the rights of the European Parliament."
"It is about the rights which are laid down in the treaty."
"Everything that Parliament is calling for forms part of the treaty."
"The subject of own resources is covered in Article 311 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."
"Medium-term financial planning is a procedure established in the treaty, for which a regulation must be enacted."
"Flexibility in the budget involves the mutual interest of governments, the Commission and Parliament and their ability, within the framework of budgetary rules, to respond flexibly to short-term requirements."
"It is not about additional spending; it is about how efficiently Europe is governed, at least that is the case with flexibility, and it is about the primary rights of Parliament."
"I am rather surprised."
"The Heads of Government of the European Union are all parliamentarians."
"They are all men and women who have grown up in the parliamentary tradition."
"As Mr Daul has already said, which national parliament would allow its central right, the right to draw up a budget, to be interfered with by the will of the executive?"
"The 27 governments of the European Union are executives."
"However, we must not allow democracy in Europe to be turned upside down."
"Parliament enacts the budget and Parliament controls the executive."
"The wish of the British Government in this case is for the 27 governments to control the Parliament, which is the opposite of parliamentary democracy."
"Therefore, this decision could set a precedent."
"Parliament must not allow its rights to be taken away."
"What happens next?"
"After European taxpayers' money has been transferred to Brussels from the coffers of the Member States, it no longer belongs to the Member States."
"It is the EU's money."
"It must then be controlled by Parliament within the Union."
"After this, the budget must be adopted by Parliament, because the European budget is not adopted by 27 national parliaments or by 27 national governments, but by a freely elected Parliament, in other words, this House."
"Medium-term financial planning, the flexibility clause and the own resources are the three elements which we need to discuss with the Council, not the money."
"We have talked about this over the last few hours."
"I would like to make it very clear once again that Mr Lamassoure and the chairs of the groups have made a great effort to enable us to take what is, in my opinion, a relatively consistent line."
"However, we must not now give up this line."
"We must make it clear to the Council that these three elements concern our rights and not additional spending."
"Any Parliament which allows its rights to be curtailed by a government of any kind should cease to function."
"Therefore, my group has unanimously decided that either we will agree on these demands, which are nothing more than an attempt to reinforce Parliament's rights, or there will be no budget."
"If there is no budget, there will be no ITER project, no nuclear fusion reactor."
"There will be no Galileo project and there will be no European External Action Service."
"The Heads of Government have the choice."
"They can either recognise the rights of Parliament and its projects or they can humiliate Parliament, in which case there will be no budget."
"That is the unanimous line taken by my group."
"(Applause)"
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, I wonder whether the House would agree that, constitutionally speaking, there is another interpretation of the whole idea of separation of powers and checks and balances?"
"In the international arena and on the European political scene, we cannot simply transfer the national model of separation of powers and checks and balances."
"The way I see it - and I wonder whether colleagues would agree with me - is that, in a system of separation of powers and checks and balances, the Council actually represents nation states, and whatever remains after the Lisbon Treaty of the sovereignty and independence of nation states."
"It acts on behalf of nations, whose governments are elected."
"In European democracies, governments are elected via a democratic, electoral system."
"On behalf of their nations and their peoples, they exercise a check and counterbalance the power of Parliament."
"Would the House not agree that there is another interpretation of checks and balances?"
"Mr President, there are many interpretations, Mrs Morvai."
"That much is completely obvious."
"It may be that your interpretation of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU is different from mine. However, this is not about the interpretation, but about the application of the treaty and this includes a clear budgetary procedure."
"Incidentally, you are, as far as I know, a member of the Hungarian Jobbik party, or if not, then a member of another party."
"Please explain to the voters in your country that if we adopt the EU budget, then it will actually be possible to pay out the cohesion funds within the European Union in the long term."
"If there were no budget, then the funding could not be made available."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, in December 2005, there was a Prime Minister who sat here in the House."
"I think one thing we all learned is that we really need to see a seriously reformed budget for the future."
"Let us all together - the Commission, the Council, Member States and the European Parliament - work out how, in the next few years, we can build a consensus for a changed and reformed Europe in which the budget is a rational part of the future and not an unfortunate piece of horse-trading."
"Well, that Prime Minister was Tony Blair, the man who made the last deal on the financial perspectives."
"Here we are now five years later."
"What Mr Blair said is the essential thing that Parliament wants to achieve: the engagement of the EU institutions and all involved parties to reinvent the financing of the Union and to base this financing on rational grounds and not on a horse-trading competition, which is the case today."
"On the figures, let us be very clear."
"It is no secret that Parliament could be ready to accept the Council figures, of course, within a broader deal."
"But we need also to agree on a second element, colleagues, which is flexibility."
"Let us be very clear on this."
"That flexibility is not a concession from the Council side; flexibility is necessary, indispensable, otherwise we cannot finance a number of important issues."
"What is more is that flexibility is an 'acquis'."
"It forms part of the interinstitutional agreement that we have already."
"In fact, the Council has broken its word by refusing this now in this budget."
"Finally, and this is the most important thing, we must agree on the future financing of the Union."
"Therefore, the issue of own resources must be reopened; no doubt about it."
"Let me be clear that own resources is not a question of changing the treaties."
"Own resources is also not a question of new competences."
"It is a question of applying the existing treaties and it is a question of financing existing competences, because the Union was always meant to have its own revenue."
"Mrs Merkel, Mr Sarkozy and Mr Cameron do not know this, but the Union was founded with its own revenue."
"That was the basis of the financing of the Union by the founding fathers."
"However, we all know that with time and a contribution from a certain Iron Lady, the Union lost the link to its own resources, so instead we now have absurd discussions about who benefits more and who benefits less from the Union."
"Not seeking the EU interest but only focusing on the net payment position of every single Member State is what the budget is today in the European Union."
"That is called business for the moment in the budget issues of the Union."
"This way of acting is killing the Union - it is destroying the spirit of unity in the Union and it is destroying the solidarity in the Union."
"I repeat we can only require genuine own resources which can also lead to what a number of countries want, which is to have less national contributions."
"If we do not change the system, governments and not citizens will stay in charge."
"If, on the contrary, we go in the direction of own resources, not governments, but citizens will be in charge."
"In short, you could say that own resources for Europe colleagues means more European democracy; it is the basis for a modern European democracy."
"So I have one request to you Mr Barroso."
"My request is very simple."
"Whatever the format is - a convention, a conference, an IGC with or without national parliaments - do not listen to the voices of the past."
"Go for the future, use your right of initiative and put a formal proposal on the table as fast as possible."
"The pro-European majority in this House is fully behind you and behind that initiative."
"Mr President, Presidents, I believe that if we listen carefully to what everyone is saying, we are at a turning point in the history of the European Union."
"The problem with the budget today, as everyone has said in his or her own way, is a problem to do with the idea of the development of the European idea."
"It is not just a budget."
"What is more, there is something amiss in the idea of the European Union, and it is always apparent in public debates."
"We are witnessing the renationalisation - the completely absurd renationalisation - of European activities."
"Why?"
"Because - and we are all saying it - you want the European Union to successfully resolve problems that you are no longer able to resolve at national level but, at the same time, you want to give the resources for the task not to the European Parliament, but to the European Union."
"That is why we say that we are not defending Parliament's rights, but only the rights of the European Union and the need for the European Union."
"That is why whereas, today, we are agreeing on three points, we actually need to agree on one thing, here, together: whether to take it or leave it."
"Moreover, even if it takes two, three or four months - and it will be tough for everyone - we shall approve the European budget only if there is an agreement on the points we are raising."
"Let us not be afraid, then, if it takes a long time and if, as may happen, we do not vote on the budget in December, or even in January or February."
"If we launch this debate but stop halfway through, we will lose out for the next four years."
"I therefore call on everyone to be responsible with regard to own resources, and Mr Verhofstadt has explained this."
"It is, after all, quite simple, and that is why Mr Lamassoure's idea of an agreement is interesting, because debates must be held in the European public arena with the national parliaments, with government representatives and with Commissioners."
"Own resources represent an opportunity to reduce - I shall say it three times - to reduce - that time, it was for the benefit of all the conservatives - to reduce national contributions and, at the same time, to strengthen the European budget."
"After all, it is not complicated!"
"Therefore, if we can get that message across in the European area, the people of Europe will agree with us."
"I repeat: we need to reduce national contributions and strengthen the European budget."
"Yes, there will be European taxes, indeed there will, but the austerity measures you are currently introducing at national level will be disastrous for you anyway, because we have known for years that austerity kills economic momentum and ultimately achieves nothing."
"I therefore beg you: let us not cripple Europe, because the governments are already crippling their own economies at home."
"My final comment concerns Ireland."
"Ireland symbolises the failure of neoliberalism; it symbolises the failure of deregulation."
"For years, with Mr Griffith, you have been driving us mad with your 'deregulate, deregulate, reduce corporation tax'."
"Well, have you got it yet?"
"This is an economic disaster, and now what is the Irish Government doing?"
"It is crying 'Mummy, mummy, Europe, help us!'"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I would like to reassure Mr Cohn-Bendit that we understand what it takes not to have a budget."
"Contrary to what many people may think, the ECR Group would be delighted to see an agreement between the two arms of the budgetary authority."
"We feel that it is a shame not to have a budget after all these arduous conciliation talks, because the 500 million taxpayers in Europe do not understand why these two distinguished arms of the budgetary authority cannot reach an agreement in the Lisbon Treaty's very first year of application."
"I think the responsibility lies with both sides."
"Parliament does not have to force governments to enter into political commitments that they are unfortunately unable or - for whatever reason - unwilling to make at this point in the midst of a crisis."
"Nor does Parliament have to enforce these commitments over a longer period of time."
"On the other hand, I can also say that the Council has its fair share of responsibility, because a week ago, when we were negotiating in the conciliation, not a single ambassador bothered to make any statement explaining the views of his or her own government."
"Therefore, it was a kind of dialogue between two sides which were not even stating their own proposals."
"The Commission is preparing a new draft based on the 2.91% growth figure."
"At this point, I should like to acknowledge and express my appreciation for the tremendous work Commissioner Lewandowski is doing in that respect."
"We can reach a compromise if we can agree to use flexibility - which is not a good use of terminology, by the way, because we should be using 'reserve' - as part of the interinstitutional agreement for the remaining three years to finance ITER and a few other key projects."
"At the same time, Parliament could decide not to force any political declaration on the Council which is unacceptable to several key governments at this time."
"That is how we can reach a compromise."
"I think Mr Wathelet is working very hard on this."
"I can only encourage you to pursue this, Mr Wathelet, because it will be an even bigger shame if we cannot reach an agreement before the end of this year."
"(Blue card question to Mr Cohn-Bendit under Rule 149(8))."
"Mr President, it is indeed and I think you failed to catch my eye."
"I have a comment and a question to Mr Cohn-Bendit, lest you think that Irish ears are not listening to you."
"Would you accept that your comments in relation to corporation tax will harm, rather than help, this situation?"
"Rather than your disparaging remarks about the Irish looking for help, do you not accept that by helping Ireland, is the European Union helping herself?"
"I say that as an Irish mammy because I think you used that comment."
"Let us be very adult in this House about what we say about other nation states, with respect."
"(Replying to a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, Europe is a political body."
"We have nation states with their own policies and we discuss policies."
"I will continue to say that one of the reasons for the catastrophe in Ireland was the wrong economic policies."
"Greens also participated in this to make it wrong."
"I know that."
"I can say it clearly."
"I am not blind, and I will continue to say that it was the wrong policy."
"If you pursue a wrong policy and it leads to a catastrophe, it is fair to say that it was the wrong policy."
"If it had been the right policy, you would not be in this catastrophe."
"The others who are responsible are the European banks."
"They played casino, but if you lose money as a normal human being in a casino, you have lost money."
"Now the banks are saying that they want their money back too, and we are in a complicated situation because we want to help the Irish people, but we have to say that it is because of the system that we are criticising that we are now where we are in Ireland."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the supporters of the Treaty of Lisbon have emphasised the fact that it does away with the democratic deficit in the EU."
"In reality, the first year has shown that the European Parliament has had to fight with the Council and the Commission simply to achieve parliamentary codecision and democratic control."
"The codecision of Parliament on all budgetary questions is a democratic minimum standard."
"I repeat: it is a minimum standard."
"This Parliament was elected to bring the European ideal to life and to act as a counterbalance to national egotism."
"It is our duty not to compromise which it comes to the involvement of the European Parliament in the negotiations concerning the financial framework for the 2013 to 2020 budgets."
"New tasks cannot be financed by budget reallocations, or at least only to a very limited extent."
"When faced by the tight budgets in the Member States, it is completely incomprehensible that the Council is refusing to discuss the own resources with Parliament."
"The European budget must be a concrete representation of the solidarity of the Member States."
"Otherwise, we will move away from the fundamental idea of European integration and lose the respect of the citizens of Europe."
"The net contributors seem to have forgotten this."
"While their companies are making profits on the European internal market, Germany and other countries are being thoroughly miserly when it comes to overcoming the joint challenges faced by Europe."
"Solidarity has been redefined and one Member State will only help the others when this is to its own advantage."
"The German banks are so deeply enmeshed in the crisis in the Irish financial sector that the lifeline is just as important for the rescuers as it is for those being rescued."
"In recent years, my group has rejected the EU budget."
"We believe that its priorities are wrong and that too little attention has been paid to overcoming the decline in environmental and social prosperity."
"This has deepened the social divide within the EU and within the Member States."
"It is totally unacceptable for major projects such as ITER to be financed at the expense of projects which provide direct funding for students, the unemployed, rural areas and local communities."
"To summarise, it is high time, and I admit this is a somewhat simplistic way of putting it, for us to think more closely about the people of Europe in European terms and not in egotistic national terms."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Mr President, I have a question for Mr Bisky."
"Companies make profits when they manufacture products or provide services which are bought by citizens."
"Is your alternative to this that companies should make losses and manufacture products which no one needs?"
"(DE) Mr President, I understand your economic questions, Mr RÃ¼big, and they are very profound in economic terms, which I respect."
"However, I believe that this is about the relationship between the budget and the European Parliament and its rights."
"That is a different subject."
"It has to do with products, but in a quite different sense."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, let us be honest."
"Negotiations on next year's budget collapsed due to this Parliament's ambition to acquire more power over the financing of the European Union, even though those powers are not provided for in the Lisbon Treaty."
"Such a demand - which translates into the proposal for a European tax - is, and has always been, unacceptable to us."
"There have been threats to block funding to the Member States which refuse to agree to Parliament's demands."
"Believe me, this would be the best news we could give to British and all European taxpayers - those who eventually fund both national contributions and a European tax."
"The auditors have refused to clear 92% of the European Union's expenditure for 2009, and they estimate that at least GBP 6 billion should not have been paid out - a similar amount to that of last year, which has not yet been recovered."
"Blocking funding for those who used EU money irregularly would give the European Union enough resources to cover the noble causes that it claims it wants to support."
"At the same time, it would also give the European bureaucracy a certain degree of credibility."
"But this, I fear, will never happen."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, three equal partners are sitting around the negotiating table for the 2011 budget: the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"The European Parliament has agreed to the budget increase of 2.9% proposed by the Council, but only in combination with a political package."
"In the context of the Treaty of Lisbon, this is a highly justified demand."
"With regard to the extent of the increase, I think it is important to make it clear that we are still working with an EU budget volume which goes back to the time when there were 15 Member States and, therefore, it is geared to a Union of this size."
"However, there are now 27 states in the Union with a range of new tasks to be taken into account."
"In the light of the economic crisis, it seems incomprehensible that we are increasing the EU budget."
"However, we have to take into consideration the fact that almost 95% of the money is returned to the citizens of Europe in the form of direct aid, for example, via the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"It must ultimately be clear to everyone that the current budgetary situation in some of the Member States is self-imposed."
"The fact is that without a 2011 budget, the three financial supervisory bodies cannot be funded."
"Given the current drama in Ireland, it would have been good if these organisations could have begun work yesterday."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that no one can take pleasure in this lack of conciliation on 15 November."
"It is true that we would have preferred to have had an entirely different debate today, with the end of a conciliation procedure that might have culminated in an agreement and in the possibility of this budget being passed in the European Parliament also."
"It is true that we were certainly all disappointed that this conciliation procedure was not a success."
"At the same time, however, I have heard both within the Commission, which has acted as a facilitator, which has truly played its role of facilitator all throughout the procedure, and especially within Parliament, a desire and a reminder of this strong desire to succeed and to seek success rather than failure."
"I have also heard it within the Council."
"It is therefore true that the Belgian Presidency, immediately after the failure - we must clearly regard it as such - of 15 November, sought to resume immediate contact and to press ahead in a bid to ensure that this first budgetary procedure based on the Treaty of Lisbon is a success rather than a failure."
"However, I would remind you that every single one of us will always be able to find reasons not to succeed, and that is how the conciliation process broke down."
"Parliament will always be able to find proposals that the Council has made that it does not agree with, and the Council will always be able to find certain proposals that Parliament has made that are unsatisfactory."
"There will always be a way not to succeed."
"However, I have heard both institutions express a desire to succeed."
"It is important now that we all assume our responsibilities and successfully conclude this agreement rather than remain stuck in this rut."
"Once again, what message would we send if we failed to conclude this conciliation with an agreement?"
"What image would the European Union project convey to the outside world, in this particularly unstable and difficult economic context, if it were unable, at this difficult time, to stick together, as it were, and make the necessary compromises between institutions in order to conclude a budget, in order to successfully conclude an agreement between our various institutions?"
"Let us make no mistake: aside from image, aside from an initial failure linked to this budgetary procedure based on the Treaty of Lisbon, there would also be very real consequences - and they would affect the people of Europe in particular."
"Some of these consequences have already been mentioned, because a provisional twelfths budget means a 'zero growth' budget, not to mention inflation."
"There is also a European External Action Service that could be in difficulty; financial supervision bodies that could be placed in a difficult situation; cohesion policies - I would remind you that the proposed budget provided for a 14% increase in payment appropriations - and, hence, cohesion policy funds that might not be released; yet more problems linked to the 2020 strategy; and political priorities that Parliament holds dear and which had been integrated into this 2011 draft budget, mainly under heading 1a, such as mobility, young people and education - policies that may well not be implemented either."
"Therefore, aside from the negative image that the lack of an agreement could convey, it would also have very tangible, very real, very specific consequences that would certainly not help to improve the European Union's image in the eyes of the citizens themselves."
"It follows that, if we want to reverse this trend, if we want to remain credible, if we want to assume this share of the responsibility, we must take advantage of these last few weeks in order to reach an agreement and emerge from this spiral of conflict."
"Let us be clear: to do so, we need to bear in mind three things."
"Firstly, there is the 2011 budget as such, with its figures, a budget on which - and I have heard it said by a number of group chairs here - an agreement could be reached with regard to the 2.91% increase in payment appropriations."
"We could reach an agreement on the figures as such, on the 2011 budget, on what is, in fact, on the agenda today."
"I should like to reiterate that we know that this entails a number of concessions for the European Parliament."
"We know that, when it comes to the 2011 budget, Parliament has made a number of concessions with regard to its initial demands."
"The second topic that almost all of you have mentioned is the multiannual financial framework for the financing of ITER, which relates to the issue of flexibility."
"Once again, the Belgian Presidency, in seeking to support this principle of agreement, immediately put the flexibility-related proposals back on the table."
"This is the context in which we are working at the moment."
"I would remind you, however, that we will need to be unanimous if we are to take the flexibility issue further, that this must be understood in a number of areas, and, in particular, that it must preserve the neutrality of the budget during the period in which the multiannual financial framework is in force."
"We will also need to take advantage of any opportunities for redeployment and transfer before referring to this flexibility idea."
"However, we can make progress."
"If everyone makes the necessary efforts, I believe we can make progress on this flexibility idea, on this task, and on this objective of financing ITER in 2012-2013, alongside the issue of the 2011 budget in the strictest sense."
"There remains a third topic that you have also mentioned: political declarations."
"On this point, I must say that the Council cannot say any more than what was said on Monday in conciliation, although I know that Parliament was unable to agree with that at the time."
"I know that the commitments that were mentioned seemed too weak to Parliament but, once again, we will have an opportunity again to raise these issues and to debate them between us."
"We shall have to hold these debates because Articles 311, 312 and 324 of the treaty mention a number of consultations that must take place between our various institutions, and we shall ensure that they do take place because they are provided for in the treaty."
"The declaration referred to Articles 312 and 324, pursuant to which we shall have to hold these debates in the future between our various institutions."
"Once again, however, we will hear a whole host of reasons for not wanting an agreement."
"Nevertheless, I have perceived a will to succeed among the Members of the Council and within Parliament."
"Do we really want to act as scaremongers by telling each other that we prefer not to have a budget, not to implement the policies that are provided for in the 2011 budget and not to make a success of the first budget based on the Treaty of Lisbon, or, in fact, do we want to embark on a positive course of action whereby we obtain, one by one, a number of agreements to enable the European Union to move forward and to allow for the implementation, via the 2011 budget, of a number of policies that we have decided to promote?"
"I hope that it really is with this aim in mind that we take advantage of the next few weeks to ensure that this first procedure under the Treaty of Lisbon is a success rather than a failure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by fully exercising their right of initiative, the Members of the Commission have just decided in a meeting held here in Strasbourg that the Commission will be presenting a new draft budget in the next few days, on 1 December at the latest."
"We hope that Parliament and the Council will approve it in the coming fortnight."
"This draft will take up all the points that we agreed upon before the conciliation that ended last week."
"In fact, we were very close to an agreement, and I wish to thank everyone who has worked in this spirit, a true European spirit of compromise."
"It is a shame that in the end, an agreement has not been possible."
"However, I am keen to underline the role of Commissioner Lewandowski, who has contributed all his energy and expertise, the role of many people in this House, but also the very constructive role of the Belgian Presidency, which I thank for having done and which is continuing to do everything possible to reach an agreement."
"I believe that the draft that we are going to present deserves your support and that of the Council, and that it will enable us to come up with a budget before the end of this year, so that the Union may have a budget by 1 January 2011."
"Furthermore, I believe that it would be very difficult to explain to Europe's citizens that in a crisis such as the one we are currently going through in Europe, we are unable to reach an agreement on the budget, which really is a symbol of Europe's ability to respond to challenges, challenges such as the one that Ireland or the European economy is having to face up to at the moment."
"Our proposal will take full account of the proposal made by Parliament to increase the commitments under the headings 'Competitiveness for growth and employment' and 'External relations', through the use of the flexibility instrument."
"It will fix the level of payments with an increase of 2.91%."
"I am convinced that this proposal will enable us to strike a balance that can be supported."
"It goes without saying that this agreement must be clear on matters relating to 'future financing'."
"We must show that all the parties involved clearly understand the implications of the treaty and that close cooperation between the institutions at the highest political level is a natural consequence of our mutual commitment to adopt the best financial framework for the future."
"The Commission will take all the initiatives required for an ongoing and fruitful dialogue at all levels, including amongst the Presidents of the institutions, in order to draw up a common plan that will allow for the necessary decisions to be taken."
"May I remind you of President Buzek's important speech to the European Council on 27 October, which served to underline the enhanced role of the European Parliament, including in budgetary matters, that is laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, a role that I have also had the opportunity to draw attention to, by supporting your President's speech before the 27 Heads of State or Government."
"I would like to be very clear on the Commission's position regarding a number of key points."
"First of all, as emerged from the recent review of the budget, we will use our right of initiative to present formal proposals on own resources before the end of June."
"Clearly, pursuant to the treaty, the European Parliament will have to be consulted on these proposals, which is in line with the expectations arising from the interinstitutional agreement concluded in 2006."
"Secondly, we will argue the need to take full account of the changes envisaged by the Treaty of Lisbon when we present proposals, both for future budgets and for the multiannual financial framework as a whole."
"The budget must reflect the Union's revised priorities arising from the treaty."
"I must also make it clear that, as the review of the budget has shown, the flexibility in our budgets means that the resources that we have are concentrated on the Union's political objectives."
"Therefore, flexibility must be clearly maintained to allow for adoption by a qualified majority of revisions of less than 0.03% of gross national income."
"To this end, I sincerely hope that we will receive positive news very shortly from the Council, so that we have the right political conditions to ensure the success of the 2011 budget adoption procedure."
"The recent review of the Union's budget, as presented by the Commission, has clearly shown the importance we give to optimising the added value of EU expenditure."
"We cannot waste the opportunity that we are being given to ensure that the Union's budget really makes a difference by promoting our ambitions and implementing the objectives of the treaty."
"The Commission will draft a methodology aimed at demonstrating the added value of the budget, and we are also prepared to set about quantifying the costs of a 'non-Europe'."
"We must state very clearly that the advantages of Union membership cannot just come down to numbers and figures."
"While we are focusing on the costs of the budget, we must also focus more closely on those who really benefit from the Union's policies and not only on the annual budgetary costs."
"Ladies and gentlemen, these are clear commitments that I am making before you today, on behalf of the Commission."
"I will confirm them in writing to the Presidents of Parliament and of the Council."
"If it helps to obtain this agreement, we are also prepared to reiterate them in the form of declarations to be annexed to an agreement between the Council and Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I know that many people, on all sides, have felt during this debate that the next multiannual financial framework will be a crucial test for Europe, and I share their point of view."
"It will be a test of our ability to bring about real change for millions of Europeans, to use this powerful tool to stimulate our ambition for a Europe focused on growth and sustainable jobs for the future, a strong Europe on the international stage, and a Europe based on the values to which we subscribe."
"It will also be a test of our ability to draft an intelligent budget, focused on the areas in which resources can best be deployed and culminating in tangible results, and not on a misdirected budget, because preference was given to political compromise rather than to the quality and efficiency of our spending."
"However, as the last few weeks have shown, it may be, above all, a test of our system of governance, of our ability not only to present sound arguments but also to recognise that the strength of our Union and of the Treaty of Lisbon lies in finding the best solutions to achieve our shared objectives."
"The proposals that the Commission will be presenting next June require major efforts to achieve the necessary consensus."
"The Commission will be open to any ideas on how to structure the debate around our proposals on the solid foundations of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the issues at stake in the discussions currently being held are huge."
"They deserve our full attention."
"I am convinced that all the parties will be determined to reach an agreement."
"We have the broad outline of a solution based on the possibilities being offered in the current conditions which, I would stress, are very, very sensitive conditions that require all of us - Parliament, Council and the Commission - to be more responsible than we already are."
"We must not forget that we are discussing the budget and not a secondary issue."
"We are discussing one of the main tools that the Union has at its disposal."
"This tool, far from being a luxury that we can do without during difficult periods, is absolutely essential if we wish to restore growth in Europe, create employment and generate prosperity."
"The European budget is different from national budgets."
"I would emphasise this point because people are sometimes very quick to make comparisons."
"For a start, the European budget has no deficit: it is always balanced."
"It is different from the Member States' budgets as it is primarily an investment budget that contributes to growth, and we know how much we need this investment right now."
"This tool is therefore too important to be jeopardised."
"Europe needs the European Union to have a budget."
"It is not a budget for Brussels, but a budget for the European citizens."
"It is a budget for unemployed people who are currently looking for a new job."
"It is a budget for the regions of Europe."
"It is a budget for innovation in Europe."
"We must therefore make it clear that it is not a budget for bureaucracy and bureaucrats."
"It is a budget for the people of Europe."
"We must prevent the disruption that further disputes would cause and any uncertainties linked to provisional twelfths."
"They are not simply uncertainties; they are real losses for real citizens."
"If provisional twelfths alone were applied, our citizens would not understand how issues, even very important ones, could hinder a budget that has a direct impact on the livelihoods and prospects of citizens throughout the Union."
"This is why I am confident that, with an additional commitment - and I appeal to the European spirit, especially of those who failed to show it last time - it will be possible to have a 2011 budget and to lay the foundations for a truly serious discussion on the prospects for financing the European Union in the future."
"(DE) Mr President, the Conference of Presidents is meeting at 17:00 at your invitation."
"I would not have spoken again at this point if Mr Wathelet had not made these remarks."
"In the light of the fact that the Conference of Presidents will be discussing and deciding on the next step for Parliament at 17.00, I would be grateful if we could have Mr Wathelet's speech."
"I must say that what has been said represents a step backwards."
"It is less than what we have so far heard from the Council."
"If that is the Council's line, then I must say to you, Mr Wathelet, and this is not an accusation directed at the Belgian Presidency, that we have tough, confrontational times ahead of us."
"I would like to thank you, Mr Barroso."
"Your remarks have shown that the two community institutions, Parliament and the Commission, are working along exactly the same lines."
"Colleagues, if we go smoothly through our discussion, then at the end of the discussion before 17:00, we can give the floor, together with our order, to President-in-Office Wathelet and he can explain everything."
"Let us be patient."
"This is a very important discussion."
"(ES) Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Mr Barroso, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, my political group wants a normal budget for 2011."
"My colleague, Mrs Skrzydlewska, and fellow Member, Mrs TrÃ¼pel, have worked extremely hard to put forward a viable plan that has the agreement of all the political groups and is consistent with the need for austerity being asked for by the Member States."
"The Members of the European Parliament do not come from Mars."
"We are German, British, Swedish, Hungarian and Spanish, and we are aware of and are experiencing the effects of the extremely serious economic and financial crisis in our own countries."
"Nevertheless, we feel that a strong and well-financed European budget is a valuable and essential tool for restarting the EU economy."
"Blocking, reducing or watering down the European budget is paradoxically contrary to the interests of the 27 Member States and 500 million Europeans."
"If we do not have flexibility for the next three years, we will not implement the post-Lisbon policies."
"Without a political agreement between Parliament and the Council on own resources or cooperation on the next multiannual financial framework, there will be no political or financial stability."
"It is not simply a question of rights, but a question of common interest."
"The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are entitled to come to this House as political opponents, but no one knows whom they are opposing."
"This does not, however, benefit anyone, nor does it benefit the 'cohesion countries'."
"Although there is many a political leader currently interested in the 2011 budget, I would like to remind you that I have 14 years of political experience of budgetary conciliation."
"Nothing that has ever been achieved in terms of budgets over all those years has been achieved through confrontation."
"We have always achieved things through cooperation."
"Posturing, whether in this House or in the Justus Lipsius building, where it also happens, is of no practical use whatsoever."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Parliament is being called upon to confirm its approach, an approach of responsibility, vision and unity."
"As far as responsibility is concerned, we wish to give Europe a dignified budget."
"European citizens, young people, enterprises, farmers, municipalities and regions, workers and the unemployed need a budget with a moderate, sustainable and realistic increase."
"If we do not yet have this budget, it is not the fault of a spendthrift Parliament, which forgets we are living through times of crisis."
"Instead, it is the fault of some selfish, falsely moralistic national governments, as quick to jump on their soapboxes as they are unwilling, as in the case of Great Britain, to relinquish their claim to nearly 30 years of unfair privileges."
"If three governments are selfish and bad, the other 24 cannot be subject to their will but must react, Mr President, Mr Wathelet."
"They must show what they are made of!"
"We hold the future of our citizens very dear when it comes to our vision for the future."
"The Treaty of Lisbon and the EU 2020 strategy set us new tasks, new duties, new ambitions to build a better tomorrow."
"How will we achieve these tasks?"
"How will we put our shared ambitions into practice?"
"What money can we use to enter into another imbroglio, like the Lisbon Strategy, which was never achieved but certainly not for want of trying by the European Parliament?"
"Lastly, when we speak of unity, we mean unity between MEPs and unity with the Commission."
"President Barroso's speech this evening was good."
"We do not need soothing, we need to flex our muscle with reason but with determination We have unity on this matter and this is a valuable asset, an extraordinary strength that represents 500 million citizens."
"(DA) Mr President, I would like to say to both Mr Wathelet and Mr Barroso that I most definitely agree that there should be an agreement."
"Of course we must have one."
"That is Parliament's opinion, too, and it is also why we were so willing to accept the compromise that the Council came up with, because the Council is not in agreement over how big the budget should be either."
"We accepted the 2.91% increase in payment appropriations."
"In return, we have to demand that we have the prospect of getting a proper budget in future years."
"It is a question of flexibility. It is also a question of engaging in a dialogue regarding the budget for future years."
"This issue of flexibility is a very tangible one."
"With the aid of flexibility, we have been able to fulfil new requests."
"We would not have been able to get energy projects off the ground as part of the recovery plan - for example, by linking electricity networks from the Baltic countries with those from the Nordic countries, or linking the gas network in Bulgaria with those of Western Europe, so that Russia is no longer able to cut off our heating - if we had not found the money for this in the agricultural budget."
"We need to have this sort of possibility of moving resources around in the EU budget."
"We must, therefore, have flexibility."
"It is also important for there to be constructive dialogue between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, including with the national parliaments, concerning the EU's budget after 2013."
"The European Parliament must not be placed in a situation where we can only say 'yes' or 'no' to the medium-term financial perspectives."
"There is a risk that we will say 'no'; there is a risk that it will go the same way as it did with the SWIFT agreement."
"The EU's own resources are to be reformed again."
"It is not a question of creating an EU tax burden; it is about creating a transparent and comprehensible system, without special rules and without rebates, so that we have a system that citizens can understand."
"We need a debate now, and I am therefore pleased that the Commission has promised to take the initiative and come up with a proposal before next summer."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to emphasise once again that for this House, this self-assured European Parliament, the important issue is to honour the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This is not about going beyond the terms of the treaty, as Mr Barroso has already so rightly said, but it is about keeping to the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon with regard to the additional powers for Parliament, ensuring that the Council does not turn back the clock and adhering to the arrangement on how we work together and how we come to an agreement between Parliament and the Council."
"This was laid down in 2006 in the interinstitutional agreement."
"All we want is for this to be confirmed again."
"Thank you very much, Mr Barroso, you have rightly highlighted this issue once more."
"Mr Wathelet has now attempted to persuade the House not to make such rapid progress towards a genuinely pro-European future, but instead to hold back."
"If we do that, we will already be admitting defeat."
"As Mr Schulz has said, this is, in fact, about a political dispute."
"How will we handle the increased powers of the European Parliament and the Member States which are behaving in a more and more eurosceptic way?"
"If we want the European Union and its citizens to have a powerful future, including at a global level, Parliament and the Council must reach a pro-European consensus."
"Therefore, we must not give in at too early a stage."
"Instead, we must fight for European added value, because this is in the interests of both the national governments and our citizens."
"(CS) Mr President, as Mr Schulz said, this is not just a debate about the budget, but it is also a debate about the future form of the European Union, and that is a fact."
"It can clearly be heard here that beneath the budget debate, among other things, there is a hidden debate on how best to push through the European Union's own financial resources, and therefore greater autonomy, and how to actually move the European Union further along the path to federalism."
"In my opinion, of course, this is something quite unacceptable, which cannot and must not happen."
"Moreover, I have to say that it is now tiresome to hear the persistently unfriendly tone towards the Council here, and that it is childish to listen to the various ultimatums and threats."
"If the European Parliament takes this path, and if the confrontational tone we have heard from a number of Members continues, only one thing will happen: the European Parliament will be the loser, both with the media and with the public."
"(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, millions of Portuguese workers are going to go on strike."
"They are going to go on strike with a very simple message: it is not those who work, it is not pensioners, it is not young people, and it is not the unemployed who should pay for a crisis for which they were not responsible."
"The current deadlock over the European budget cannot be understood without analysing its context, which is one of social tragedy and austerity policies that are being imposed on our countries."
"Austerity policies are not just unfair: they are a colossal economic mistake which promise to drag the European Union back into recession, which promise a future of unemployment, and which, above all, promise to accentuate the divergence between the countries in surplus and those in deficit."
"In this context, we must be very clear about this debate on the budget."
"We do not believe that there can be a currency without a substantial budget behind it and - let us be realistic - the 2011 budget under discussion is not just modest: it is a mediocre budget; it is a budget that does not respond to the crisis but is part of the crisis."
"That is exactly why it is important it is not repeated in 2012, in 2013 or after 2014."
"This is the issue that we are discussing; the issue of the future: do we want a Europe controlled by governments or a Europe that continues to be a Trojan horse for the interests of the financial system?"
"In fact, the European left is interested in discussing own resources."
"We do not want new taxes on the European public, but we definitely do want to discuss how to make financial capital pay what it has not been paying: pay what it owes."
"That is the message that the public - the workers and the unemployed - are demanding from this House and from the European Union."
"Either we want a European project that has so little ambition to fly that it barely makes it off the ground, or we make it clear that we will not be content with the scenario being put to us by the United Kingdom and a group of governments, which is 'do more with less money, because that is the Europe that we are offering you'."
"(FI) Mr President, we really have an excellent situation now."
"The European Union is in crisis; all its institutions are in crisis."
"That is the situation we sought, and that is the truth."
"Now there is an opportunity to grow."
"Centralised power and monetary policy did not work in the Soviet Union and they will not work in the West either."
"There is no single currency; there is only taxpayers' money in different parts of Europe."
"While national budgets are being cut at the same time - in Finland they could not even find EUR 1 million for a hospital for rheumatic diseases - my voters at least - and there were 130 000 of them - do not want me to be the EU's representative in Finland, but the Finnish taxpayer's representative in the EU, and that is what I intend to be."
"Nothing comes of a centralised policy."
"First Greece fell, now Ireland is falling, and behind them are Portugal and Spain."
"The exercise will soon be over."
"(NL) Mr President, how pleased I am with the position of the UK and Dutch governments, in particular, so far!"
"Using excellent arguments, they have managed to prevent the increase in the EU budget for 2011 and have refused to agree to the introduction of own resources, for which, read European taxes."
"Well done, I say."
"At the same time, I do have to say that I regret that the European Parliament is not willing to learn anything from the lesson that Member States are teaching it."
"The Euro clique, removed from reality as they are, thought they were just going to get a little bit more money for their own hobbies."
"They have now completely lost touch with what is going on in the minds of their own citizens."
"They keep asking for more and more, while Parliament and the Commission should just be marking time or even cutting their spending."
"Not a bit of it."
"The Netherlands and the other Member States have extremely good reasons for rejecting the increase in the EU budget and the introduction of European taxes."
"We are doing this for democratic reasons and find it entirely inappropriate that some in this House, such as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), seem to think that the Netherlands ought to be punished for that."
"As a founding member of the EU, the Netherlands has almost always been the largest net contributor to the EU budget."
"We are talking about Dutch taxpayers' money."
"Is Mr Daul now going to call for sanctions against other Member States?"
"Is this the end of the EU?"
"One might almost wish it were, considering how the interests of our citizens are being bargained away."
"That is really sad, Mr President, but it is we who are then going to be subject to accusations of being populist."
"If populism means that we are listening closely to what people are saying, that we are representing them and offering really watertight arguments about extracting ourselves from the economic crisis, which the EU has also forced upon us, then I shall be happy to wear that title with pride."
"Obviously, we will continue to oppose the increase in the 2011 budget and European taxes."
"By the way, Mr Schulz, before you start, I am not blond."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is this debate about money and power?"
"No, it is not."
"The engine of European development is spluttering."
"The revenue side of the budget has been waiting for a reform for years."
"The Treaty of Lisbon said that income had to be provided from our own resources."
"So why not?"
"Why can we not deliberate on this?"
"For years, experts have been saying that the European budget is inflexible, that this is what renders the European Union a lame duck."
"So why do we not create a flexible budget?"
"We cannot respond to the challenges of a rapidly changing world while hogtied - hogtied by a seven-year budget - but, at the same time, we should not disregard those basic European principles which state that differences of opinion must be resolved in an open debate and through compromise."
"It is unacceptable that there are states which are not even willing to engage in a debate."
"This means the end of the European spirit."
"We continue to be open to discussion, and the responsibility lies with those that are reluctant to engage."
"Some say that political issues must not be linked to budgetary ones."
"Quite the contrary!"
"The history of the entire European Union has been about this."
"Please research for yourselves!"
"Here, we represent the people, and cannot look them in the eyes while presenting them with magnificent feints again and again: the 2020 programme, the Lisbon Programme, and we have no means to implement them."
"It cannot go on like this any longer!"
"It is not the Council arguing with Parliament."
"It is those who are unable to comprehend the spirit of the times who are arguing with those wishing to have a functioning Europe."
"Mr President, first, let me say thanks to the Belgian Presidency because it is really trying, but they need to do a little bit more."
"The European Parliament has shown a lot of goodwill in accepting the figures for 2011 because we understand the economic situation in the Member States."
"Regarding commitments, it is even, in real terms, a reduction of the budget."
"We have also offered solutions to a number of practical things like ITER institutions, like the financial supervisory authorities and the External Action Service; we have been constructive."
"But we do not accept that the economic crisis will be here for ever and that the crisis should set the limits for the future of Europe."
"We do not accept that single-minded austerity is the way out."
"We do not accept that the crisis requires less Europe or an anti-European agenda."
"More concretely, we have criticised the lack of flexibility in the European Union budget for years, and the Commission agrees with us."
"So how can the solution to the budget problems suddenly be to restrict flexibility?"
"How can the future of Europe be to cut funding of mutually agreed priority programmes and not fund new ones - ITER is not the only priority - or even the most important ones."
"Without reasonable flexibility, we risk building up a mountain of problems for 2012 and 2013."
"Let us try to avoid that."
"How can it be a problem to involve the European Parliament in a constructive dialogue on the future financial framework and the next long-term budget?"
"I do not understand."
"Let us try again to find an agreement, but we must find a solution to flexibility that is not less ambitious than what we already have in the interinstitutional agreement."
"We must find an open and constructive procedure on the next financial framework."
"That is our red line."
"Please, Council, try again."
"(SV) Mr President, it is easy to agree with much of what my fellow Members have said."
"For me and many others, this has actually been a question of a genuine concern about the future, a concern about how we are to get through the years ahead and the coming decade."
"It is important to remember that we have jointly succeeded in agreeing on a quite - or rather very - ambitious 2020 strategy for Europe - a strategy that is to take Europe forwards."
"However, it is naive to believe that such a strategy will finance itself or implement itself."
"It is surely also a given that this strategy and its successes will not merely be a question of money."
"Unfortunately, however, this will also come into play to a certain extent."
"Neither the Council nor the Commission have yet succeeded in presenting plans for the coming years with which we are sufficiently impressed, which is one of the reasons why we ended up in the state of conflict that we found ourselves in recently."
"I would like to say to the Council that you very much like to be included in the family portrait after having approved the Treaty of Lisbon and succeeded in agreeing on the 2020 strategy."
"All of the eminent people happily stand there and tell everyone how much they like Europe, but when it comes to doing something and actually implementing these things, the Council suddenly has problems."
"These are problems that are now reflected in the fact that we suddenly have a budgetary crisis, and these are problems that the Council, as pointed out here, ought to attend to and find solutions for, because the fact is that this is not just about next year's budget; it is about the future."
"That is the political message that we have for the Council today."
"Mr President, this weekend, a delegation from the Commission and the IMF went to Dublin to give economic advice."
"Another European country has yet again had to come up with a new national budget, and for our friends across the Irish Sea, it is an extremely difficult time."
"There is, of course, a deep irony in European officials opining on a national budget, when the EU's own budget is not yet agreed."
"For many months, my group has warned that with Member States facing such budget pressures at home, it is vital that the EU show restraint in its own spending, ensuring that every penny of taxpayers' money is well spent."
"The last vote in the European Parliament did not show such restraint, and it is, of course, a good sign that there is now agreement on the numbers between Parliament and the Council, though I think we could have gone even lower."
"It is depressing, however, that despite agreeing the numbers, there is still no agreement on the budget."
"Our markets are still far from stable; markets are nervous when there is uncertainty, and I would urge Members of this Parliament to put aside political ambitions and get a budget agreed."
"(NL) Mr President, the European Parliament is delaying the adoption of the 2011 budget."
"Its demand that it have a say in the funding of the European Union in the long term includes an EU tax, although it has not called it that in so many words."
"In so doing, the European Parliament is leaving itself open to the suspicion that it does not want to play a constructive role in the annual budgetary procedure, in accordance with Article 234 of the treaty."
"That does not bode very well for the financial perspective for the 2014-2020 period with which Parliament so badly wants to be involved."
"With the 2.91% budget increase, the European Parliament has already achieved more than is good for Europe and its citizens and companies and the budgets of Member States."
"It is we who are responsible for making reasonable plans for the 2011 budget."
"That could put an end to these budget constraints which could still prove to be instructive."
"(NL) Mr President, it would not hurt if the European Parliament set a good example, for once, and defended the principle that the European Union should cut its coat according to its cloth."
"At a time when everyone is having to save and when our citizens are having to tighten their belts, arguing for a substantial increase in the EU budget is sending out totally the wrong message."
"The EU is just seizing new powers for itself and wants more money to that end."
"Well then, there are plenty of opportunities for making serious savings."
"According to the European Court of Auditors, the financial impact of irregularities in the agricultural policy accounts for 2-5% of the spending on agriculture."
"The financial margin of error for regional funds is more than 5%, which therefore exceeds the two most important expenditure items in the budget."
"We therefore need better control of how funds are spent and more stringent sanctions for erroneous, unlawful and fraudulent use."
"Instead of just urging an increase in revenue all the time, Parliament should also discuss savings every so often."
"A direct EU tax, which is what the Commission wants, is unacceptable for several reasons."
"It is yet another step towards a European superstate, it will inevitably lead to ever more spending and it will also inevitably lead - as, indeed, Commissioner Lewandowski has admitted - to an increase in the overall tax burden of net contributors, which will just not sell at the moment."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Mr Barroso, I should like to thank the European Commission and the Belgian Presidency for their open, cooperative and indeed European approach."
"In this time of crisis, let us not forget to preserve the future."
"Last year, the virtue contest between governments was about who could spend the most."
"Everyone was opening the throttle."
"This year it is the opposite."
"Everyone is now hitting the brakes, Fine."
"Parliament accepts the figure imposed on the Council by the most thrifty or miserly Member State, but on condition that we agree on protecting the future."
"The Union no longer has the necessary resources to finance its budget."
"Instead of being the primary instrument of solidarity between Europeans, the Community budget has become the battleground for contradictory national interests."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has been in force for one year now."
"It confers on the Union long-awaited new powers."
"Yet no additional resource could be allocated to the 2010 budget, and the same goes for 2011."
"The same is also true for the Europe 2020 action programme."
"At a time when all Member States are committed to policies aimed at massively reducing public expenditure, they have a huge interest in identifying and tapping into potential savings that could be made by pooling some expenses, either between several States or between all 27 Member States."
"Europe, the European vision and European benchmarking can help us spend less."
"For that reason, the European Parliament is proposing an agreement between our three institutions on a method to work together on all these proposals for the future."
"On a personal level, may I add that we will save time by involving national parliaments, as they are sovereign in terms of taxation and budgetary matters."
"Mr President, I would like to stress three things."
"First, if the times are tough for everyone, we need to work together."
"I think the lowest point in our reconciliation was when the Council refused to start discussions, and the second lowest was when it refused to start discussions on the basis of documents proposed by the Commission regarding the political part of our discussions."
"But discussions are in the treaty, and they are in at least two parts."
"First: regarding the multiannual financial framework, in Article 312, it is quite clear that if we do not have discussions before we agree on the new MFF, it will not be successful."
"Regarding own resources - which is perhaps very sensible for the Council - there is no big threat."
"We are not starting with new taxes but we are starting discussions, which is in Article 311."
"I believe that we need a budget, one hundred percent."
"There is no other solution."
"But if we really want one thing - to work together and to start discussions (we do not know what the outcome of discussions will be) - we ask the Council to take part in this joint task."
"I think that we will then make it a success."
"Otherwise, I really hope that you will not go alone, according to Article 315."
"You can do it, but I believe that a joint task will be much better than a separate one."
"(CS) Mr President, I would like to say that I am disappointed over the negotiations between the Council, the Commission and Parliament concerning the EU budget for 2011."
"At present, all of Europe is affected by the economic and financial crisis."
"European governments are affected by falling revenues and the need to repay large debts."
"The European Parliament cannot pretend to be immune from this."
"It is not right in such a difficult situation for Parliament to demand a 6% increase in the budget."
"It is also not right to offer to consent to the budget in return for a promise to give Parliament its own resources."
"In my opinion, the European Parliament's negotiators should not exacerbate the situation in the talks, but, on the contrary, should aim to reach an agreement."
"The citizens, households, firms, communities and states of the EU need stability, and this can only be provided through duly approved budgets, not provisional budgets."
"I therefore call on the Parliament, Council and Commission to agree on the 2011 EU budget as soon as possible."
"Mr President, I welcome this debate on the budget today."
"These are difficult times in Member States and that is a reality that this House cannot ignore."
"From talking to my constituents, it is clear that they believe that those vocalising the need for budget increases are divorced from their economic reality and, furthermore, the whole issue is eroding confidence in European institutions."
"The failure to agree a budget is not due to intransigence, but is largely due to the federalist agenda and the pursuit of that Holy Grail, the concept of own resources."
"An EU tax is out of the question in my view."
"In response to President Barroso's declaration today that he will bring forward proposals for such a tax before June of next year, I would call on Prime Minister Cameron to clearly state that any move in this direction would trigger a referendum in the United Kingdom."
"(PL) Mr President, speaking as rapporteur for the European Union budget for 2011, I would like to emphasise the constructive role which has been played by the Belgian Presidency."
"I would also like to express my thanks for the involvement of the European Commission."
"However, our efforts are not over."
"On the contrary, we should, now, intensify them."
"Personally, I think the fiasco of the 2011 budget negotiations is a defeat for all of us."
"However, I would like to share with you my interpretation as to why Monday's fiasco happened."
"We were witnesses to a regrettable situation in which several Member States prolonged the negotiations until midnight to make them end in failure."
"We did not manage to finish the negotiations on time, because on the part of several Member States, there was simply not the will to talk."
"It is for me, personally, an exasperating and very surprising situation, when around the negotiating table are seated diplomats and deputy ministers of finance and they do not want to talk about finance or about the future financing and the present financing of the European Union."
"It is absolutely incomprehensible and unacceptable to me, because what is to happen next, if the politicians and diplomats do not want to talk to each other?"
"My next point is that the tension concerning discussion of the 2011 budget began because the European Parliament wants to draw the attention of Member States to a problem which we see in the future and which we can already see today: that the European Union continues to take on new roles and start new areas of activity and that it has growing ambitions, but that at the same time, the Member States, which support those ambitions, also do not want to finance those ambitions, those plans, those actions and those new areas."
"We must talk about this growing inconsistency."
"At a time of crisis, it is all the more important to talk about finance and to talk about how the European Union is to be financed."
"Furthermore, the European Parliament is all the more necessary and it is not, at the moment, the right time to make the budget a taboo subject."
"(PL) Mr President, we do, indeed, have a serious budget crisis in the European Union, and as the previous speaker has said, many parties are responsible for this."
"Perhaps Parliament made somewhat of a mistake, here, in what it expected of the negotiations - we wanted to take care of too many matters at the same time."
"This is a problem for the beneficiaries, but it is also, in fact, a serious political crisis which, in my opinion, stems from the fact that somewhere, the spirit of euro-enthusiasm has been lost."
"That spirit of euro-enthusiasm was felt in the European Parliament when we discussed the Treaty of Lisbon, and those who were not very keen on Europe were urged to be more enthusiastic."
"However, when the treaty negotiations ended and integration was improved, the discussions about money and the budget started, and it turned out that instead of euro-enthusiasm, there was euro-egoism and a desire to pay as little as possible for that increased European integration."
"I would like more euro-enthusiasm over the budget."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am concerned, but not about the budget, the interinstitutional agreement or a possible twelve-part budget."
"I have a general concern about the political situation facing the European Union, which has come to light today in the context of the budget."
"I am concerned about the trend for intergovernmental cooperation and about the fact that the increased powers of Parliament are obviously going to be curtailed and that even the agreement made in 2006 is not being respected."
"I am concerned that the Treaty of Lisbon is not being put into effect."
"(Applause) Mr Barroso, I welcome your statements."
"However, perhaps it would have been more helpful if you had come 10 days earlier, to make it clearer that the Commission is on Parliament's side."
"With regard to the three main subjects of our negotiations, the first one that I would like to discuss is the flexibility instrument."
"There has obviously been some movement in this area."
"However, I have recently heard that there have been setbacks during the parallel negotiations in Brussels."
"What is happening there?"
"Is there a possibility, and is this too much to ask, of agreeing on the same level of flexibility that we had before the Treaty of Lisbon, which was the right solution and which was achieved after many years of negotiations, starting with the Agenda 2000?"
"Is it too much to ask in the case of own resources to commit to the continuation of what we - the Council, the Commission and Parliament - said in 2006 in our statement on the interinstitutional agreement?"
"Is it too much to ask that those people who are rejecting the idea of a debate on own resources should try reading the treaty?"
"The treaty states that this debate must take place."
"Lastly, Mr President, is it too much to ask for us to enter into binding political agreements on all the issues relating to assent procedures so that we can prevent crises from occurring and so that we do not find ourselves in the same position on other questions, including external trade agreements and the next multiannual financial framework?"
"If you present these things in the form that you have today, the answer from this House will be a definite 'no'."
"(RO) Mr President, Member States are clearly going through a difficult time from a budgetary perspective."
"On the other hand, it has been very obvious that the EU budget has made a major contribution to the development of every Member State, including net contributors."
"I am surprised that the failure of conciliation was not due to a disagreement over figures, but to the refusal to have a practical discussion about the common future of Member States, in other words, the future of Europe."
"Parliament does not wish to go beyond its remit."
"It wants the treaty to be complied with and to protect the future interests of the citizens who elected it."
"Which points has the Council refused to discuss?"
"The European Parliament's involvement in drafting the MFF is a provision of the treaty."
"This task was performed in 2006 and I do not believe that the 2007-2013 budget was bad for the Union."
"Quite the contrary."
"Flexibility - this mechanism has been used effectively so far and all Member States have benefited from it."
"Own resources - it is precisely the budgetary situation which Member States are going through that should spur them on to find stable methods of funding the European budget which will stop jeopardising the implementation of European policies."
"The new responsibilities under the treaty and the 2020 strategy require funding."
"It is not acceptable for the same institution, the Council, to set targets for 2020 and, at the same time, not approve the financial resources required to meet these demands."
"I believe that we have a duty to reach an agreement."
"We have a responsibility to our citizens."
"We must not allow confidence to wane in Europe's institutions."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this week, we should have approved the European Union General Budget for 2011."
"Instead, we find ourselves faced with a situation where Europe runs a serious risk of having to start the New Year with a provisional budget and greatly hindered by the application of the system of twelfths."
"It is common knowledge that Parliament, the Commission and most Member States were ready to reach an agreement, which was blocked by a minority of countries that refused to open a constructive debate with Parliament on the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I believe that Parliament's position during the negotiations was responsible and moderate."
"Parliament called for the application of the Treaty of Lisbon, and continues to call for it forcefully."
"For its part, the Council has proved itself incapable of reaching an agreement and has shown itself to be deeply divided over matters of fundamental importance, which a minority of States have vetoed, rejecting the idea of opening a debate with Parliament over the rules and procedures that should guide the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Now, however, we are obliged to look to the future, and build the Europe of the future together - and by that I mean the Council, Parliament and Commission - without selfishness or prevarication."
"By agreeing to the limits imposed by the Council on the growth figure, the 2.91% we are all familiar with, Parliament's aim is to send out a strong signal that it is sensitive to the period we are living through."
"We all agree, however, as the Commission also affirmed today, that we should ask for greater flexibility to meet the needs of Europe."
"I agree with President Barroso's words today when he referred to the proposals that the Commission will draw up for the use of its own resources and the adaptation of the EU budget to the Treaty of Lisbon, and I hope for greater cooperation by the Council in building the Europe of the future."
"(PT) Mr President, in the negotiations with the Council on the 2011 budget, the European Parliament did everything in order for agreement to be reached."
"The only demand is to fulfil the Council's undertakings, for example, the Europe 2020 strategy and the need to finance it, and to comply with the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In truth, under the treaty, the European Parliament has to be involved - by voting, giving opinions, or being consulted - in the new interinstitutional agreement, in the next multiannual financial framework and in establishing new own resources."
"These demands are logical, reasonable, in the public interest, and in the interests of preventing interinstitutional risks and conflicts: they are demands that the Council should share and uphold."
"As regards the interinstitutional agreement, it is obvious that respect for the commitments made by European institutions, specifically the Council, is conditional on the existence of flexibility regarding the current multiannual financial framework."
"The Europe 2020 strategy, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor programme, the European External Action Service and the financial supervision entities are some examples of things that need financing."
"The Council needs to take the Treaty of Lisbon on board, both from the point of view of the areas newly under the jurisdiction of the European Union, which are reflected in the budget, and from the point of view of the European Parliament's strengthened powers, not least regarding the budget."
"These changes in fact strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the Union's institutions."
"The use of the Community method rather than the intergovernmental approach makes our governance more democratic."
"I hope that a few national egos do not obstruct the European project of peace, solidarity and progress, or put it at risk."
"Mr President, this has been a most important debate - particularly the political aspects of it - but I think it is also important to talk about some of the practical parts of the debate."
"I am the rapporteur for agriculture for the 2011 Budget, and there will be real implications if we do not reach agreement on the budget for the cash-flow of Member States who have made advance payments to their farmers in recent weeks."
"These farmers are facing financial difficulties and income shortages."
"So there are very real and practical implications and this is just one of them."
"But let me talk about the future."
"Right now, we are debating the future of the common agricultural policy and we are asking that policy to deliver more for Europe in terms of environmental issues, food security and the territorial dimension, and yet all of the debate thus far has been about how can we shrink the agriculture budget."
"I am very concerned that, in this debate about budget 2011, we are projecting a very negative view of the budget for agriculture and the European Union post-2013."
"The two are very much linked and I think we need to be aware of that."
"(HU) Mr President, for the past ten years, we have been telling European citizens that a Treaty on European Union was necessary, and the countries have indeed ratified it."
"For the past ten years, we have been telling citizens that research and development can be better accomplished and financed at EU level."
"We have been telling them that European space policy can be better accomplished at EU level, and we have been telling them that energy research and the fight against climate change can be better accomplished in the European Union than it could be at Member State level."
"When we believed this, stood for this, we thought that we were telling the truth."
"In for a penny, in for a pound."
"If, to this day, we still believe what we have been saying for the last ten years, we must create the necessary budgetary resources, and the primary means of achieving this is flexibility, while the secondary means is the creation of Parliament's own resources, the European Union's own resources."
"Ceterum censeo there is a need for the European Union."
"Mr President, your recent joint statement after the EU-US summit was the first statement in a long time where the Commission exhibited gravitas, optimism, power and solidarity, and also coherence."
"Here we have the paradox of not finding common ground on the budget."
"If we want Europe to be an international power, as we are indeed, we do not have the luxury not to have a budget."
"This is what I wanted to say, and keep up the good work."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the failure of the trialogue represents a major political opportunity to reflect on Europe's recent history."
"The problem is not merely political but also cultural and involves many Member States."
"The current economic and financial crisis is structural and not a passing phenomenon."
"It actually represents a transformation that affects the economy, employment and society of the age in which we live."
"If there is no political and cultural growth with a global vision of Europe, we will not be able to take action to overcome problems linked with the start of the third millennium, such as welfare, research, energy and environmental policy and security, which can be dealt with only by a political coming together of all states making up the Union."
"My message to my fellow MEPs is that while the trialogue has failed, the work carried out by Parliament is distinguished work that fully meets our mandate to represent the people."
"Nowadays, Parliament counts more due to the Treaty of Lisbon and the Council can no longer take a dominant role against the popular sovereignty represented by Parliament ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that the traditional representatives of the European Parliament are calling for extensive flexibility in the budget, but I have noticed that no one has mentioned the interests of the net contributors or the interests of the citizens."
"It is ultimately the net contributors which finance the EU, which were responsible for restarting the engine of the economy after the crisis, which rescued the countries with budget deficits and the euro itself and which are imposing a heavy burden on their citizens."
"In my opinion, it is therefore quite comprehensible and justifiable that these countries and their citizens want to keep to the budgetary appropriations, ensure that the net balance cannot be changed retrospectively on a whim and prevent money from being diverted into different channels."
"Of course, I am not referring here to the aid provided following disasters."
"I am excluding that."
"Equally, the critical approach to EU taxation has nothing to do with an apparent lack of solidarity."
"It is simply due to the fact that the Member States are largely opposed to it."
"For this reason, it is clear that we must retain the ratification by the national parliaments for the sake of subsidiarity."
"(DE) Mr President, firstly, I would like to make it clear, following repeated claims in this House, that during the budget negotiations, we have not requested a single cent more than the Council had offered us."
"This means that we were completely in line with the Council's wishes."
"On the subject of the flexibility instrument, we need it because the Council regularly gets us into difficulties with its decisions on major projects for which it has not made provision for the funding."
"We then have to attempt, together with the Member States, to find a solution for these projects, in order to be able to support them financially and to make sensible plans."
"We have also not demanded more than what is laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Instead, we are calling for compliance with the treaty."
"Nothing else, nothing more and nothing less."
"On the subject of own resources, it is surely not asking too much for Parliament to say that it would at least like to discuss the issue, what form it could take and whether own resources are in place."
"They cannot simply refuse to talk about this and then put the blame on Parliament."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, here is my brief supplement to what was introduced by President Barroso, after listening to the comments of the honourable Members."
"The strategy of the Commission in these specific circumstances is very simple and is based on the simple assumption that unity, not divisions, is what Europe needs to face other challenges."
"I think that the Belgian Presidency is acting on the same assumption."
"Our role is clearly defined in the treaties in the event of agreement - and in the event of disagreement, which was not very likely, but it has happened for the first time in 26 years."
"We see the frustration of millions of beneficiaries throughout the European Union."
"Therefore, we need to respond."
"We understand that we should move quickly and we have taken the first step today to agree on the guidelines, then, possibly on 1 December, to submit the figures, which are no longer controversial, to defend flexibility, which we need, to come up with a proposal on the arrangements for cooperation built on the Lisbon Treaty, and to defend - which is also important - the Commission's right of initiative to present the vision of the future next year."
"It is our common responsibility to deliver what was promised, what is expected by the beneficiaries, what has been built up, as a budget, on the revenue side, while fully respecting the fiscal sovereignty of Member States."
"This is about a modest budget that was rising at half the rate of a national budget, despite the enlargement accommodating over 12 new states."
"This was clear proof of discipline and rigour."
"Therefore, let us carry out the job, while working for a better scenario."
"I am appealing to your sense of responsibility."
"Along with President Barroso, I feel very much encouraged by today's debate in Parliament."
"Mr President, it is true that this type of debate should help us reach an agreement rather than make the situation even more difficult."
"I hope to be able to say that it is really in that spirit that we had this debate this afternoon."
"Yes, there will be progress and we will have to try and find an agreement on flexibility and on financing ITER."
"Yes, this prospect for the 2012 and 2013 budgets will have to be subject to agreement and we are really striving to demonstrate that we have the ability to reach an agreement on this 2012-2013 prospect, particularly on the important issue of flexibility."
"Secondly, yes, we will have debates within the context of Articles 312 and 324 in order to see how, in practice, we can implement and carry this out, and ensure that these articles and these new procedures become a reality."
"We will have to find common ground."
"Today, I heard that the Commission was going to use its power to initiate legislation, whether on the issue of own resources, or for the multiannual framework."
"On the basis of these elements, we will have to get together, we will have to discuss, we will have to make sure that we abide by Articles 312 and 324 of the treaty, which include provisions to the effect that all elements need to be implemented in order to reach an agreement, to have these meetings and to carry out this coordination which would enable these new procedures laid down by the treaty to become a reality."
"Regarding the flexible part for 2012-2013, we will have to implement these Articles 312 and 324 of the treaty, even if, once again - I must emphasise this point - we must ensure that the 2011 budget is passed."
"The credibility of the European Union is at stake."
"Also at stake is the effectiveness of the policies which will only be implemented if the 2011 budget is passed."
"We are only talking about the cohesion policies; that is all we are talking about."
"What is truly at stake here is our credibility and the implementation of our policies."
"Thirdly, let us not vindicate those who do not want a budget so that the EU has even fewer resources at its disposal to carry out its policies."
"However, in order to prove them wrong, undoubtedly we need to support a conciliatory approach and make the most of these last few weeks in order to achieve this approach so that we all benefit from it, despite having had to make concessions."
"Yet at least this is a rationale that entails moving forward rather than backwards, which would be the case if we do not have the 2011 budget in the next few weeks."
"Mr President-in-Office, the Conference of Presidents is just about to start, so some real questions and answers are necessary in this Chamber, because it will be a very important meeting."
"We need to see progress on the part of the Council."
"You have probably had many discussions with the Members of the Council, with the Member States."
"How could you explain this to us?"
"Is it possible to move forward in our direction?"
"We have certain expectations."
"You know them very well, because as a matter of fact, this was the subject of our last questions - three points at the very end on 15 November, a few minutes before 12 midnight."
"It is very important for us to have such an answer from you."
"Mr Schulz, I did hear your question."
"I believe no one has been spared."
"I think that we can either choose the approach of pointing fingers at each other - your fault, our fault - or we can try and convince ourselves to take another approach, with both sides trying to make progress towards this conciliatory approach."
"We could also remain in the state of mind that unfortunately led to a disagreement on 15 November."
"Who is to blame?"
"I could have told you that from the outset, Parliament was certainly going to say that the Council was to blame and the Council was certainly going to say that Parliament was to blame, while both would thank the Commission for having made efforts at conciliation."
"We must try to move away from that kind of approach and make the most of the last few weeks and days in order to start thinking along different lines."
"To answer the President's question, can any progress be made?"
"Yes, progress can be made, because we know that if we act in the same way as we did on 15 November, we would only repeat the disagreement that occurred on 15 November, particularly on the important issue of flexibility."
"Why is this issue important?"
"It is important because in my view, it addresses one of Parliament's major concerns which is to have a number of prospects, at least for 2012-2013, which is when the current multiannual framework ends."
"This is the reason why, on this matter, the Belgian Presidency, following on from 15 November, immediately resumed contacts to try and make progress on these other points too."
"Yes, there are possibilities for agreement in this context, but both sides will have to reverse their rationale and embrace a conciliatory approach in order to achieve results."
"Otherwise, we will unfortunately witness another failure, and I previously touched on the harmful consequences that a failure would have, mainly on the implementation of our policies."
"I think that the citizens of Europe deserve better than that."
"President-in-Office, thank you for your activity during the negotiations and also for the discussion."
"We hope that the result will be positive as soon as possible."
"Thanks also to Commission President Barroso and Commissioner Lewandowski for your contribution to our discussion."
"I have some important remarks to make now and I shall change to my mother tongue."
"The debate is closed."
"I would like to inform you that the deadlines for tabling submissions relating to this item are as follows: motions for resolutions - Wednesday, 24 November at 10:00, amendments - Wednesday, 24 November at 15:00."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 25 November 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"We are currently in a state of deadlock which actually extends beyond the 2011 budgetary procedure."
"This is a delicate juncture which will determine the future of the Union and provide a precedent for future budgetary procedures and the role that the European Parliament will play."
"Parliament's grievances are not ridiculous."
"All we want in practical terms is for the role which Parliament has been assigned by the treaty to be respected."
"Parliament has made a great many concessions during these negotiations and we are still being asked to make many others."
"However, I hope that we will get through this period and that we will be able to vote for the new budget during the December sitting."
"Not since 1988 has Europe seen such fundamental disagreement between Parliament and its institutional partners with regard to the European budget."
"This is an historic moment: will the Council, and particularly the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Denmark, allow themselves to see that Europe is all about pooling resources to do better together?"
"Some Member States are adopting an inconsistent approach: they are cutting their national budgets in the name of restraint and calling on the EU to solve their problems by giving it ambitious tasks to fulfil."
"Then, just as these ambitions are about to be realised, they rebel against the voracious budgetary demands."
"Galileo, ITER, the EU 2020 strategy, the European External Action Service - they all cost money!"
"Will we have to fight each year to obtain a token contribution from stubborn Member States that will subsequently accuse Europe of being ineffective and superfluous?"
"I am therefore in favour of a debate on own resources, of respect for the Treaty of Lisbon and of an ambitious and realistic Europe."
"in writing. - (EL) The intransigent stand by a small minority of Member States is basically an expression of their clear refusal to lay the foundations for prompt and meaningful solutions to the basic needs of European citizens now or whenever they arise in the immediate future."
"We need to address issues which concern European citizens responsibly."
"We must not forget that, over and above the EU's new responsibilities post-Lisbon, the Member States are constantly proposing and adopting new policies and strategies, such as the EU 2020 strategy, which the EU is being called upon to implement; on the other hand, they say that they are unwilling to provide the money to implement them, thereby condemning them to failure before they even start."
"I, too, would stress that the European Parliament is not asking for an increase in expenditure or for more powers than those provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Parliament is clearly arguing that the EU needs to have sufficient resources at its disposal to be able to smoothly implement policies which supplement efforts by the Member States to strengthen employment, investment and overall economic growth."
"Parliament's position is that the EU budget does not form part of the crisis; it is - via investments in critical sectors - the answer to it."
"I am greatly concerned by the confusion surrounding the 2011 EU budget since, on the one hand, we cannot abandon our ambitious plans to build a strong European Union, while, on the other, Poland will take over the Presidency of the EU Council in the second half of 2011."
"If the European Union has not adopted a budget by then and still needs to set one every month, it will be very difficult for our Presidency to discharge its duties."
"We must ask ourselves what is more important: an easy short-term solution, which means giving in to a number of countries and the Presidency, or a more ambitious plan, which may be more difficult but which, in the long term, will make the EU stronger and from which we really will all gain?"
"In my opinion, it is more important for us to build a strong European Union together."
"A European Union of this kind needs its own resources and a strong budget based on the principle of solidarity in order to fund what is needed."
"There are several EU Member States, first and foremost the United Kingdom, which do not even wish to discuss this."
"We cannot afford to give in to national egoisms."
"Presentation of the Commission work programme for 2011 (debate)"
"I would like to remind you that 30 years ago, a terrible earthquake hit some regions of Italy, Irpinia and Basilicata, resulting in the deaths of thousands and thousands of people."
"I believe we must all show our sympathy and offer our condolences and our solidarity both to the families and to the areas that were hit."
"The next item is the statement by JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, on the presentation of the Commission work programme for 2011."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, today I have the honour of presenting the Commission work programme for 2011."
"The presentation marks a beginning and an end."
"On the one hand, the work programme intervenes and launches a new phase of very important political work."
"On the other hand, the adoption of the programme is the conclusion of the enhanced structured dialogue, which was opened with the State of the Union debate in September here in this Parliament."
"The preparations leading to this year's Commission work programme have indeed been a 'premiÃ¨re', and, in my opinion, a very successful one."
"By advancing the implementation of our revised Framework Agreement, we have been able to engage in in-depth discussions on the political priorities for the coming years."
"Throughout this fruitful process, I have been encouraged by the large degree of convergence on the overall direction and on concrete initiatives."
"It is a process which has acted to consolidate what I have called 'a special partnership'."
"European action must focus on those challenges where the EU can bring a tangible added value."
"The 40 strategic initiatives which the Commission commits to present in 2011 reflect the main political priorities that we have identified together."
"For the sake of transparency, the programme moreover includes 150 other proposals which the Commission is working on."
"Sustaining economic recovery and securing our societies for the future remains the overarching priority in 2011."
"Our efforts will continue along three main tracks: strengthening governance, completing financial sector reform and accelerating our implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"Long-term growth must be based on a sound macro-economic foundation."
"Through initiating the so-called 'European semester', and the follow-up to our proposals of 29 September, we will reinforce the European fiscal framework and broaden macro-economic surveillance to prevent imbalances."
"An ambitious financial sector reform is already well under way and important legislation has been accomplished."
"In 2011, the Commission will table the remaining pieces of regulation."
"Key priorities, such as transparency and consumer protection, will be pursued, while a bank crisis framework will aim to prevent and tackle future crises."
"The Commission will seek to support Parliament and the Council in reaching agreement on the complete reform before the end of 2011."
"Europe must keep pace, focusing on our comparative advantages in this 21st century of globalisation."
"When competitors are cheaper, we must be smarter."
"As an example of action at European level, we will develop a more integrated European standardisation system as an important platform for sharpening the competitive edge of our companies, particularly SMEs."
"For Europe to remain competitive and secure more and better jobs, the transition to a low carbon, resource-efficient society must be carefully planned."
"Therefore, bringing together the policies on climate change, energy, transport and environment will be a priority."
"A particular focus in 2011 will be on energy efficiency."
"Adapting to a dynamic economic reality also means ensuring a high level of protection of workers' rights in close cooperation with social partners."
"Key proposals on posting of workers and working time will be developed and tabled in 2011."
"Meanwhile, the revision of the State aid rules applicable to services of general interest will be a tangible step towards establishing a quality framework which takes account of the particular nature of these services."
"With the Single Market Act, the Commission has launched an ambitious process to make the single market deliver on its full potential."
"Our companies should focus on business, not bureaucracy."
"Not least, SMEs are often overburdened or indeed discouraged from pursuing otherwise promising cross-border projects."
"As a concrete example, by clarifying the rules on collectively managed copyrights, we can simplify the current framework conditions, encourage further cross-border activity and release important job-creating potential - not least in the promising digital sector."
"On the demand side, a priority will be to strengthen consumer confidence with our proposal on alternative dispute resolution as an important instrument to speed up the often much too slow process of resolving consumer problems."
"Whether we act as consumers, as workers, as students, as travellers or in any other of the multiple roles we fulfil in modern, everyday life, it is when we experience new opportunities, a reduction in risks, or improvements in the quality of life, that the European Union makes sense."
"This is a European Union at the service of the citizens."
"The ambition of making the EU a tangible reality for citizens must go beyond the single market."
"Strengthening security should always be a means of helping citizens to benefit from the opportunities of the European Union, never an end in itself."
"Our proposal for 'smart borders' will facilitate travelling in and out of the EU while deterring irregular immigration."
"To keep Europe open, we will also take action against those that try to exploit our economic system for illegal purposes, while the framework for data protection will respond to a very real concern of citizens in the Internet Age."
"The Union must play a role in the world that matches its economic weight, so we must ensure coherence in our external action."
"As such, the work programme announces concrete action to project our 2020 objectives for jobs and growths internationally."
"We will also modernise our development policy and humanitarian aid."
"Those in the world in need really need a stronger Europe in the world."
"Before concluding, I would like to briefly explain what you will not find in the Commission work programme and why."
"As announced, we will submit the proposal for the next multiannual financial framework by mid-2011."
"The specific financial instruments and programmes will be presented in the second half of 2011 in conjunction with the overall framework."
"To maintain the political nature of the work programme, implementation work as a rule has not been included."
"The same applies for international negotiations, as their conclusion depends on third parties."
"Meanwhile, these activities remain an important part of our core business."
"We will continue to deliver and to pursue our dialogue with you on them."
"In my introduction, I noted that the work programme was not only the conclusion of our fruitful dialogue, but also the beginning of a next step in our concrete efforts to steer the European Union out of the crisis and beyond."
"Now is the time to maintain momentum."
"We need to find ways to collectively accelerate our work."
"I therefore take this opportunity to encourage Parliament and the Council to engage in trilateral discussions on how to implement the treaty provisions on Union programming."
"In the Commission's view, this could translate into agreements to move forward quicker in negotiations on selected initiatives of particular importance to attaining our political objectives."
"Such a concerted effort would demonstrate our determination to deliver concrete, timely responses in the face of the crisis which has shaken us all."
"Europe's citizens would expect this."
"I believe the European Union institutions should respond to citizens' concerns."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, President Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, Europe must overcome the crisis."
"Europe's economy must be founded on work."
"We must steer the countries of the European Union out of the current grave crisis by concentrating, as our main priority, on providing work opportunities to as many European citizens as possible."
"For this reason, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) wholeheartedly supports job creation as the most important objective of the European Commission's work programme for next year."
"Europe has learnt much from the crisis."
"This year, we have embarked on the development of a new economic governance system in an accelerated procedure and hope that Parliament can debate the new proposals related to financial regulation and economic governance next year in a way that ensures their adoption as soon as possible."
"My PPE colleagues will raise important issues for each area, and I would like to mention only a few: competitiveness must be based on innovation and research."
"We believe that there are not enough initiatives concerning this area in the Commission's work programme."
"There is a need for the increased protection of intellectual property rights and a viable competitive European patent system, as well."
"We believe that the increased control of European food imports is important and that they should be subject to at least the quality requirement that the European Union expects of its own producers."
"We would also have liked to have seen more proposals concerning the water issue set by the Hungarian Presidency as one of the major objectives."
"Ladies and gentlemen, based on the Treaty of Lisbon, a new order of the European Union's legislative and work programme began in September this year with Mr Barroso's speech on the State of the Union."
"Since the new treaty guarantees Parliament strong rights to intervene in the European Union's programme, we believe that further measures are important."
"Unfortunately, previous experiences are not good."
"The Commission's earlier work programmes were only partially realised according to plan."
"As I have already mentioned several times, I question, together with a number of my fellow Members, the point of wasting immense energy and time on many occasions each year analysing and adopting a document which, in any event, only covers the reality in part."
"For this reason, I would like to suggest that Parliament's competent committee regularly examines the implementation of the Commission's work programme in the course of the year as well, in order to better enforce the influence of the citizens we represent on the EU's joint affairs."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Å efÄoviÄ, I believe that we can support much of the content of this programme, Mr Barroso."
"However, you will, I am sure, understand if we look at the more critical points today, where we want to see more being done."
"We live in a Europe which is increasingly under the influence of anti-European forces that are fighting against the institutions of the European Union."
"We need to consider carefully what materials and methods we can use to oppose them."
"I will come back to this point later on."
"The first issue is growth policy."
"Mr Barroso, it is right that we must regulate the financial markets and put safety nets in place."
"However, we must also somehow return to the situation that you have often clearly described, in other words, to what we understand by green growth or green jobs and the restructuring of the economy."
"Mr Oettinger has recently published a series of documents on energy policy which involved huge investments."
"Unfortunately, the documents do not explain how these investments are to be financed."
"We must emerge from this crisis with an active growth policy in place."
"I am wondering where in the energy sector or the transport sector, for example, investments of this kind can be made in order to bring about green growth or create green jobs."
"We simply do not have enough."
"My second point concerns the internal market."
"You are right, Mr Barroso."
"The concept of the internal market must be made public."
"You have proposed several reports based on Professor Monti's work."
"He was very critical of the social dimension of the internal market in particular."
"More needs to happen in this area."
"Most importantly, we are waiting for concrete proposals from you concerning the Posting of Workers Directive."
"We must make it clear in the interests of the workers that this directive must not be used to create cheap labour."
"Its purpose is to improve social welfare."
"My third point relates to tax policy."
"We believe that the proposals made in this area are too weak."
"As we have just seen in the debate on Ireland, certain countries must not be allowed to set lower tax rates in order to attract businesses and then, when they get into financial difficulties, to call on other countries to finance their budget deficits, if I can put this in such a simplistic way."
"Tax harmonisation is necessary to a certain degree, for example, minimum rates of corporation tax."
"I believe that we need to make progress in this area."
"I know that you have difficulties with many Member States, but I believe it is essential, in particular, when it comes to social issues."
"The divide between rich and poor is unacceptable and we must introduce new proposals, particularly in the interests of women, who are especially hard hit by poverty."
"Finally, you have spoken about citizens' concerns, Mr Barroso."
"This is a very important issue."
"However, the way in which we present what we do - and this concerns you as well as Parliament - is also important."
"Many people do not realise that, in the case of a large number of issues, all that we do is to issue incomprehensible press releases about our work."
"We must work together to explain what we do more effectively."
"The citizens' initiative will soon be starting."
"Its opponents will exploit it and use it against Europe."
"We must make sure that the citizens' initiative helps to support and develop Europe."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, times are hard for the European economy and for the European project as a whole."
"We have been devising big strategies such as the climate package, the energy package and the 2020 strategy: schemes after schemes."
"We still do not seem to know where we want to go and what we want to be."
"Why am I saying this?"
"Because wanting to be the best is not sufficient to be the best."
"The reality is that we are adopting strategies we do not all believe in."
"No one - or almost no one - is implementing them and no one is ready to finance them."
"It seems we have too many strategies and a lack of interest in making them a reality."
"And this is why I believe it is time to get back to the basics of what made the European project possible and brought us together: simple natural things."
"The single market should be our big scheme and we should put all our effort into enforcing it, because if we want to be competitive on the world stage, we need more economic integration."
"The only reasonable way to achieve this is through the single market."
"I welcome the Commission work programme, and specifically your proposal on the Single Market Act."
"But that is not enough."
"You have the monetary report."
"You know what is needed - to encourage investment, attract capital and boldly cut bureaucratic expenses."
"We should focus on simple things which have an obvious impact on Europe's competitiveness, such as resource efficiency, cutting energy costs, reforming the agriculture policy, and the future of transport."
"The Commission and Parliament must work hand in hand and ensure that these means match our will."
"We are therefore looking forward to an ambitious multiannual financial framework proposal in 2011."
"Do we need more regulation to tackle the financial crisis?"
"Yes, but only if the aim is to foster Europe's competitiveness."
"In any case, we should avoid adopting an autistic response to the crisis, hoping that the rest of the world will follow."
"If the message we are sending to our citizens and to the world is not that the EU is a pragmatic association of ideas, capital and values, we will not become the global player we want to be."
"Instead of influencing policies in the world, we will be affected by them."
"Now a word on the European Semester."
"The Commission is best placed to identify our strengths and weaknesses when planning work."
"But you should be careful, because what you are proposing to EU citizens and Member States is that they should believe that Brussels knows better, and that politicians in Brussels are closer to the citizen' interests than an MP from their constituency."
"It is a difficult job, and you will commit to this through policy coordination in 2011."
"I hope you will succeed in proving this, in boosting growth and jobs - not for some, but for all."
"Otherwise, we will witness the rise of real anti-Europeanism."
"I wish you good luck."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, it is important to make it clear that we cannot discuss this work programme without considering the current budget debate and without thinking about Greece, Ireland and other countries which may get into difficulties."
"Firstly, I would like to say that, at the end of the budget debate, I heard that you, Mr Barroso, took a very open approach to Parliament's positions."
"I believe that it is genuinely important to be honest when we adopt a work programme of this kind and not to behave as if we could achieve and implement all these wonderful objectives without a reliable budget that does not need to be constantly renegotiated."
"Secondly, the discussions about Ireland have shown how far we are from reaching a real solution and a way out of the crisis that we have got ourselves into because we were too liberal with regard to the financial markets."
"On behalf of my group, I would like to say that your proposals as to how we will overcome the financial crisis and how we will find escape routes contain a few good starting points, but we do not believe that the objective you have set yourself is sufficiently challenging."
"If we look back at the time we have already spent discussing a successful, functioning monetary union within the European Union and if we want to guarantee that we are really taking a step towards economic governance for Europe, it becomes clear that we must not abandon this now."
"We feel that your proposal lacks a positive focus on establishing a common economic policy after the end of the crisis, rather than just tackling the symptoms, and we will continue to work on this area."
"Mr Swoboda has already mentioned green issues."
"I am not satisfied with how the description of sustainable, fair and green growth from the Europe 2020 strategy has been represented in this work programme."
"This is not what we discussed in the context of Europe 2020 and it is relevant that Mr Oettinger is one of the Commissioners who are moving further and further away from the idea of rebuilding Europe in a sustainable form."
"Mr President, next year will be a test for the European institutions as to whether they can support the current economic recovery and enable long-term growth through their policies."
"The European Commission work programme is a key document in this regard."
"However, I would like to say at this point that less legislation can sometimes mean more."
"I am therefore concerned, for example, about the planned regulatory activities of the Commission in the area of concessions on services."
"In this particular case, it has to be said that the area of concessions is now explicitly excluded from the framework of public procurement, which has also been confirmed in many rulings from the European Court of Justice."
"Radical changes would definitely not benefit this area."
"Persons involved in the economy, including those from the public administration side, are worst affected when conditions they have learned to work with constantly change, and they therefore lack certainty as regards their decision making."
"All policies must therefore be adopted a considerable time in advance, so that we can give everyone enough time to prepare during the implementation phase."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, the Commission's reasoning seems to be permanently oblivious to the serious crisis in Europe."
"You even write in your document, I quote: 'The signs of recovery are clear'."
"Where are these signs of recovery for those who are currently unemployed, living in poverty or homeless?"
"Are you aware that we lent over EUR 400 billion of public money to rescue the banks and that this figure is precisely the amount of savings that will have been imposed on the people of the eight countries that are under the austerity plan?"
"Your choices are therefore ineffective."
"In the Commission's programme, I suggest carrying out an assessment of the effects the implementation of the Treaties of Maastricht and Lisbon has had on European workers and citizens."
"In my opinion, the solution is not austerity in wages or budgets."
"Instead, it should be structured around the increase of remuneration from work, improved social protection and solidarity-based pay-as-you-go pension schemes, as well as a contribution of capital income to public finances, thereby establishing a new fiscal justice."
"In fact, why not launch studies straight away into the creation of a tax on capital movements, setting up another credit with a new role for the European Central Bank, which, by means of money creation and another credit, should help Member States to refinance banks for safeguarding work, for education, for training, for all the common public assets with new public services for research and innovation."
"Today, what will make Europe credible is wealth distributed differently, not the straightjacket of austerity and unemployment."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, since creation of jobs is one of the priorities in the programme we have, I would like to draw the Commission's attention to a new era of emigration from southern Europe."
"But I am afraid nobody in the Commission is listening to me."
"Already in Greece, we are seeing huge numbers of young skilled and highly skilled workers emigrate to Australia, Canada and the Emirates."
"The same thing is happening in Ireland."
"On one hand, Germany has announced that it has a skilled labour shortage."
"What I would like to say is that Germany does not have to import skilled labour from third countries."
"Member States that face economic problems could provide skilled labour to Germany."
"I would very much like to propose an initiative, to be taken up with the Commission, developing the notion of added value."
"Why not adopt a labour market with European added value?"
"Within the Member States, we have to face supply and demand."
"We have to strengthen Europe with a European skilled labour force."
"This is missing in the programme and I strongly propose it."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Commission on its ambitious work programme, but we must attempt to align it more closely with Europe's strategic objectives and with the long-term strategy."
"I would like to ask the Commission to look more boldly and less anxiously to the future."
"You have the necessary support from Parliament, while the Council, in particular, plays more of a restraining role."
"The progressive forces must stick together in this case."
"Competitiveness is one of the central issues that we need to deal with, to ensure that Europe remains competitive and that we can achieve our objectives, such as sustainable growth and social growth."
"It is also important that we convey this message correctly."
"Unfortunately, the anti-European forces have a much greater presence, particularly in the media, than the pro-European forces."
"However, everyone is aware that Europe can only move forward jointly in the right direction."
"We must call on the Commission to focus in its overall programme during the next few years on increasing efficiency in the field of energy, in the use of resources and raw materials, and in education."
"Universities and schools must make a contribution to creating a smart Europe."
"The field of research and development faces particular challenges in this respect."
"We need to be aware that the rest of the world is not sleeping."
"We must not look with anxiety to the future and continue with our parochial approach, as is happening to a certain extent in the Council."
"Parliament and the Commission must look to the future together."
"(SK) Mr President, I believe that in this turbulent period we are going through, it cannot have been easy for the Commission to draw up such an ambitious plan, and I would therefore like to begin by offering you my congratulations."
"Despite that, I do have some comments to make."
"The key word of the programme is economic recovery after the crisis, and intelligent, sustainable and inclusive recovery."
"I would like to say, Mr Vice-President, that I am rather sceptical about this."
"In the first place, I believe it is rather premature to talk about a recovery, because, even though there are certain indications, it is still not at all certain that there will be a recovery, and I think we cannot allow ourselves further doubts."
"Moreover, I believe that in many states, the Commission is supporting policies which make recovery rather unlikely."
"Examples of this might include Latvia, Greece and recently also Ireland."
"While it is true that the debt burden is often too high, through restrictive economic policies, we will sooner find that there is no return to growth and that the actual debt burden has increased further."
"I see the attempt to assert budget discipline through introducing more stringent Europe-wide regulations in a similar light."
"Such measures are counterproductive in a crisis."
"In addition, budget discipline will not resolve structural imbalances in the economies of the EU, such as trade surpluses and deficits, for example."
"However, I think this belongs to a longer discussion."
"Where I really do support the efforts of the European Commission is in the regulation of the financial sector."
"I am not quite sure whether the measures proposed and adopted are sufficient, but in principle, they clearly mark a step in the right direction."
"The effort for intelligent and sustainable growth is also praiseworthy, and I understand that the programme cannot go fully into the details, but we do now need much more ambitious formulations and measures in the fight against poverty and the fight for social inclusion."
"Mr President, the Commission's programme contains some worthy priorities: sustaining economic growth, preserving and creating jobs, improving energy efficiency and developing renewable energy sources."
"The SNP Scottish Government, our pro-European nationalist government, shares these objectives and is making the maximum use of its devolved, limited power and is achieving progress on other challenges as well."
"The European Free Alliance Group here, which includes the SNP as well as other pro-European nationalists from Wales, Catalonia and Flanders, are contributing to good government in our own countries, but our ambition is to play a full part in EU decision making too, taking our place as normal independent Member States so that we can exercise the full range of governmental powers at home and work constructively here with colleagues towards a better Europe as well."
"(ES) Mr President, in this time of crisis, in which we find ourselves, there are two main types of policies and actions: preventive policies and actions and stimulative policies and actions."
"Preventive policies are those that currently concern the supervision of financial services, governance and strengthening governance."
"In other words, anything that is going to alert us to the fact that there are problems before the problems overwhelm the European economies."
"However, the second type of policies - stimulative policies - are essential."
"There are three fundamental aspects of these policies, Mr Barroso, Mr Wathelet."
"Naturally, there are more, but I am going to highlight three: research and innovation, the development of a digital society - in other words, the digital agenda - and the internal market."
"The first, research and innovation, is where I find the work programme presented by the Commission to be lacking."
"President Barroso said earlier that the specific programmes will come in mid-2011, but I do not think that is enough."
"I can assure you that I and my group would very much have liked to see a reference to the Eighth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, which does not feature in your proposal."
"(BG) Mr President, Mr Å efÄoviÄ, ladies and gentlemen, discussing the work programme of the European Commission is not merely a formality."
"It is a way of attracting the attention of European citizens and of signposting to the European Commission areas in which it can be supported by the members of this House."
"I will dwell on a few specific topics."
"The coming year will be especially important for the presence of the EU on the global stage."
"Externally, we should see an increasingly more effective European External Action Service, which cannot gain strength without the support of the European Commission as a whole."
"As far as enlargement policy is concerned, we would like the Commission to make use of the new energy generated in 2010."
"We are calling on the Commission to help Croatia to meet the remaining requirements to bring accession negotiations to as early a successful conclusion as possible in 2011."
"As far as the progress of Chapter 23 is of particular importance to us, we expect the Commission to report to Parliament on how the talks have progressed in the first quarter of 2011."
"The other candidate state, which the Commission must monitor with particular attention, is Turkey."
"We expect Turkey to be encouraged to speed up fulfilment of its undertakings in the negotiations process after the 2011 elections and to start work on a new constitution with particular emphasis on fundamental citizens' rights and freedoms."
"We also urge the Commission to regularly inform the European Parliament on the position drafting process for Serbia's application for EU membership."
"We hope that the European neighbourhood policy review concludes with a proposal for appropriate corrections ensuring coherence between policy aims and financial instruments which guarantee these aims."
"In this, the Commission will be able to count on the support of the European Parliament."
"Our objectives in the Europe 2020 strategy must reflect our policy towards neighbouring countries in the Mediterranean as well as the East."
"Thank you, and I wish you success in your work over the coming year."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, we want the European Commission's legislative programme to be in line with Europe's long-term objectives and we believe that there is room for improvement in many areas, although we very much welcome the basic approach of this legislative programme."
"With regard to the internal market, an area which I am responsible for, I would like to say in particular that we want to ensure, on the basis of the paper produced by Professor Monti, that all the citizens of Europe can gain more benefits from the internal market."
"When we discuss the Commission's work programme and when we take the Monti report as our foundation, this means, of course, firstly that the Commission must tackle the requirements of this paper, in other words, it must ensure that the infringement proceedings taken by the Commission against the Member States are strengthened to enable the transposition deficit to be reduced from 1% to 0.5%."
"Unfortunately, there is nothing about this in the work programme."
"Alongside the individual measures which are addressed in this report, such as the digital agenda, mortgage credit, concessions and many others which I will not refer to individually, we believe that it is important in every case that the measures which are announced for 2011 are actually presented in 2011."
"The additional information about the fact that the Commission is evaluating certain legislative plans does not help in this respect."
"Finally, I believe that we should call on the European Commission to carry out an impact assessment of all its legislative proposals, so that we can understand why they are needed."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have made major progress on behalf of the citizens of Europe with the Treaty of Lisbon, because we have included the social market economy among the principles of European policy."
"It is clear that we as Europeans and as parliamentarians expect the social market economy to be turned into a reality."
"Now we are looking at the internal market itself and the issues relating to the internal market as a whole and we can see that some of the things which should have been included have been omitted."
"It is not enough to carry out social impact assessments of European legislation."
"We need a social clause to be put into practice, so that the promises which were made that the citizens would really benefit from Europe are fulfilled and do not simply remain on paper."
"This is not just about the social clause, but also about important issues such as the services of general economic interest, which require special protection."
"It is very important to me that the European Commission finally addresses this question and looks more closely at issues concerning workers than was necessary, for example, in the context of the Posting of Workers Directive, where we are still waiting to find out what will happen next."
"Finally, and now I am slowly starting to get really annoyed, we have been calling on the European Commission for a long time to introduce a system for class actions at a European level."
"The Commission has already carried out six or seven different studies."
"What do we find now in this work programme?"
"Another study has been commissioned."
"We cannot go on like this."
"We want the Commission to finally come up with some proposals and decisions in this area."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, as the coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I should like to emphasise two points in your programme."
"Firstly, strengthening economic governance and initiating the European Semester."
"We were pleased to welcome the package on economic governance."
"Achieving this target is critical."
"In this respect, our group would like to see effective and binding measures that go further than what is being proposed."
"It is also necessary for Parliament to be truly involved in finalising the processes envisaged and in their implementation."
"Legal bases should be found to prevent the treaties from being substantially amended, which would only slow down the implementation of measures that must be taken."
"The second point concerns the continuation of the work on financial regulation."
"The projects are on the table, or will be soon."
"2011 will be a decisive year."
"We appreciate Commissioner Barnier's pro-activeness."
"In 2010, Parliament showed its determination in adopting the supervision package, the directive on alternative investment fund managers and, in all likelihood by the end of the year, the regulation that will set up the European supervision of credit rating agencies."
"We want to continue on the path of a pragmatic, intelligent and effective regulation."
"That is what we are expecting from the Commission today."
"Mr President, first of all, President Barroso talked in his introduction about introducing some measures on posting of workers."
"He was not specific on this, but I would remind him that he made a very specific commitment in the hearings, before he was reappointed as President, to revise the Posting of Workers Directive, so that social dumping would be prevented as a result of its operation and the court cases that arose from it."
"I would like to remind him of that."
"Could I also make the point that it is extremely essential that we introduce legislation to provide legal certainty for those in the Member States who provide social services of general interest?"
"There seems to be a complete blindness on the part of the Commission with regard to the problems that exist in that area."
"I am working on a report on that at the moment and I will come back to this early next year."
"I also welcome the poverty platform, but I have no evidence at all that the Commission is using the 2020 strategy on which the platform is based, for instance, in the current negotiations with the Irish Government about resolving the problems there."
"If the 2020 strategy is not the framework for those negotiations, what is the framework?"
"What is the European contribution to resolving the difficulties in Ireland, other than resolving the issues of the banks?"
"Could I just make one final point?"
"I think it is entirely putting the cart before the horse for any Member of this Parliament to talk here about establishing a minimum corporation profits tax across the European Union without also talking about a common fiscal policy, without also having a budget strong enough to provide the cohesion necessary for weak and peripheral states, and a whole range of other European policies that need to be put in place before we can seriously talk about a corporation tax being the same right across the European Union."
"(HU) Mr President, as the coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I consider the work programme tabled before us to be encouraging and I especially welcome the fact that soon, we will be able to start a debate on the flagship initiative under the cover name 'new skill, new job'."
"I would like to make some political and some professional comments."
"I think it is important that we start consultations in good time and that the Commission takes into consideration not only the agenda suggested by the Council but also the agendas adapting to the needs of Parliament."
"I believe it is important, as others have said, that existing financial resources should back projects and priorities and, at the same time, I consider it important that the adopted programmes should be followed by tracking and monitoring as well."
"Some problems: education."
"We agree with raising educational and training standards, but regret the fact that legislative benefits for occupational diseases are absent."
"I wish to emphasise and remind the Commission that we support more efficient implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive, but oppose all kinds of new directives."
"We believe that the Social Fund, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the European Regional Fund must be used in a synergic manner, with special emphasis on the main priority that is needed to link these programmes, namely job creation and expansion of employment."
"One final remark: the administrative burdens that weigh heavily on economic actors and, in particular, on small and medium-sized enterprises, must be eliminated, and this must apply to European programmes and European funding initiatives as well."
"(HU) Mr President, I will try to be very brief."
"I wish to thank the Commission for this work programme, which must have been very difficult to prepare as the budget is not available to us."
"I, too, wish to mention the points which we would have liked to have included, but were missing."
"We would have liked a legislative proposal to be tabled on the long-awaited industrial policy, and likewise there should have been a step forward with the raw materials policy."
"We would have been pleased to see proposals of a more concrete nature in the Commission's work programme as regards energy efficiency and energy projects."
"We very much regret the fact that the semi-annual evaluation of the research and development framework programme will not take place and wish to stress most emphatically that if agreement can be reached in the budget about the Galileo and ITER programmes, we will be able to return to this issue."
"We would very much welcome a more efficient implementation of the small enterprise policy, which will soon celebrate its second birthday."
"Likewise, we would be glad if this year, when we will have two semesters of successive new Member State presidencies, namely from Hungary and Poland, cohesion and integration within the EU could continue."
"The gap between the eastern and western halves of the European Union, which is visible, for instance, in wages and in other respects, is unacceptable."
"It would certainly be worthwhile to make progress here."
"Finally, we would be very pleased if we could move forward with the Eastern Partnership, which is very important in terms of energy security."
"This is true even if there are people even in Parliament who try to hinder it, for example, in connection with Euronest."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, this work programme presents the recovery of growth and jobs, as well as economic regulation, as key to restoring confidence."
"That is true."
"Our model of economic development can no longer make do with strengthening the enforcement aspect of a Stability Pact that has continually shown its limitations."
"The recovery of growth must be centred on job creation throughout the Union in its entirety."
"We need to look at employment and social standards as indicators of economic power and, from that point of view, emphasise the need to put more thought into the European tax on financial transactions and into a greater coordination between the European Union and the European ministers for employment, as well as into the Union's economic proposals."
"I support the Members who took the floor to highlight the importance of the directive on the posting of workers and on the services of general interest."
"I think that the European Union's digital strategy is a crucial factor for this new economy."
"We should show more recognition of the Commission's ambition on this point."
"With regard to citizenship, the Union should put the citizens back at the heart of the European project, and the increase in financial allocations should not only focus on security aspects, in particular, on managing migratory flows."
"Finally, I would end, Mr President, by saying that, in essence, this work programme for 2011 should be the very example of a policy that addresses in a positive way this temptation for nations to withdraw, which all our Member States are experiencing."
"I believe the European Commission has the power to change things."
"It can rely on a Parliament which will be a proactive force and will support it if it shows more ambition."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Barroso, I would like to make three brief points."
"Firstly, I believe, with regard to external relations, that the Commission, which has a particular responsibility in this area, should take a more conceptual approach to the Eastern Partnership than it has done in the past and should call for a multilateral relationship between the members of the partnership."
"In particular, we should carry out a much more effective evaluation of the Eastern Partnership in our own interest, not only from an energy perspective, and we should make this one of our priorities."
"Secondly, I do not know what the situation is with structural funds in other areas, but the process for the financial management of the programmes for external relations is unbearably slow."
"By the time the money is made available, the political objective is already a year old."
"We have seen this in the case of the Middle East programmes, the Eastern Partnership and in many other areas."
"I know that this also has to do with Parliament and the Financial Regulation of the European Union and that it causes so many problems as a result of the procedures which we had under the Santer Commission 10 years ago."
"However, if we really want to put all this money to good use and to ensure that it does not just have a deadweight effect or always arrive too late, because the train has already departed in the other direction, and to promote our own policy interests, we need some good ideas from the Commission as to how decisions on the establishment and implementation of programmes and payments of money in these areas can be made much more quickly."
"My third point, Mr Barroso, is that the question of the Transatlantic Economic Council and the economic relationship with the USA, and not only its economic significance but also its strategic importance, seem to me not to be covered in sufficient detail in the Commission's paper."
"(RO) Mr President, Europe's citizens expect that in 2011, European institutions will focus on creating new jobs and on social Europe."
"As Vice-Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I wish to express my dismay that you have postponed the White Paper on the future of European transport until 2011."
"This document is vital to both the future financial outlook and the future of the cohesion policy, which we have already begun to discuss."
"I wish to highlight from the work programme for 2011 the importance of the legislative initiatives in the following areas: personal data protection, improvement of information and network security based on public procurement standards and recommendations, electronic signatures and reciprocal recognition of electronic identification and authentication mechanisms."
"These initiatives are absolutely imperative for implementing the digital agenda and achieving the internal market, including in the services sector."
"We are also anticipating with interest the legislative initiative on smart energy networks."
"These networks are necessary both to make it possible to obtain electricity generated from renewable energy resources, in which Member States have made huge investments in recent years, and to prepare the necessary infrastructure for electric vehicles."
"I will say by way of conclusion that the digital agenda and energy efficiency, which are areas that contribute to both job creation and the European Union's competitiveness, should be, along with social Europe, our main priorities for 2011."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Barroso, the Commission has put forward an incredibly wide-ranging programme for 2011 and I would like to make it quite clear that I think it would be good if the prioritisation were improved."
"We now have around 30 Directorates-General and 26 Commissioners."
"I do not believe that every Directorate-General and every Commissioner should have to justify their existence by producing large numbers of legislative proposals."
"I am convinced that it would sometimes be good for Europe if we were to set genuine priorities and restrict ourselves to the essentials."
"Europe's strength lies not in concerning itself with as many issues as possible, but in taking more time for important questions."
"I would like to make some points relating to external trade in particular, as I am the coordinator for my group in this area."
"I would be pleased if we could at last make some progress with the transatlantic relationship, as Elmar Brok has already said."
"The Transatlantic Economic Council has been on the agenda for years, but has not yet had any real successes."
"If we look at how the world has changed during this time and how the economic power of different regions in the world has shifted, we can see that we urgently need to work much more closely with the Americans."
"It would be good if the Commission could remember during the course of its work that the European Parliament is a colegislator in the field of external trade since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force."
"Both sides, Parliament and the Commission, will have to learn how to deal with one another and how to draw up legislation jointly, with regard to external trade in particular."
"I would be very happy if the Commission were to pay special attention to this area and, most importantly, to allow plenty of time for the dialogue and for transparent, joint activities."
"(GA) Mr President, firstly, I welcome the work done by the Commission to advance this agenda."
"The European Union is making every effort to end this economic crisis."
"However, despite the amount of work done and the amount still to be done, we cannot forget the people in the developing world."
"Mr President, as the joint PPE coordinator on the Development Committee, may I say that it is absolutely shocking to understand that, after we agreed to meet a commitment of 0.7% of GNP to assist the developing world, that budget is the first budget - or is certainly in the front line - to be cut every time there is financial retrenchment in our Member States."
"I understand - we all understand - that when GNI goes down, the contribution will go down, but it should not go down as a percentage of GNI and then go down again."
"I ask the Commission to do everything in its power, so soon after the Millennium Development Review in New York, to ensure that Member States face up to their commitment."
"We are not asking them not to reduce their contributions."
"We are asking that they do not reduce their contributions as a percentage of their reduced GNI."
"(MT) Mr President, briefly, I just wanted to say that, due to the economic times we are currently living through, it is easy and natural to focus simply on the economic aspect."
"Europe, however, is not solely made up of the European market but of the European citizen, too."
"Therefore, we must push ahead with the implementation of the Stockholm Programme, because it is the Stockholm Programme, on which we have just reached agreement, that will lead us to create a Europe for our citizens."
"In more concrete terms, what we need for next year is further development to counter terrorism and ensure general security for our citizens, because our citizens are demanding more security from the European Union."
"We must also strengthen our fight against organised crime, especially in the area of corruption."
"Furthermore, we need to reinforce our citizens' rights in, for example, the protection of victims of crime."
"Finally, we need to create a single common asylum and immigration policy that is based on the principle of solidarity."
"Thank you very much."
"(LT) Mr President, the work programme for 2011 presented by the European Commission really does seem rather ambitious."
"I hope that this document becomes a founding document for the future - a more competitive, more united and more prosperous European future."
"Nevertheless, in the past, there were many ambitious documents and plans, not all of which were implemented."
"I remember well how, a few years ago, those countries that are now experiencing a huge financial crisis were held up as an example of how to conduct financial and economic policy."
"Today, however, life has brought massive changes."
"I therefore entirely support greater monitoring of the financial market, the creation of a common energy market and the development of principles to integrate countries into our economy to a greater extent."
"Only then will we be able to ensure in future that the European Union is more competitive, and that our people will be better provided for in terms of jobs and incomes."
"Mr President, reading the Commission work programme for 2011, one principal point stands out: use of the crisis to grab power for the Commission."
"Coordination of economic and fiscal policies, broader and enhanced surveillance of fiscal policies, better coordination of macro-economic policy and, more chillingly, new enforcement mechanisms."
"We have heard that this will produce smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, but if we look at the Commission's Europe 2020 document, it is disarmingly frank: 23 million unemployed, 4% fall in GDP in 2009."
"As long as we embrace globalism, we shall not dig ourselves out of the crisis."
"The 2020 document refers to Member States being the most innovative in the world, but if emerging low wage economies are able to steal inventions with impunity, innovation will not help us."
"We must protect our economies from piratical and slave-labour economies."
"2020 refers to the people of Europe as talented and creative; perhaps we should follow demographic policies that foster those talents and protect and preserve that creativity."
"(PL) Mr President, the Commission work programme is ambitious, but I think there is one thing missing - I would like the Commission to place greater emphasis on the implementation of rules, laws, strategies and policies which are already in existence."
"We are creating more strategies and drafting new documents, but very many things are simply not being put into effect, particularly in the field of energy."
"Therefore, I think this should be a separate, special item in the Commission's work."
"If the Commission does not make sure that laws which have already been passed are put into effect, it will simply not be very credible and will lose its legitimacy."
"This is also how we allowed major financial problems to occur in Europe - when we did not observe the Maastricht criteria."
"Many countries slowly began to ignore them or violate them, and now we have very great problems."
"Yes, this may be rather unimpressive, it may not look very good on paper, but I think it is crucial for the work of the Commission."
"(LT) Mr President, although the Commission planned to revive job creation as soon as possible, in the area of employment and social affairs, the Commission work programme for 2011 sadly does not contain specific proposals on the creation of new and good quality jobs."
"Again, the Commission proposes the same legislative initiatives on the posting of workers and working time as it did in the work programme for the previous year, and pledges to improve the rights of migrant workers throughout the European Union."
"However, that really is not enough."
"We are having a thorough debate on the future of pensions in the European Union and one of the proposals is to increase the retirement age, but the Commission has not provided specific proposals on the employment of elderly people."
"Secondly, under the conditions of the economic and financial crisis, illegal work and the shadow economy have grown significantly."
"There really is a lack of concrete proposals on how we should combat this malady together."
"Thirdly, in order to overcome poverty and really reduce the number of people living in poverty in the European Union, I truly hope that the Commission will introduce a directive on minimum income as soon as possible."
"(PL) Mr President, when drawing up the work programme, continuation is always assumed on the one hand, and changes are assumed on the other."
"In what proportions, and what will the relationship be between them in 2011?"
"Without doubt, work related to exiting the crisis, improving economic growth and creating jobs should be continued."
"Our objectives for 2011 have, therefore, been established."
"The number of strategies which we have adopted is sufficient."
"However, we have to change the depth of reforms related to economic governance."
"This can be seen in the Monti report in the area of essential measures for the single market."
"We must act similarly in the reform of financial institutions and their supervision."
"2011 should be a year of implementing measures which have been adopted and a year when the new agencies commence operation."
"An improvement in competitiveness can occur mainly by a growth in efficiency, with the use of innovative and modern methods."
"Finally, a further important task is work on the objectives and the multiannual financial frameworks for 2014-2020."
"It is necessary, here, to concentrate on improved economic integration in the future."
"(SK) Mr President, the work programme submitted is ambitious."
"It includes areas which will help to fulfil the 2020 strategy."
"Much is said there, but I would rather inquire into what is not said, or not fully said."
"Specifically, how does the Commission want to prioritise the accelerated adoption of urgent proposals?"
"I place the emphasis on accelerated adoption."
"We all know what a lengthy business European legislation is."
"I would also like to ask - the programme ends by emphasising cooperation between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council."
"My question is: Do you think that constructive cooperation with the Council is possible when there is no tone of cooperation being sounded by Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank all the honourable Members for their positive and kind words concerning the Commission's work programme."
"If you look through your interventions, you will see that there is a considerable convergence in the goals we would like to achieve together."
"I think it is because the Commission's work programme was, to a great extent, our joint endeavour."
"The structural dialogue we introduced this year, the intense communication between the committees and the Commissioners really paid off."
"We ended up with a Commission work programme that contains the converging aims between Parliament and the Commission."
"Several of you highlighted the importance of focusing on appropriate implementation, so that our programmes and proposals would not simply stay on paper."
"I absolutely understand this request and, therefore, we also included in the Commission's work programme monitoring of the ongoing work."
"I will be very happy to come to Parliament on a regular basis and to brief you on how we are progressing and implementing the Commission's work programme so we can have a debate, not just once a year but on a regular basis, about how we are progressing with the fulfilment of the Commission's work programme."
"So far this year, out of the 34 initiatives we promised for this year, we will definitely fulfil 30."
"This is relatively good progress but, of course, we will be ready to discuss this issue further with you and to keep you informed on a regular basis."
"I am also very glad that you urge us to do more, not less, with some exceptions."
"This is, of course, a very welcome tendency from Parliament towards the Commission."
"I agree with all of you who say that we need to do better."
"We have not only to perform well to fulfil our goals, but we need to show that with high quality work, we can use the result as the best counter-argument and best instrument to tackle Euroscepticism in Europe and the ghosts of the past, which always emerge when we face tough times: protectionism, racism, xenophobia and many of the phenomena you have just described here."
"With good work and good cooperation, we can tackle these ghosts of the past."
"It is true that we need a lot of investment in infrastructure, but we are also absolutely sure that we need modern infrastructure."
"If we want to compete on a global level and to preserve our competitive edge, it is very clear that we need to upgrade our infrastructure."
"It is not only important for our economic goals, but it is also important for the greening of our economies and for resource-efficient economies to be developed."
"For that, we need to use, more than ever, the project-oriented EU bonds, we need to engage more with the EIB and we need to find ways to use public-private partnerships more in the future."
"You will also find this in our programme."
"Regarding the single market, I welcome all the remarks and the focus on the single market, because this is really the EU's main crown jewel."
"We have achieved a lot with the single market and we know that we can achieve even more if we can release the potential of the single market."
"We need to get rid of the barriers to the single market that still remain, we need to get rid of bottlenecks and we need to use the new areas of the economy."
"Some of you referred to the digital economy and how much we could improve life in Europe if we used more e-services, e-government or e-commerce, and these are new areas in which we have to engage more."
"Mario Monti presented an excellent report and Michel Barnier used this report as a basis for our range of proposals."
"We started the debate on how to make the European single market better, more open and more competitive, so that it brings us even better results than we have today."
"So let us participate and look at which of the proposals Michel Barnier put on the table could be the most important ones and which proposals should have higher priority."
"I believe that together, we will achieve a better and stronger single market."
"Regarding the administrative burden, as you know, GÃ¼nter Verheugen included in the programme a reduction in the administrative burden by 25% before 2012."
"I am very happy to tell you that the Commission is working very hard so that this limit will be passed."
"Now, we are aiming to reach the level of 30%, but we also need to be very clear that it is not only the Commission that can deliver results."
"Very often, the administrative burden increases at national level when they are implementing European legislation with different kinds of strings attached."
"We need to work on this issue from both levels, from a European level and also from a national level."
"Concerning the importance of the social dimension of the European single market, I absolutely agree with you."
"We learned the lessons of the past and we will be coming with proposals on posted workers, on a time directive and also on the services of general interest, which would reflect this very important social dimension, because we know that the single market will work only when it is embraced by the citizens."
"Therefore, we need to include this very solid social impact assessment in the proposals we make so we know that the proposals we will be bringing to citizens will be accepted and supported by them."
"Ms Tzavela made a very passionate plea related to the potential brain drain, that we are losing young well-educated Europeans who go to work elsewhere outside the European Union."
"Sometimes it is because of remaining barriers on the labour market in Europe, sometimes it is because of a lack of information, but often it is also because our education does not match the needs of European businesses."
"Therefore, I am very glad that in a few moments, you will start the discussion on the new flagship initiative."
"I see that my colleagues, Commissioner Vassiliou and Commissioner Andor, are here."
"They will explain how we would like to do it better, how to match the skills with the needs in such a way that young people will not be unemployed but will bring their potential to the European economy, and we will all benefit from that."
"Several of you highlighted the importance of the regulation of financial markets and the importance of fast decision making and how we should achieve it."
"We have already highlighted that, in future, we need to progress with better coordination between Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"We would like to do it in a new form of Union programming, where we will decide on the priorities, the timing and the deadlines, so we can deliver the results faster and can accelerate the legislative process even at a faster pace than today."
"I can assure you that, as regards the multiannual financial framework, we will do our utmost to bring an ambitious project to you."
"We need your help in explaining at all levels - to the media, to national audiences - the proportions of this debate, how much we in Europe can achieve with just 1% of GDP, the structure of the European budget with almost 95% of this budget going back to national economies with high value-added from the European Union."
"This debate must also be taken to the national capitals and we need to talk to citizens, to inform them about how this budget is structured so we can gain strong support for our ambitious proposals."
"Elmar Brok referred to very important areas in external relations - the Eastern Partnership, the enlargement process - where we also need to work for credibility on both sides."
"We must be very credible in how we negotiate and monitor the criteria that are fulfilled by the candidate countries, but we must also be credible in what we are offering to candidates so that we have trust built on both sides."
"The United States is a very important partner and, if we manage to get rid of some of the barriers to mutual trade, it would be enormously beneficial and I agree that we need to invest more effort in this area."
"On trade, you know that Europe is ready to negotiate and is ready to move, but we need partners."
"We cannot just forge agreements when we are not sure that they will be equally matched by the other side."
"But I agree that we need to be tackling this issue all the time, coming up with proposals and looking for new openings, because global trade will definitely benefit the global economy and this is what most of the world economy needs at this moment."
"Lastly, on freedom, security and justice, we are fully aware that this is one of the areas of major interest and concern for our citizens and this is why we devoted such a large proportion of our programme to this area."
"I am sure that my colleagues, Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m and Mrs Reding, will pay attention to how to tackle all these concerns, which have been raised both in this debate and in the structural dialogue they had with their respective committees."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the part-session in December."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The Commission's work programme for 2011 is clearly based on continuity."
"Among the proclamations of 'intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth' are the guidelines that have prevailed, which have given rise to serious imbalances within the EU, the real divergence of EU economies, the severe crisis and the recessionary outlook that some Member States are facing, with unemployment and deep social injustices."
"It also includes guidelines such as maintaining the irrational criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, liberalisation and the devaluation of the workforce, and I would highlight its insistence on putting forward a new proposal to amend the directive on the organisation of working time."
"It is also worth noting the statement in the programme with regard to financial regulation that most of the measures to bridge gaps which have been revealed by the crisis have already been put forward."
"This shows that the promises to bring an end to tax havens and financial derivatives have fallen by the wayside."
"This shows that financial speculation is continuing unchecked."
"New attacks on citizen's rights, freedoms and guarantees are on the horizon, including the travellers' registration programme, and this is a matter for close attention and active concern."
"The communication from the Commission outlining its work programme for 2011 emphasises coming out of the crisis and stimulating economic growth."
"One significant element is the virtual market, which still has huge potential for development - on condition, however, of the establishment of a truly single market in the Internet."
"In relation to this, I strongly encourage the Commission to complete a thorough implementation of the Digital Agenda, which is referred to in the communication."
"I think use of the potential given to us by information technologies should also be seen as a way out of the economic crisis."
"The development of Internet commerce, measures in the field of intellectual property rights and making the cultural heritage of Europe available online, should be seen as a test of the European Union's effectiveness."
"As rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs in the area of better lawmaking (2008 report), I would like to express my satisfaction at the fact that the Commission has decided to include proposals from my report in the plan of work for the year."
"I am thinking of the greater emphasis placed on ex-post evaluation of European law and the prolongation of the public consultation period for new proposals from 8 to 12 weeks."
"I welcome the fact that the European Commission is starting the coming year with a substantial work programme."
"These days, we are witnessing how the rapidly changing economic, financial and international political circumstances override our plans almost every week."
"I consider it important, therefore, to review the Commission's work programme several times in the course of next year."
"I am pleased that the document names job creation as one of the top priorities for 2011, but at the same time, I regret the lack of legislative initiatives for employment and social purposes."
"The Commission has finally decided to draw up the European Roma framework strategy, but I consider it essential that this be accompanied by draft legislation aimed at integration and prohibiting discrimination."
"When the Barroso Commission was created, it promised that the submission of its proposals will, in each case, be preceded by an evaluation of their social impact; however, I do not see any trace of this in the current work programme."
"I expect the Commission to be ready, from the beginning of 2011, to accept and address citizens' initiatives bearing the signatures of one million EU citizens."
"At a time when, in certain Member States, we see overt and covert attacks on media freedom and infringements of fundamental democratic rights, I consider it particularly important that the European Commission, as the guardian of the treaties, should pay greater attention than ever to government decisions that threaten the independence of the news media, the system of democratic checks and balances and the rule of law, and should, if necessary, take action in defence of fundamental democratic values."
"in writing. - As a woman and politician dealing with gender equality, I am disappointed with the Commission work programme for 2011."
"Women are completely forgotten by and left out of this programme."
"I really had to work to find at least once the word 'women' ... in the Annex."
"Even there, I quote: 'Depending on the outcome of the consultation, the Commission may adopt a legislative proposal on reconciliation, including on paternity and filial leave, in 2012.'"
"'Depending on'."
"'May adopt'."
"'In 2012'."
"This sentence is from a Commission that rushed to produce an empty, so-called Women's Charter in March, and that neglected the Parliament when it came to negotiating the new gender equality strategy, which, I might add, is no more concrete than the Commission work programme here."
"We knew in March that Reding's Charter was only a faÃ§ade with no substance."
"We asked repeatedly for a strong legislative text, but Reding did not want to hear about it."
"Why can we accept a Europe that sanctions Member States when they are financially not in line with EU rules and agreements but we cannot accept a Europe that sanctions Member States that neglect gender equality and compose governments with few or no women ministers?"
"It is not surprising that the three countries which brought about the collapse of the budget negotiations are net payers and, moreover, recipients of the rebate."
"Indeed, there can be no doubt that the UK has commenced the obligatory battle for its rebate."
"The excuses chosen by the budget wreckers are rather feeble."
"It is quite irresponsible to limit budget flexibility in a time of crisis."
"We must, on the contrary, increase flexibility in a crisis."
"The refusal to discuss with Parliament new financial resources for the EU budget in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, and the refusal to enter into dialogue over the multiannual financial framework, constitute sad caricatures of the once-lauded British sense of humour."
"The Commission work programme for 2011 must contain a proposal for a directive to combat violence against women and an EU programme for financing sport."
"The Commission has committed itself to these things."
"It is time they were done."
"Violence against women is currently the most serious manifestation of discrimination against women and is a violation of human rights."
"In Europe, as many as 45% of women - that is 100 million - have been the victims of violence."
"Every day, violence is suffered by between 1 and 2 million European women."
"There is no justification for the delays in drafting a directive on this matter."
"I also draw attention to the question of sport, which, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, is included in the competences of the European Union."
"Once again, the Commission, by appealing to budgetary restrictions at national and European level, has put off presentation of an EU programme in this area."
"I fear that if we accept such an approach, there will never be a programme, because there will always be matters which are more important than sport."
"However, promoting physical activity brings indisputable benefits in the form of an improvement to the health and wellbeing of Europeans as well as to their efficiency and effectiveness at work."
"This helps to reduce illnesses and so reduces the costs of healthcare, and it also combats social exclusion."
"It is also very important to use the potential of older people in the labour market."
"I hope the Commission will take account of this matter, which has been raised many times, in its future proposals concerning employment and the creation of new jobs."
"An agenda for new skills and jobs (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the agenda for new skills and jobs."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, today, there are 23 million unemployed people across the European Union, corresponding to an unemployment rate of about 10%."
"This situation emerged as a consequence of the financial and economic crisis and we have to face dramatic consequences, but this situation did not deter the European Commission from proposing ambitious objectives in the Europe 2020 strategy, and the European Union has set ambitious targets to meet in the not too distant future."
"We have a headline target for an employment rate of 75% for men and women by 2020, and today, the Commission adopted yet another flagship initiative under the Europe 2020 strategy: an 'agenda for new skills and jobs' outlining how we intend to make progress towards full employment."
"It is complementary to the flagship 'Youth on the move' adopted in September."
"Both should contribute to reach our 2020 employment and education targets."
"Yes, the crisis has wiped out millions of jobs."
"Yes, we face increasing international competition, but that is no excuse to shy away from taking action."
"On the contrary, it is a call to act and shape our future."
"Creating more and better jobs is in our hands."
"Employment policy is largely a Member State responsibility but, as EU policy makers, we in the Commission, together with the European Parliament and the social partners, must do our bit."
"We must enable everyone who can work to actually do so."
"We need to allow the workforce to generate new ideas and set up new businesses."
"We need to ensure that the younger generation can benefit from the social model we have developed."
"We need better job quality and working conditions for all employees."
"An agenda for new skills and jobs sets out action in four areas: functioning of labour markets; skills; job quality and working conditions; and job creation."
"The agenda proposes 13 specific actions at EU level to be carried out in partnership with governments, social partners and civil society."
"First, we have to make sure our labour markets function better by carrying out labour reforms that ensure the necessary flexibility and security."
"One of the lessons learned in the past two years is that flexicurity policies have contributed to weathering the crisis."
"We now propose to discuss with Member States and social partners all components of flexicurity and how to improve them, building on the EU common principles of flexicurity."
"The agenda points to flexible, but reliable, contractual arrangements, comprehensive lifelong learning, active labour market policies, and modern social security systems."
"There are highly segmented labour markets in the EU where employees with permanent safe contracts coexist, and sometimes work side by side in the same workplace doing the same job, with employees who live under temporary contracts with few social safeguards and slim prospects of a permanent job."
"To improve the situation and reduce existing disparities, one possible avenue for discussion offered by the agenda adopted today could be to extend the use of open-ended contractual arrangements."
"These would have a sufficiently long probation period and a gradual increase in protection rights, access to training, lifelong learning and career guidance for all employees."
"Over time, this would allow employees to acquire full rights while firms would have sufficient, but decreasing, flexibility during the probation period, removing the inhibiting elements that often prevent employees from taking on new recruits for the long term."
"Second, we need to equip people with the right skills for the jobs on the market today and in the future."
"We know that even now, some employers are struggling to fill vacancies because they cannot find people with the right skills."
"This reveals not only that we need more skills and the right skills, but also that there are persistent mismatches in the EU labour market between available skills and needs."
"In the foreseeable future, there could be even more serious shortages of workers than today - ICT practitioners, doctors, nurses, researchers, as well as people with the green skills to help us move towards a greener economy."
"'New skills and jobs' proposes practical tools in this respect."
"We will bring more transparency on skill needs and promote better matching, namely through the EU skills panorama to help people see more easily which skills are most needed now and in the future."
"Commissioner Vassiliou will be able to say more about this."
"What is clear is that we must work closely with all relevant stakeholders to bridge the gap between education and training and the working world."
"Third, we propose to improve the quality of jobs and ensure better working conditions."
"The EU has very ambitious legislation in this field which needs now to be reviewed."
"Experience with implementation tells us when and where there is room for improvement."
"We need to make sure the legislation works better, that it is in line with new working patterns and new technology, and that it is easier to understand and apply for people and businesses."
"In practice, we propose to review the Working Time Directive and make a legislative proposal aimed at improving the implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive and we will also make proposals in the area of occupational health and safety."
"In addition to reviewing EU legislation, the agenda on new skills and jobs proposes an integrated approach that includes so-called soft instruments from codes of conduct and recommendations to implementing guidelines, benchmarking and exchange of good practices."
"I look forward to discussing these issues with you and I am confident that together with the European Parliament, the Member States and the social partners, we can make them work better."
"Last, but certainly not least, we need to create more jobs."
"Job creation is needed for growth, but there are too many obstacles in the way."
"We propose to improve the framework conditions for job creation, especially in fast-moving and R&D-intensive sectors, by reducing the administrative burden and taxes on labour, and by helping entrepreneurs."
"We also propose action to foster entrepreneurship and support people who are in the process of setting up a business or have done so recently."
"In this respect, one can never reiterate too often the importance of the new micro-finance facility as a tool to help people set up their own businesses."
"The European Union has plenty of talent."
"Let us make sure that the ideas and innovations around lead to the creation of quality jobs."
"Today, the Commission has presented its priorities on how to make progress towards full employment."
"An agenda for new skills and jobs can make a real difference if we all work together."
"I call on you all to play your part in moving forward in our endeavour to reach full employment in Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioners, although befitting Parliament's traditions, we tend to approach proposals with a helpful intention, yet critically, I must say now that I wholeheartedly welcome and support the notion just outlined."
"I am particularly pleased about the definition used by Commissioner Andor in connection with full employment as the target, that whoever is able to and wants to should be given the means and opportunity to work."
"I also support the four main priorities: better functioning labour markets, better quality jobs, more efficient job creation policies and better working conditions, even if we see that it will not be easy to achieve them."
"We agree with what has been said on flexicurity, although I must say that it is indeed high time we talked about the details."
"We use the term frequently and interpret what it really means in a variety of ways."
"In harmony with the basic principles of better legislation, we believe it is necessary to react to changing working conditions."
"Thus, it is justified to review the Working Time Directive, although I wish to point out that we do not feel the necessity for a new directive where the Posting of Workers Directive is concerned, but are ready to discuss implementation and the experience gained in the course of implementation and, if need be, make amendments."
"However, I wish to draw attention to the regulation of atypical forms of work."
"This means entirely new employer and employee relations in respect of both social security and other conditions, and obviously there are still many gaps in this field."
"Mobility must be increased and more attention needs to be paid to the cooperation of state employment services."
"Finally, Mr President, I can see that time is running out, I fully agree that in a sense, low qualifications cost more than the crisis."
"Therefore, we must make sure, for everyone's benefit, that we continue to think in terms of appropriate and flexible training, acknowledging the possibility of formal and informal training."
"Mr President, I listened to the statements by the two Commissioners with a great deal of pleasure."
"In times of crisis, especially acute crisis, we need a vision."
"These two statements give us a vision."
"They are ambitious."
"They set four objectives which I think every European citizen will want to support."
"But - however nice things are, there is always a 'but' - I first of all want to raise the question of security."
"Flexibility and security need to go hand in hand and, in our opinion, priority needs to be given to security."
"The question of education and training is a very, very basic question because, as Commissioner Andor quite rightly said, not only do we need new skills, we need to send the old skills in the direction we want."
"There are issues relating to entrepreneurship."
"We must make it easier for young people to open their own business."
"We must make it easier for businesses to take on more people."
"To close, I should like to refer to Commission Vassiliou's very nice idea: a European skills passport."
"That immediately puts me in mind of seconded workers and I think and ask myself: if I have a passport with exceptional skills and I come from country A and I go and work in country B, will the question of my contract of employment have been resolved?"
"We are at your side; we shall monitor and fight with you."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, I will deal with just one of your four key priorities: stronger policies to promote job creation and demand for labour."
"According to this document, recovery must be based on job-creating growth but, since the economic crisis, economic growth in Europe has been uneven and weak."
"As an Irish MEP, I am acutely aware of how we are being told to implement austerity measures and the real fear is that this will smother any opportunity for growth."
"So my question is: will this agenda for new jobs and growth not apply to Ireland or Greece or, indeed, any country that is implementing these severe austerity measures?"
"Where will the growth come from and, consequently, where will the jobs come from?"
"There are excellent ideas in this document; I am not trying to minimise them."
"One crucial one is how we connect our investment and research and development and innovation to the production system itself."
"There is an absolute necessity to lock the two together."
"Proposals to engage the social economy, cooperatives, mutual societies and micro-enterprises in a sustained effort to provide employment opportunities at local level are very timely and, indeed, I believe that mobilisation at local level and on a not-for-profit basis, through mutual societies, can be a driver for sustainable development."
"The promotion of entrepreneurship will allow citizens themselves to play a real part in our economic recovery."
"The matching of skills to jobs is crucial, but I am very concerned on many fronts, Commissioner."
"Last week, I hosted a meeting in Parliament on social inclusion and mental illness and a mild-mannered lady from Austria said that politicians have to stop talking about jobs and growth - nobody believes them!"
"I do not know about you, Commissioner, but that shook me."
"I am not saying that that feeling is widespread, but it is spreading, and I think that is why our words here have to be translated into action."
"There is a real urgency about this and we need to start thinking outside the box."
"Yes to green jobs, digital jobs, but do not forget local jobs and, as I said, the promotion of a not-for-profit ethos, not as a replacement, but as a counterbalance to the profit-driven model, which right now threatens the euro and the stability of the Union."
"Mr President, Mrs Vassiliou, Mr Andor, we had great expectations of the agenda for new skills and jobs."
"It was intended to create an impetus which would help employees in Europe to prepare for environmental change."
"Most importantly, after Parliament came up with a series of ideas in its resolution on green jobs, we expected the Commission to take up these ideas, develop them further and then propose specific measures which define how new jobs can be created by means of environmental change or existing jobs adapted so that they can be preserved, in order to make European industrial society greener for the benefit of the workers."
"What have you done instead?"
"You have revived the old subject of flexicurity."
"Do you really believe that new jobs can be created by means of deregulation?"
"We have just established that the precarious jobs are the ones which are lost during a crisis and they are the first ones to go."
"All I can say here is that you are wrong if you think that a knowledge-based, sustainable economy can be developed on the basis of uncertainty and poor working conditions."
"Your focus is on poverty through work, instead of on increasing prosperity."
"However, poverty is not a good accompaniment to progress."
"In order to make environmental progress, we need a wide-ranging programme of education and training for all employees and, in particular, for those at lower levels."
"Please continue to work on this agenda and introduce the necessary improvements."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not intend my speech to be the usual eurosceptic exercise in rhetoric but a call for the EU to start to look at the contents more than the packaging and abandon propaganda in favour of hard facts."
"Now that the Lisbon Strategy has failed, the EU has come up with a new slogan 'EU 2020', but it has not actually come up with any innovative response to employment problems."
"The statistics bear this out: the unemployment rate in Europe stands at 9.6%, the youth unemployment rate at 20.2%."
"In Italy, the third net contributor to the EU budget, the situation for young people is even more dramatic, with 25.9% of young people jobless."
"I would prefer a Europe where resources are not wasted in promotional campaigns, but there are efficient investments so that the training available prepares professionals for the internal market sector where there are proper job opportunities."
"I would like to conclude by emphasising the importance of vocational training, a symbol of excellence in our nations."
"The craft sector offers employment potential and a unique wealth of knowledge that must be used to sustain the competitiveness of the European system."
"(IT) Mr President, Mr Andor, Mrs Vassiliou, ladies and gentlemen, we have set ourselves the goal of identifying the needs of the job market in the coming years."
"This means we are speaking of the future of young Europeans, of the professions and the economies that will sustain our communities tomorrow."
"For all too long, we have been wondering about the types of jobs that will be available in ten years, about how qualifications will change and about the skills required throughout the Union."
"We ask ourselves continually whether the education and training currently offered to European citizens will help them find a job easily."
"I wonder how the Commission actually intends to go about adopting new measures to achieve the goals it has set itself."
"Are we sure we know all the needs of young people?"
"Are we sure that e-learning is the solution, or can we study new and more telling forms of education and training?"
"Only six months are left before the pilot project launched in May 2010 concludes, meaning it is already time to draw up budgets."
"Will the results we achieve be positive?"
"Will they be encouraging?"
"We must aim to train young people using European educational policies that are capable of anticipating future needs."
"Not long ago, I heard a long list of things we 'have to do'."
"To use medical terminology, I have heard a lot about diagnosis but not a lot about the cure."
"We must not be content with a lot of hot air but must work with substantial ideas, as the EU 2020 strategy demands."
"This is the challenge that all Member States and enterprises must tackle and this is the best legacy that we can leave to our children."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Andor, Mrs Vassiliou, new skills for new jobs is a very important subject."
"Why is this?"
"Because it is all about the future."
"It is not just about us muddling our way through the challenges that we are already aware of, such as demographic change and the economic crisis."
"It is also about the fact that additional qualifications will give people the opportunity to design the jobs of the future and, therefore, to make an active contribution to an innovative economy."
"Mr Andor, you place a great deal of importance on the social partnership, which is a good thing."
"However, I would like to encourage the Commission to focus on working conditions and the physical and, above all, mental stresses of a busy working life."
"What use is it to society if people produce high levels of performance in the short term, but in the long term, turn into burnt-out wrecks?"
"None at all."
"Therefore, the systematic evaluation of the acquis communautaire should be based on this approach and not on better regulation."
"On the subject of flexicurity, I do not approve of the Commission proposal for a kind of introductory employment contract, which only offers full employment rights after a certain period of time."
"It seems to me rather shabby to treat young people, who are so important for our future, in this way right at the start of their professional careers."
"Does this mean that the Commission is more or less giving up on precarious employment relations?"
"I would very much like to see the Commission making improvements in this area."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Andor, Mrs Vassiliou, it is true that combating unemployment and the goal of full employment together represent one of our most urgent tasks."
"As Mrs Harkin said, the people of Europe do not want concepts; they want concrete solutions."
"I would like to thank you for your initiative."
"There are a lot of positive approaches here which two colleagues from my group have referred to."
"However, I believe that some improvements are needed, because more flexibility and more mobility will not create a single new job."
"I would like to endorse what Mrs Schroedter said in this respect."
"We need good, secure jobs in Europe and the Member States and businesses must ensure that these are permanent jobs which allow people to earn a good living."
"This must become a general rule once again and we must work towards this on a European level and choose the right course."
"In the agenda, you refer to new forms of employment contract with fewer rights for employees who are just starting their careers."
"You refer to these as open-ended contractual arrangements."
"In my view, this will not create any new jobs."
"Experience shows, and the Social Democratic government in Germany found this out a few years ago, that weakening employees' rights will not result in any jobs being created."
"Measures of this kind simply turn secure jobs into precarious jobs."
"We must not allow this to happen in future."
"(RO) Mr President, the timing of this debate is particularly apt, with the EU economy's recovery remaining fragile and Member States still facing a depressed situation on the labour market."
"This is why European society needs to become a knowledge-based society."
"The EU must ensure that there is a better correlation between the demand and supply for jobs and that the workforce has the necessary skills to take up the newly created jobs."
"With regard to Romania, the most recent Commission monitoring report indicates that the labour market has been stable since the start of 2010."
"However, the recovery cannot be accompanied immediately by a reduction in unemployment."
"Unfortunately, young people in Romania are still one of the groups hardest hit."
"More than 20% of them do not have a job."
"In this respect, I think that the European Commission's instrument is useful, given that its prime objective is to boost the involvement of young people in the labour market."
"(SK) Mr President, if we are discussing unemployment, it is surely necessary to cry out loud about unemployment among the young, which runs at twice, and in some countries, four times the European average."
"I welcome the agenda presented much more than the strategy."
"We must adopt specific measures to support employment and effective monitoring."
"We must definitely boost cooperation between national ministries of labour and education and create a long-term strategy on what the labour market will demand from potential job seekers, and not just what it demands now."
"Education and training for a profession is a long-term process, and we therefore need to know what we will need in 10 years, and not just now, so that we can support the next generation."
"The Commissioner mentioned better education and investment in people."
"I fully agree with her on this."
"Only through greater investment in educating the young will we manage to create a competitive generation and a better European Union."
"I would therefore like to call on the EU Member States not to cut education and youth budgets but, in these difficult times, to make them even stronger."
"Every cent more spent on education will produce a hundredfold return in a contented and strong future generation."
"(DE) Mr President, the focus of these measures must be to make the best possible use of the human resources available within the European Union, rather than opting for mass immigration."
"In specific terms, this means developing new, long-term skills, which match the new requirements of the labour market."
"We need a programme of further training for those EU citizens who have interrupted their education either at school, during an apprenticeship or at university."
"In addition, we need incentives for further education, retraining measures and lifelong learning."
"When the labour market is opened up to the countries of Eastern Europe in 2011, the EU will be obliged to take measures to protect citizens in those Member States that will be particularly affected by the opening up of the labour market."
"Less skilled workers and also self-employed contractors in these Member States will be the first victims of this change."
"I expect the Commission to provide these people with adequate protection against unemployment, cheap labour and social dumping."
"(IT) Mr President, Mr Andor, Mrs Vassiliou, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that at a time of such great difficulty for the European Union, the fact of having the courage and determination to carry forward initiatives such as the one submitted by the Commissioners can only be looked on with great favour."
"More targeted training, real education directed at acquiring knowledge and abilities that serve the labour market, development of young people through their training and their knowledge - which must be enriched on a daily basis - and a labour market that needs new skills, but which needs to put migratory flows to the best possible use."
"The four objectives are encouraging, but there is no doubt that we must put the many instruments that the Commission has at its disposal to better use."
"We must be far-sighted and prudent, but by the same token, the new frontier of technology must guide our choices to ensure that the 2020 strategy is consistent with effective training and a real will to pave the way for a labour market that serves European society and, above all, young people."
"(RO) Mr President, the main concern of European citizens is linked to keeping their jobs."
"As a result of the economic and financial crisis, the unemployment rate has reached 10%, with the rate of youth unemployment at 20%."
"Young people and the over-50s are encountering difficulties in finding a job and are often forced to accept temporary labour contracts or a job below the qualifications they have obtained."
"The agenda for creating new jobs and new skills must be linked to the Union's industrial policy and innovation policy."
"In order to maintain the Union's competitiveness, we must not only develop an innovative capacity, but also recreate the production capacity, which means creating jobs in the European Union."
"An eco-efficient economy obviously requires new skills."
"I wish to draw attention to the high school dropout rate."
"An ever growing number of young people are unable to attend a secondary school or university."
"Education guarantees a future for young people."
"This is why it is our duty to guarantee young people access to education."
"Member of the Commission. - I am very happy that the fundamental principles of this flagship initiative to boost and improve employment in Europe and finally reach an ambitious target by 2020 have been welcomed."
"We are, of course, open to discussing the various details now and at a later stage."
"I would like to address some of the points that have been discussed or perhaps even challenged in the discussion, because some of them need further explanation."
"First of all, we maintain the concept of flexicurity, but this does not mean that we want to put the emphasis only on flexibility, in which case we would use this concept the way it was used before."
"I would like to give you some examples where there is clearly a reflection of the current times and a reflection of the new challenges."
"We are definitely making this initiative more age-conscious, and when we speak about lifelong learning, we want to put a greater emphasis on the lifelong learning opportunities of older workers, because we have to assume that active working life is becoming longer and people will have to be assisted more with career changes or career developments."
"We have to have a better focus on young people, which is clearly a key consideration for Europe 2020."
"But a separate flagship initiative - 'Youth on the move' - already exists, where most of the initiatives and strategies in connection with the young generation are outlined in very concrete terms."
"Youth is the age group where we do not want to push for a greater level of flexibility, because there is already enough."
"There is more flexibility for young workers in Europe than in the United States."
"We want to facilitate more mobility, because we believe that the young generation is the one that can better take advantage of the integrated European labour market and develop their own skills and improve their competitiveness through taking advantage not only of the market itself but also of the institutions that the European Union provides."
"What I spoke about was better working conditions and quality jobs."
"I regret that Ms Schroedter did not understand it perfectly."
"We want to address segmentation as a major challenge of the current European labour market, and we put forward a very concrete example: the open-ended contract, which can help."
"It is not about removing people from permanent contracts, it is helping those who, so far, only had a chance to have a short-term or fixed-term contract, to have an open-ended one and build up their rights."
"This will help, to some extent, to provide more jobs, but it will definitely help to provide more rights."
"This is also very important if we want to speak about quality jobs."
"When we speak about investing in human capital, we should not forget that the European Social Fund is there to support all these initiatives in all Member States, and we hope that it will remain a robust instrument of the EU in supporting all these initiatives on employment and social inclusion."
"These are initiatives for 10 years and for all Member States."
"It is not about addressing short-term emergency financial situations in certain Member States."
"We cannot assume that all the 10 years will be spent amidst financial emergencies."
"This is obviously not a policy that can be so specific as to address this situation, but it does apply to Greece and to Ireland."
"It is clear that Greece is one of the countries where more flexibility could help to boost the business investment climate, as is the case with Spain."
"Ireland is a country which could rebalance competitiveness factors and have a greater focus on investing in skills and education, as opposed to other sources of competitiveness that have been extensively used recently."
"We must, of course, pay attention to the very critical situation we are in at this moment, and maybe next year there will be little chance of increasing the level of employment."
"But we also have to look at the overall picture, which will start to improve from the first half of next year, because the major economies driving the recovery forward are already experiencing job growth."
"We believe that, despite the disturbances in the financial sector, this process will continue and the European policies which we have put forward, although not being able to micromanage job creation in the Member States, will create the right framework and provide guidance for the Member States to continue working towards full employment."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The current economic crisis and structural factors such as globalisation, technological progress, an ageing population and the move towards a low carbon economy have highlighted the need to adapt European employment policies and made EU institutions devise relevant solutions for tackling the rise in unemployment and fighting poverty."
"Indeed, the Commission's initiative as part of the EU 2020 strategy offers a response from the European Union to the challenges raised by the current economic climate and the economic and social changes taking place on the labour market."
"I wish to emphasise how important it is to achieve the two objectives mentioned by the Commission in this initiative."
"These are to exit the economic crisis using skills improvement as a tool for doing this and to guarantee the European economy's long-term competitiveness by anticipating future needs and ensuring a harmonious balance between the supply and demand for skills on the labour market."
"Europe needs to increase its competitiveness in an ever-growing global competitive environment."
"Skills provide the key to exiting the crisis and enabling Europe's citizens to improve their standard of living."
"I welcome this initiative which encourages the exchange of information and the involvement of Member States in discussions aimed at identifying solutions or practices conducive to creating new jobs."
"The European Union has very ambitiously committed to increasing employment by as much as 75% over the coming decade."
"In order for this to become a reality, we must take concrete measures both at EU and national levels."
"I feel that it is particularly important to enhance social partnership and social dialogue with specific measures at all levels - EU, national, regional, sectoral and company."
"Secondly, employees' skills and qualifications must be improved continually and must satisfy the needs of the labour market."
"Therefore, it is necessary to bring the general, vocational and higher education systems closer to the needs of the labour market."
"We are constantly hearing that there need to be more jobs, but how can they be created?"
"There must be a specific mechanism providing incentives and certain tax incentives to create jobs for young people and the elderly."
"Furthermore, it is necessary to analyse the impact of micro-finance instruments on the labour market and to allow more flexibility to use money from the European Social Fund."
"I really hope that an agenda for new skills and jobs would provide concrete results for people in our countries."
"in writing. - According to the joint statement of the November EU-US summit, job creation is a priority in the Euroatlantic context."
"The Commission should be alert, however, to the increasing phenomenon of external migration that is being recorded in Greece; young, skilled and highly skilled members of the labour force are emigrating to Canada, Australia and the Emirates."
"It seems that the same process has started in Ireland, as well."
"On the other hand, Germany has announced that it needs skilled labour."
"There is no reason for Germany to import such labour from third countries."
"It could collaborate with the southern Member States to employ a skilled European labour force."
"Is the Commission willing to initiate a sensible employment policy among the Member States supporting the European labour market with a European labour force?"
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B7-0563/2010)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Subject: Young people in precarious employment"
"As the Commission notes in its communication 'Youth on the move', young people are often trapped in a chain of temporary employment contracts that reduces their chances of moving on to more stable contracts and exacerbates their job insecurity."
"The problem is even more acute in Member States where labour law is particularly protectionist."
"Can the Commission answer the following questions:"
"Does it believe that the often doubtful quality and uncontrolled duration of traineeships exacerbate this problem?"
"Will it take specific action as part of the objectives set in the Europe 2020 strategy and the Youth on the Move programme to support youth employment and strengthen their job security?"
"Will the Commission pursue specific and even more targeted policies to promote and strengthen youth employment in those Member States that are facing an economic recession?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, two months ago, the Commission presented the 'Youth on the move' flagship initiative as part of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"This sends a clear signal that the Commission has a special concern for young people."
"'Youth on the move' has three objectives: to improve education, increase employment and foster mobility for young people across the European Union."
"It will involve action to make education and training more relevant to young people's needs, encourage them to take advantage of EU grants to study or train in another country and overcome obstacles to entering and making progress in the labour market."
"The two labour market problems which the honourable Member has raised, namely, traineeships and labour market segmentation, are among the topics 'Youth on the move' takes up."
"I am grateful for the opportunity to explain the Commission's views and aims regarding these two topics."
"I want to stress, first and foremost, that both fall within the Member States' national competence in terms of practical implementation."
"Let me start with traineeships, or internships as they are also sometimes called."
"I know that the European Parliament regards these as very important, as Ms Turunen's report earlier this year showed."
"The underlying problem is that employers are reluctant to recruit young workers with little or no practical experience."
"This is why acquiring initial work experience through traineeships has grown in importance for young people over the years."
"However, they must be of high quality and have clear learning objectives."
"In addition, they should not replace normal jobs or probation periods at the start of a work contract."
"The Commission intends to develop a quality framework for traineeships but, as a first step, we need to improve our knowledge in this area."
"The Commission will soon be launching a study to gain an overview of existing legal arrangements and practice across the Member States."
"This is part of a pilot project involving measures for employment maintenance, for which Parliament has provided the Commission with an extra budget for 2010."
"A second set of issues is labour market segmentation."
"Young people are in a difficult position in terms of job security."
"Too many have short-term contracts, often alternating with unemployment, and many young people - even those who are well qualified - have little chance of getting more stable contracts."
"We need to tackle labour market segmentation as a matter of urgency, in particular, because it affects young people and their employment prospects most and because it endangers the future competitiveness of the European economy."
"A report on employment in Europe, to be released by the Commission in a few days, finds that temporary workers are paid 14% less and receive less training than workers on permanent contracts."
"This has a negative impact on productivity."
"This applies to young people especially."
"Those with temporary jobs account for 40% of the total, against 13% among the overall working-age population."
"This means that young people bear the brunt of adjustment."
"In addition, young people are experiencing more and more difficulties in getting into the labour market."
"The percentage of young people who are not in education, employment or training ranges from about 4% in Denmark and the Netherlands to 16 to 20% in Italy, Cyprus and Bulgaria."
"Reducing labour market segmentation is, first and foremost, the responsibility of the Member States."
"The Commission has identified this as one of the priorities the Member States should focus on in line with the common flexicurity principles under EU 2020 and the European Employment strategy."
"In practical terms, the Commission proposes that Member States with segmented labour markets should consider introducing an open-ended single contract that provides for a sufficiently long probation period and a gradual increase in protection in place of the current legal disparities between permanent and temporary contracts."
"The Youth Employment Framework under 'Youth on the move' gives guidance on how policy makers, stakeholders and institutions can make progress in this area."
"Closer policy coordination under the European Semester, which we are currently preparing with the Member States, will offer the right framework for stimulating the development of policy and reforms that will benefit young people."
"(EL) Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply."
"Today, I read in the European Commission's communications about the adoption of an agenda for new skills and work."
"Today's communications refer, among other things, to the decision to promote an open single contract to replace the various types of temporary and permanent contracts."
"My question is very straightforward: will the Commission be able to guarantee under this initiative that open single contracts will improve young people's sense of security at work?"
"In other words, will the current situation be improved, insofar as it can be improved?"
"(DE) Mr President, obtaining a permanent job and establishing a decent lifestyle are very important goals for most young people."
"They have been hard hit by the most recent economic crisis and are often forced to take short-term jobs or low paid internships, which also means, of course, that they are not contributing to a pension."
"This makes long-term life planning difficult."
"Therefore, I would like to know: Does the Commission intend to put measures in place which will guarantee permanent jobs for young people in particular?"
"Or to put it another way: Are directives being planned which will introduce standards for temporary jobs?"
"(LT) Commissioner, thank you for your answer, because all initiatives are necessary, especially for assessing how young people have suffered during this difficult period."
"However, I would like to ask whether the Commission feels we should adopt a separate European Union youth entrepreneurship and innovation programme which would promote and support young people's creativity and enterprise?"
"Where would you stand as regards opportunities for young people to take advantage of microcredits?"
"Should the procedure for recognising companies established by young people be legally regulated?"
"Member of the Commission. - The previous discussion extensively covered the open-ended contract, which I think is one of the practical solutions."
"In addition to that, we have seen during this year that the Commission discussed the situation of young people and the impact of the crisis on youth employment, and 'Youth on the move' has already addressed this in concrete terms."
"Further initiatives are obviously possible."
"We will have to monitor the situation and work with the Member States."
"During this phase, we have just gathered details of the national programmes developed by the Member States, and after analysing these and looking at the practical solutions and undertakings they made, we will be able to come forward with further suggestions."
"The most important one here, however, is to shape a macro-economic environment in Europe that will facilitate a continued, robust recovery."
"One further point I would like to make is that young people have, of course, been among those who have suffered most from job losses and the lack of opportunities in the last couple of years."
"We are aware of the long-term risk of this which is not just as an immediate employment or social question."
"If we do not take action, it can have an impact on demography trends which are already extremely complicated, so in the next term, in a kind of alliance or cooperation with the Hungarian Presidency, we will discuss this in the context of a demographic discussion, because demography and family policies also have to be looked at in the same context as job security and income security for young people in Europe."
"Subject: Enhancing competitiveness through alternative energies"
"It is the objective of the Commission, and of us all, to guarantee our fellow citizens a comfortable and secure standard of living within a framework that fosters the competitiveness of European companies."
"Use of alternative energy sources is one solution that can help improve the competitiveness of production."
"Unfortunately, few countries can boast impressive figures in this field, and these are mostly in the North of Europe."
"The spread of technologies using alternative energy sources is slow in the new Member States, particularly in the East."
"What incentives and promotional measures has the Commission taken, or does it intend to take, to target Member States that make little use of alternative energies or in which this technology is slow to spread, so that these countries and the European Union as a whole become more competitive on a global scale?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the honourable Member has been speaking about the subject of renewable energy and asking what we plan to do to achieve our joint targets."
"Three years ago, the European Council set us some ambitious climate goals."
"One of these concerns renewable energy, which, by 2020, must make up 20% of the total energy consumption in the European Union."
"Each Member State must exploit the opportunities available to it and make a mandatory contribution to achieving this goal."
"If we divide this 20% across the various different sectors, such as transport, heating, electricity, industry and agriculture, it is clear that electricity generation is the most important."
"In order to achieve the target of 20% of total energy consumption, we need around 35% of our electricity to be generated from renewable sources."
"If we are to do this efficiently and ensure that the price is affordable for consumers, we must make use of the best locations."
"Each Member State has different strengths and weaknesses, which must be exploited, and these include wind from the North Sea, sun in the southern part of the European Union and biogas from rural areas."
"Obviously, in order to ensure our security of supply, we need to make significant improvements in the quality and capacity of our infrastructure, our transport networks and our storage facilities."
"The Commission took this point into consideration a few days ago when we discussed and adopted an energy infrastructure package which focuses, in part, on integrating and feeding in renewable energy."
"We have set binding targets for renewable energy for every Member State."
"In a few days, on 5 December, we will reach the transposition deadline and the Commission will begin following up on the implementation of the directive, in order to ensure that the appropriate incentives have been put in place and that suitable subsidy measures have been taken, which will allow the binding targets to be achieved."
"The Member States must concentrate on creating the ideal conditions for the use of renewable energy."
"Among other things, the European Union directive calls for Member States to produce national action plans specifying the necessary measures and the concrete, binding national targets, broken down by sector, such as transport, heating, electricity conversion and industry."
"The next step involves removing the administrative obstacles to renewable energy."
"A third important area is the construction industry."
"Around 40% of our energy is used in industrial buildings, service sector premises and private homes."
"By the end of 2012, we want qualification and certification schemes to be in place for the installation of renewable energy facilities."
"These include distribution and transmission networks which must be prepared for the development and increase in renewable energy and which must also guarantee priority access for renewable energy."
"The Member States can be flexible in their choice of technologies."
"They can decide which types of renewable energy they will invest in to achieve the binding targets."
"The Commission will subsidise innovations and projects which aim to research into, develop and commercialise technologies for renewable energy, using funding from the seventh framework programme that you in this House have made available to us."
"The Commission also has money from the European Economic Recovery Plan for three years which is specifically intended for renewable energy projects, in this case, for the development of offshore wind energy."
"I would like to emphasise to the new Member States that cohesion programmes and funding to promote renewable energy are also available."
"Renewable energy has a high priority in our energy and climate policy, in particular, with regard to reducing our dependency on imported fossil fuels."
"Only by working together will we succeed in achieving our ambitious climate goals and increasing Europe's competitiveness."
"I am relying on a close partnership with the Member States regarding the use of the different energy resources."
"(DE) Thank you very much, Mr Oettinger, for your clear and convincing answer."
"I believe that the Commission has done a great deal towards achieving these objectives."
"However, in my opinion, it should be possible to provide the public with more information and to win over the mass media, in order to gain more support in this area."
"This is not what is happening in my country, Lithuania, for example."
"Of course, that is the responsibility of the national governments, but the Commission could provide them with assistance."
"My final question is: In your opinion, which states have been relatively successful in meeting the 2020 objectives and which have not?"
"(RO) Bearing in mind that the energy and climate change package already imposes certain targets on Member States for reducing polluting emissions and increasing energy efficiency, I would like to ask you what measures you are taking to support businesses in industrial sectors which are major consumers of energy in modernising their facilities so that they become more energy efficient and cause less pollution."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his very comprehensive response to the question."
"I have two questions, firstly regarding the 2020 strategy."
"Is he confident that we will reach the 20% target for renewable energies in that strategy?"
"Secondly, he mentioned grids."
"How realistic, desirable and affordable would a Europe-wide grid be, and is it attainable?"
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a few weeks, we will be submitting to you, the European Parliament, the Council and the Member States our proposal on how we plan to achieve a 20% increase in energy efficiency."
"Looking at the three targets which you have set us, with regard to the 20% reduction in CO2 emissions, we are making good progress towards this objective."
"I am sure that, if we continue with our current efforts, we will reach or even exceed the target of 20% less CO2 in 10 years."
"On the subject of 20% renewable energy, we are also doing well, although the progress made in the different Member States varies."
"Some Member States were already a long way ahead when compared with the reference year."
"For example, Austria had a 23% share of renewable energy five years ago and is expected to reach a level of 34% by 2020."
"In contrast, the figure for the United Kingdom was only 1.3% and for Malta 0%, which meant that these countries had to start virtually from scratch."
"The leaders include Sweden, which is aiming for 49%, and Finland and Portugal with a goal of 38%."
"The Baltic States, with targets of 25%, 40% and 23%, have also been very successful and their figures are above the European average in this important area."
"The target of a 20% increase in energy efficiency is the one which gives me most concern."
"This involves making intelligent energy savings and using energy in a targeted way."
"I will be happy to talk to Parliament about this during the first quarter of next year when I will be able to submit to you our proposal for achieving a 20% improvement in energy efficiency."
"You mentioned the media."
"In fact, on the subject of renewable energy and consumers, more can be done by industry and investors, both investors in technology and financial investors."
"I have a proposal for you."
"I am planning to visit the three Baltic States next spring."
"I will be happy to attend a conference of representatives of the media, the banks and business, if you can suggest suitable candidates, in order to increase awareness in your country, using my modest resources, and to open up opportunities for new programmes and cofinancing."
"The next question was: What do I think of a European energy network?"
"I want to answer this very openly."
"If you look at the transport infrastructure in Europe, we have roads, motorways, railways, the European airspace, with its large and small regional airports, and major ports, such as Genoa, Marseilles, Hamburg and Rotterdam."
"There are also terminals for liquid natural gas and for oil in the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, the Baltic, the North Sea and the Atlantic."
"In addition, we have a digital infrastructure for information, communications and navigation, including our mobile phone network."
"In comparison to these areas, our energy networks are lagging far behind."
"We can transport televisions, pig carcasses, tinned foods and other goods from Portugal to Latvia and from Holland to Greece, we can transport workers and tourists and we can transfer information and financial services, but our gas and electricity networks are still divided up along the lines of 19th century principalities."
"We need to integrate the markets in the Baltic States, Finland, central Europe and Greece, before Serbia and Croatia join the European Union."
"We also need bridges and interconnectors to transport electricity in both directions between Spain, France and Germany."
"Over the next 20 years, we must put in place the financing and the legislation to ensure that our transport networks for electricity and gas are of the same quality and have the same capacity as our road and rail networks and our airspace, which can be used to transport goods and give people freedom of movement."
"Otherwise, we will not have security of supply or be able to show solidarity in an emergency."
"We will not be in a position to exchange storage capacity or establish renewable energy facilities in the best locations and bring the electricity to the centres of population."
"In addition, we will not have the competition which consumers want or be able to establish an internal market, which has always been one of the basic principles of the European Union and which must become a reality for gas and electricity."
"For this reason, I strongly support a major initiative to develop the transport networks for electricity, gas and oil."
"Subject: Structural Funds and disability"
"Many reports on the use of the Structural Funds show that, even if resources reach those who need them most, this is not done in the manner that would be most beneficial for them or in such a way as to bring about a genuine improvement in the quality of their lives."
"How does the Commission plan to prevent the Structural Funds being used to finance the institutionalisation of people with disabilities?"
"How does it plan to encourage their use to finance community-based alternatives to institutional care and promote the social inclusion of people with disabilities?"
"Member of the Commission. - As you are aware, social policy, including policy relating to people with disabilities, is primarily a national responsibility."
"However, stepping up support for disadvantaged groups and, in particular, for people with disabilities, including people living in institutions, is a key strand for action under the European Social Fund."
"According to some estimates, people with disabilities account for at least 16% of the EU working age population, but only 40% of people with disabilities are employed."
"The Commission encourages a shift from institutional to community-based care and is working closely with the Member States and, in particular, the managing authorities of the ESF and the ERDF and NGOs in this field."
"In 2009, the Commission published a report by an ad hoc expert group on the switchover from institutional to community-based care."
"In line with the principle of shared management, the Member States are responsible for selecting operations for financing under the structural funds."
"In the current programming period, the European Social and Regional Development Funds are supporting some de-institutionalisation schemes and the switch-over from residential care to community-based services."
"This is particularly true in certain Member States that joined the EU after 2004."
"Thus, projects are being financed in Bulgaria and Slovakia."
"As you know, the Commission is currently working on new provisions on the structural funds for the post-2013 period and will put forward proposals in 2011."
"To step up the fight against discrimination and promote social inclusion of people with disabilities, future operational programmes may, for example, be required to identify the groups at risk of discrimination and exclusion."
"The Commission will explore the role that national equality bodies could play and may consider stricter requirements on Member States' reporting of measures to combat discrimination, implemented with support from the structural funds."
"In addition, one of the aims of the European Disability Strategy for 2010 to 2020, which the Commission adopted on 15 November, is to give impetus to Member States' efforts to ease the transition from institutional to community-based care."
"The strategy seeks to do this by identifying good practice in using the structural funds to encourage people to live independently and in the community and aims to develop awareness-raising initiatives that target structural fund managing bodies at EU and national level."
"For example, a toolkit on how to use the structural funds to support the development of community-based services will be developed for the managing authorities."
"(HU) Mr President, indeed, it was this issue that I wished to pose further questions about and comment on."
"I was pleased to hear the Commissioner's answer."
"In fact, my supplementary question is whether, on the basis of these principles, the Commission plans to introduce a kind of new conditionality in the next budget period that prevents the strengthening of segregation but allows, say, the use of these funds to target social integration specifically."
"The problem was that these funds were often used for building and rebuilding large institutions rather than for integrated housing."
"I believe there are many good experts who will willingly help the Commission as well as the Member States in this."
"(LT) Thank you for your answer, Commissioner."
"I would like to congratulate the European Commission which earlier this month presented the new European Disability Strategy 2010-2020."
"However, I have the following question."
"What specific programmes does the Commission plan to prepare on the basis of this strategy and when, so that there are more favourable conditions for disabled people to enter the labour market, or so that their environment and infrastructure are adapted for them?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Belgian Presidency held a conference in LiÃ¨ge about the future of cohesion policies on the basis of the Fifth Cohesion Report, which we jointly published with Commissioner Hahn."
"Conditionality was one of the main discussion points and, as regards the European Social Fund, the situation described by Mrs GÃ¶ncz is being covered, and we would like to develop conditionality in that sense."
"Conditionality has various meanings and, unfortunately, some of these are seen as unfair or counterproductive."
"We believe that the real meaning of conditionality, as regards the structural funds, is that awareness and responsibility have to be raised not just as regards the content, but also the context of the projects and the operational programmes."
"We really have to connect with the social reality when we fund programmes in various regions and microregions, and we will take this very seriously."
"We have been working recently with some Member States on community-based services."
"For example, in Bulgaria, a joint project was financed by the European Social and Regional Development Fund to close down institutions for children with disabilities, as a first step in implementing an ambitious action plan to close down all existing institutions for children and providing family-type care and new services to support families."
"This particular programme was in the range of EUR 39 million but there are also similar ones not only in Bulgaria, but also in Slovakia."
"Subject: Anglo Irish Bank"
"Commissioner Almunia in a statement on the Irish financial sector said that there were 'a number of important aspects that still needed to be clarified' in relation to Anglo Irish Bank."
"Will the Commission explain what these important issues are?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, when Mr Mitchell tabled these questions on 7 October, the situation was not the same as it is today in Ireland and in the Irish banking sector."
"My answer will take into account what has happened since this question was asked."
"Seven days before your question was tabled, on 30 September, the Irish Finance Minister, Mr Lenihan, discussed the total cost of the restructuring of the Anglo Irish Bank, giving two possible figures: a mid-range estimate of EUR 29 billion and a higher estimate of EUR 34 billion."
"At the time, total capital injections from public funds to Anglo Irish amounted to around EUR 23 billion."
"As always, since the beginning of this crisis, according to our banking and restructuring information, when financial institutions receive injections of public capital, they have to present a restructuring plan to the Commission."
"Following much discussion on Anglo Irish, this restructuring plan was presented by the Irish Government on 26 October."
"In this draft restructuring plan, they considered a winding-down scenario for Anglo Irish proposing the split of Anglo into two banks - an asset recovery bank to wind down the assets of the bank and a funding bank to get the resources needed to keep it running during the process of winding down its assets."
"A scenario in which assets are wound down is less problematic than one in which the bank continues to operate, both in terms of State aid rules and competition."
"Consequently, I made some public statements saying that, in our opinion, the task was therefore not as difficult as negotiations concerning certain restructuring plans for other financial institutions in many Member States."
"We had been working on this draft restructuring plan from the time the government presented us with the document until last Sunday, when the Irish Government decided to ask for a programme making use of the different mechanisms to support Member States in the euro area with financial difficulties."
"Now, due account should be paid to the restructuring plan for Anglo in the ongoing negotiations on this programme."
"Hopefully, the Irish programme will be agreed and adopted in the coming days."
"I very much hope so."
"In this framework, I can give you some more precise answers on the Anglo Irish Bank restructuring plan presented by the Irish Government that will be considered by my services pending a decision."
"I hope this will take place as soon as possible after the adoption of the programme."
"In any case, I must say that I very much hope that the adoption and implementation of the programme will lead to a more favourable climate for tackling Ireland's financial and economic problems."
"Hopefully, the sound and strong fundamentals of the Irish economy will receive very good treatment, taking into account the need to restructure the financial sector that is the origin of the problems in your country."
"I thank the Commissioner for that response."
"This word 'restructuring' is being bandied about a lot outside the House."
"Could the Commissioner tell the House if he sees any possibility for a takeover or merger of part of Anglo Irish Bank with any other entity as a possible contribution to this, or does he anticipate that the bank will eventually be wound down?"
"In that case, will the Irish taxpayers get some, or all, of their money back?"
"What is the Commissioner's view on that?"
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for this information."
"However, my question is about a slightly different matter."
"You were speaking, Commissioner, about a very large bank - about Anglo Irish Bank - but information which has reached us indicates that other large banks in Ireland are also having problems."
"Could you tell us if similar negotiations are also under way concerning other banks in Ireland?"
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his answer as well."
"With regard to the specific issue of Anglo, is it the view of the Commission that Anglo is different to the existing clearing banks, as we call them in Ireland, like Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and so on?"
"Secondly, with regard to the clarification that he was talking about, is this also linked into the proposal coming forward from the government in Ireland tomorrow with regard to the banking finance facility which is being discussed with the IMF and with the European Central Bank?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Unfortunately, given that the negotiations on the programme that has been requested are ongoing during these days and hours, I cannot go into details."
"What I can tell Mr Mitchell is that these restructuring plans for the financial institutions in Ireland, and in general, the programme to finance the financial needs of Ireland at these difficult times, will hopefully have the positive outcome of putting an end to this very difficult and challenging situation in order to put the Irish economy back on the path of recovery and sustainable growth, as was the case in the past."
"Ireland was one of the best examples of economic success in the euro area and in the EU."
"This is the way to tell Irish taxpayers that their money which is now being used for this restructuring, together with financing that hopefully will come after the adoption of the programme from the two European mechanisms, plus the IMF cooperation in this programme, will be returned to them as the positive result of a successful solution to the present Irish problem."
"I cannot go into the details."
"I also ask for your understanding on this."
"What I can say is that there are other financial institutions, other Irish financial institutions, under the restructuring plans being negotiated, or that have been analysed by the Commission."
"You have seen our State aid rules competences."
"In the case of Bank of Ireland, we adopted a positive decision on the restructuring plan."
"In the case of the Allied Irish Bank, we are also negotiating the conditions of the restructuring plan."
"In the case of two building societies, EBS and INBS, we are also considering the restructuring of these financial institutions."
"I have to say that in two cases, the Anglo Irish Bank and the INBS building society, we are working on a winding-down scenario."
"In the other cases, the restructuring will hopefully put those financial institutions in the market in better conditions, in viable conditions, after their restructuring is decided and implemented."
"Subject: Creating a common European conscience"
"The creation of a common European conscience among EU citizens is vital if the enterprise of European unification is to survive."
"Given that mobility among those working in the cultural and arts sectors is the most effective way of forging a common European identity, what specific measures will the Commission take to encourage exchanges of experience and knowledge among European artists, establish a funding programme solely for artistic events in the EU and promote the administrative streamlining and financial support of cross-border artistic cooperation programmes?"
"Mr President, the Commission agrees completely with the honourable Member as regards the huge importance of cross-border mobility of those working in the cultural and arts sectors."
"We, too, are making efforts to eliminate obstacles to their mobility."
"These efforts include coordination of social security, passport visa rules for artists from third countries, taxation and, of course, better information on mobility issues."
"Experts in the cultural sector are debating how to promote mobility, in working parties where the Member States and the cultural sector are represented, with a view to applying the objectives of the European Agenda for Culture."
"Under the Culture programme (2007-2013), the Commission is supporting projects and activities which promote cross-border mobility of those working in the cultural sector, encourage the transnational circulation of artistic and cultural works and foster intercultural dialogue."
"In 2009, approximately 80% of the projects funded by the Commission focused on the circulation of cultural works and the mobility of those working in the cultural sector."
"Of course, the Commission is still making an effort, as I said, to facilitate access to the programme."
"The programme guide, the calendar, which is for the period 2008 to 2013, good examples of projects and the cultural contact points in each country all help to simplify access."
"The experience acquired to date will be useful in developing procedures for future culture programmes."
"Following an initiative passed by Parliament, the Commission also applied pilot projects to encourage mobility of artists, both in 2008 and 2009."
"The aim of these projects is to give European artists a chance to extend the scope of their activities and to reach a new public, as well as to exchange experiences and learn from each other in order to further their career."
"The results of these pilot projects will be input into future culture programmes and are, of course, of help to the working parties of Member State experts within the framework of the open method of coordination."
"In the long term, everything I have just mentioned will help to forge a common European conscience among the citizens of the European Union."
"(EL) Mr President, my thanks to the Commissioner for her detailed reply."
"On the European cultural weather map, the clouds of de-unification are gathering, as we all know."
"There is the Europe of numbers, the technical Europe, but there are also those of us who envisage a Europe of culture, of education, of art, of mobility of artists, of encouragement for cross-European cultural creation."
"I am one of those who believe that these are the foundations, the cultural foundations of Europe, and can act as a secure, stabilising factor for further dynamic support for the process of European unification."
"Give culture and artistic creation impetus and as a percentage - to waive my own rule for a moment and talk in numbers - let us increase the contribution to European GDP via culture and artistic creation."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for this interesting information, but my question and my concern are related to the budgetary situation."
"We are well aware that we are, today, in an uncertain situation as to what budget will be available next year."
"In relation to this, I would like to ask you, Commissioner, if these problems might in any specific way affect the very interesting plans which you have presented?"
"Mr President, may I start by saying to Mr Papastamkos that I absolutely agree with him."
"I attended a huge 'Soul for Europe' forum in Berlin a few days ago, which was also attended by representatives of all the cultural agencies."
"We discussed these issues and said that Europe is not just an economic Union; it starts with culture."
"As Jean Monnet says in his memoirs, 'if I could start again, I would start with culture'."
"So I absolutely agree and the efforts we are making are in this direction."
"I agree with you, but I fear, like everybody else, that governments, when they start cutting budgets in times of austerity, start with the obvious: culture - as we have seen already in certain cases - education and health."
"I agree it is a very narrow-minded policy and we should oppose it because, in the long run, we shall all feel the repercussions of such cuts."
"Subject: Structured dialogue between the EU and sporting federations on matters of shared interest and possible specific measures"
"Following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon and the recognition of the special nature of sport, the way is now open for giving sport a truly European dimension."
"New provisions allow the European Union to support, coordinate and integrate the actions of the Member States, promoting fairness and openness in sporting competitions and cooperation between bodies responsible for sports."
"The treaty also recognises the importance of protecting the physical and moral integrity of sportspeople, especially young people."
"In the light of the treaty provisions, what steps does the Commission expect international sporting federations to take with a view to launching an ever more fruitful dialogue on matters of shared interest?"
"What specific measures will the Commission take to support this dialogue and to make full use of the powers relating to sport laid down in the treaty?"
"Member of the Commission. - In 2007, the Commission set up a structured dialogue with sports stakeholders on the basis of the 2007 White Paper on sport."
"Following calls from EU sports ministers and the European Council in 2008, the Commission committed itself to further strengthening the dialogue and to giving international sports organisations a more prominent place in the dialogue with the European Union."
"This has led to regular exchanges between the Commission and the International Olympic Committee and international sports federations."
"In 2008, the Commission established the EU Sport Forum."
"This is considered to be at the heart of this structured dialogue, gathering together once a year all key sports stakeholders at international, European and national level, including governing bodies as well as non-governmental sports organisations."
"The next forum will take place in February 2011 in Budapest, where the Commission intends to present its communication on a new EU sports agenda to sports stakeholders."
"The Commission has paid great attention to the need to ensure a balanced and inclusive representation of the sports movement when organising meetings and events."
"It is committed to this dialogue, taking into account the specific organisation of sport, the complexity of topics to be addressed and, of course, the diversity of sports actors."
"The reinforcement of this structured dialogue with the sports movement will be essential for the success of the EU agenda for sport, which the Commission intends to propose, based on the Lisbon Treaty."
"Within this strengthened dialogue, Member States, Parliament and the Commission should all have their place."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon and the recognition of the special nature of sport, the way is now open for giving sport a truly European dimension."
"New provisions allow the European Union to support, coordinate and integrate the actions of the Member States, promoting fairness and openness in sporting competitions and cooperation between bodies responsible for sports."
"The treaty also recognises the importance of protecting the physical and moral integrity of sportspeople, especially young people."
"In the light of the treaty provisions, what steps does the Commission expect international sporting federations to take with a view to launching an ever more fruitful dialogue on matters of shared interest?"
"What specific measures will the Commission take to support this dialogue and to make full use of the powers relating to sport laid down in the treaty?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened very attentively to the Commission's response."
"I would like to ask the Commission about its stance on illegal betting, the illicit bets that are such a feature of football and other sports competitions, and if it intends, as part of the programme we have just heard described, to devote special attention to this aspect, which risks blighting every competition and spoiling the fairness that should characterise sporting competitions."
"Member of the Commission. - Let me start with the last question."
"Commissioner Barnier is dealing with this question."
"Of course, I will follow very closely what he does."
"I understand he is going to present a Green Paper in 2011 in order to start the consultation on this very important issue."
"I assure you that because of my interest in my portfolio, I will follow what happens very closely."
"As I said in my introduction, I am going to present a communication on sport."
"It will be the first ever communication presenting the political agenda on sport - hopefully at the beginning of January - and all the issues mentioned by the honourable Member will be discussed in this communication."
"The first presentation and discussion will take place, as I said, during the structured dialogue in the context of the sport forum in Budapest next February."
"Subject: Tax burden in Greece"
"By signing the memorandum of understanding, Greece has placed itself at the forefront in Europe when it comes to basic taxation, with the result that Greece now has the third highest rate of VAT, the third highest tax on fuel, the third highest rate of social security contributions and one of the highest rates of business taxation and nominal taxes."
"The imposition of this tax burden in Greece, combined with parallel cuts in salaries and pensions, is not leading to the anticipated increase in revenue. On the contrary, it is worsening the recession and stifling the market, increasing the level of poverty, particularly with regard to basic needs, making it difficult for wage earners and pensioners to meet their living expenses and leading to the closure of hundreds of businesses."
"Given that the EU's objective is to guarantee both fiscal consolidation and social adequacy, how does the Commission, as a party to the memorandum of understanding, assess the above fiscal measures?"
"Member of the Commission. - As the honourable Member is aware, Greece has introduced a number of tax policy measures to reduce its deficit."
"This economic adjustment programme was agreed with the Commission, the IMF and the ECB."
"It conditioned the EUR 110 billion financing that is being provided by the euro area Member States and the IMF."
"On 6 August 2010, a report was submitted by the Greek Government to the Council and the Commission discussing the implementation of those tax measures, as well as of wide-ranging structural reforms."
"The honourable Member can refer to the communication from the Commission to the Council of 19 August 2010 for a detailed and thorough assessment of the measures adopted in the first half of 2010 by Greece to comply with Council Decision 2010/320/EC of 10 May 2010."
"This assessment mainly concludes that the budgetary execution shows positive developments over the first half of 2010 with a deficit declining faster than planned, mainly as a result of lower than expected expenditure."
"Moreover, within the framework of the planned fiscal adjustment, the choice of the mix between expenditure and revenue measures made by the Greek Government takes into account important social and economic aspects, in particular, in terms of potential complementarities with a package of structural reforms and measures to improve the micro-economic environment and the functioning of the public sector."
"(EL) Commissioner, I should like to ask the European Commission the following supplementary question: as a party to the memorandum, what recommendations does it intend to make to Greece, bearing in mind that the current high level of taxation has already resulted in the closure or relocation of businesses to other, more tax-lenient, neighbouring countries and, at the same time, in a reduction in incoming investment capital, the return on capital and entrepreneurship in general."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to come back to an issue raised in my honourable friend's question."
"With the increase and the tax policy being applied by the government based on the memorandum, inflation has rocketed in Greece and is now over 6%, the highest rate in Europe."
"Mr Rehn agreed, in answer to a question, that high inflation is due to the increase in the VAT rate, in other words, to fiscal policy."
"I would like to ask you if the Commission believes that these tax measures really have led to the spiralling inflation that is undermining the competitiveness of the Greek economy and what measures you are proposing to the Greek Government to address this issue."
"Member of the Commission. - Actually, the questions are rather similar and here I have to emphasise that in the case of Greece, we had a huge deficit which needed to be addressed."
"We all know that, in addressing the deficit, there are no miracle solutions."
"The Member State has either to reduce expenditure, increase taxes or both in order to consolidate its fiscal position."
"The Commission's attitude to this is very clear: that it is the Member State which has to choose the measures to address the shortfall."
"Greece chose a mixture of measures on both the expenditure side and the revenue side."
"The Commission cannot dictate to the Member States what specific taxes they can increase or reduce."
"It is the Member State which decides on this matter."
"So far, the Greek programme is functioning well and I believe that the Greek authorities will take all necessary future measures to fix their fiscal position."
"Subject: Fraud and customs losses due to cigarette smuggling"
"Is the Commission concerned that there is an alarming level of smuggling of illegal cigarettes into countries like Ireland from third countries?"
"The effect of this is that the EU is losing out on customs revenue, which is an important source of finance, given that it makes up 15% of the EU budget."
"Member States are also losing out on excise duties."
"Does the Commission have any plans to enable, or indeed force, Member States to increase their checks at external EU borders, in order to tackle the issue of customs fraud?"
"Member of the Commission. - In relation to border controls, customs controls must balance the protection of a range of EU financial, safety and security interests with the interests of legitimate traders."
"For this reason, a Community risk management framework was developed enabling customs controls for security and safety to be carried out on the basis of common risk criteria and standards."
"In the EU, 1.5 million tonnes of sea cargo and 12 million tonnes of air cargo are checked each year."
"Under Article 209(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Member States' customs services are responsible for the application of the EU legislation concerned."
"Therefore, they are in charge of organising customs controls at physical frontiers and elsewhere on the basis of risk management techniques as specified in the EU's Customs Code."
"With regard to cigarette smuggling, the Commission plays an active role in helping Member States to tackle the phenomenon of international cigarette smuggling and to dismantle the criminal gangs responsible for this trade."
"In particular, the European Anti-Fraud Office assists law enforcement authorities throughout the European Union with their operational cases and coordinates major customs and criminal investigations with the Member States and third countries."
"Using the provisions of European mutual assistance in customs matters and a number of agreements concluded between the EU and third countries, OLAF organises joint customs operations between EU Member States and with third countries aimed at targeting specific problems, such as Operation Matthew II, targeting road traffic on the eastern border, or Operation Sirocco, focused on deep-sea container transports from China to the Union."
"Finally, OLAF provides financial support to Member States from the Hercule II programme for measures specifically targeting cigarette smuggling, such as the purchase of specialist x-ray scanning equipment to be used at border points and the organisation of regional actions."
"Moreover, cooperation agreements were signed with British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco Limited in 2010, and agreements were signed with Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International in 2004 and 2007 respectively."
"These legally binding agreements provide a comprehensive set of measures designed to limit the presence of the products of these companies on the illicit tobacco market."
"I want to thank the Commissioner for his very comprehensive reply."
"As he said, tobacco smuggling is a very lucrative business."
"There is a lot of ingenuity, they are perfectly wrapped, perfectly presented and perfectly labelled."
"Recently, I met with the head of the customs authorities in Ireland in Dublin Castle, and she told me that one in every five cigarettes - 20% of the cigarettes smoked in Ireland, a small country - actually comes via China, and that when they actually seized them and analysed them, they found a mixture of tobacco and canine excrement."
"We really need to tighten up our regulations."
"I welcome international cooperation, but we still have an awful lot of work to do."
"I would basically ask that OLAF, the EU anti-fraud agency, needs to be given increased resources."
"Member of the Commission. - I will try to be very brief."
"The answer in this case is probably not needed, but I would like to share your concerns."
"Next month, I am going to China to discuss, among other issues related to customs matters, the issue of cigarette smuggling."
"We are implementing a number of measures, working together with the Chinese authorities, in order to address this issue."
"It is true, as you rightly pointed out, that China is still a major source of counterfeited cigarettes, so we have to work in close cooperation with them in order to tackle this issue."
"I have to emphasise that the Chinese authorities are ready for this cooperation."
"Subject: Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base"
"Can the Commission say what its current proposals are on the adoption of a common consolidated corporate tax base, indicate a proposed timeframe and outline its reasons for pursuing this policy?"
"Subject: Ireland's corporation tax rate"
"There is a considerable amount of speculation ongoing in international media so it would provide a welcome signal to international markets in a time of crisis that this key element of Ireland's economic model will not be affected in any way by any proposal by the Commission."
"Can the Commission outline clearly and unequivocally that the EU will not bring forward any measures that have any influence on Ireland's corporation tax rate?"
"Subject: Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB)"
"Can the Commission make a statement confirming that the proposed CCCTB initiative will not impact upon the ability of Member States to set their individual corporation tax rate?"
"Member of the Commission. - Do you mean these three questions on the CCCTB?"
"The Commission has no plans to make proposals on corporate tax rates."
"Differences in rates allow a certain degree of tax competition to be maintained in the internal market."
"In addition, fair tax competition based on rates offers more transparency and allows Member States to consider both their market competitiveness and budgetary needs in fixing their tax rates."
"In relation to the issue of corporate tax bases, conversely, the Commission has been working for some time on a proposal for a common consolidated corporate tax base."
"This initiative is included in the Commission work programme for 2011 as a strategic initiative to tap the potential of the single market for growth."
"It is also quoted as a key proposal in the Single Market Act, which was adopted on 27 October 2010."
"Currently, the Commission's plan is to adopt a proposal by the end of the first quarter of 2011."
"The CCCTB is a common system of rules for calculating the tax base of companies; it has no bearing on tax rates."
"Member States will continue to decide their own corporate tax rates."
"The Commission believes that progressing with the CCCTB is the appropriate solution to tackling cross-border fiscal impediments to growth in a comprehensive manner."
"Currently, the existence of 27 highly disparate corporate tax systems in the EU means that companies are faced with significant tax obstacles and an administrative burden which discourage, if not impede, their activities in the single market and negatively affect their competitiveness, in particular, in the case of SMEs."
"Such a highly fragmented landscape gives rise to significant market distortions and barriers and creates considerable compliance costs."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply."
"I understand perfectly what he says about the difference between tax rates and tax bases, but one of the issues for companies - particularly for foreign direct investment coming into Europe - is the ability for those companies to know in advance, with certainty, the tax implications of a transaction."
"If part of that calculation is sales by destination, that cannot be determined beforehand, so there is real uncertainty for those companies."
"I think that acts as a disincentive for foreign direct investment."
"I have many other questions but I know we are tight on time so, if the Commissioner could answer that one, I would be happy."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive response but also ask him if he could acknowledge that the Lisbon Treaty includes a detailed protocol with respect to taxation and a Member State's right to veto tax proposals."
"Member of the Commission. - We can disagree on certain principles of taxation, which is always a rather sensitive matter."
"The biggest support for the CCCTB comes from businesses; we have clear evidence of this."
"I understand this because, when dealing with 27 different Member States with 27 different corporate tax systems, it is really a mess for them."
"Concerning foreign direct investment, if we are able to agree on this proposal, we have to do so unanimously."
"If we are able to agree, this will facilitate foreign direct investment because foreign investors who want to invest, not in one Member State but in several, will be able to deal with one corporate tax system instead of several corporate tax systems, and that is a big advantage for foreign investors."
"Throughout bilateral discussions with potential investors, they really emphasise the issue of 27 corporate tax systems as an impediment to facilitating foreign direct investment."
"Finally, when we are talking about the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, we are not talking about tax rates."
"It is clear that this has nothing to do with the sovereignty of Member States in deciding tax matters because, even within the CCCTB environment, they will be able to decide on corporate tax rates, based on their needs, their social systems, public services and so on. So the proposal itself does not reduce the sovereignty of Member States in tax matters."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 20:35 and resumed at 21:00)"
"Measures to be taken to free Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo (debate)"
"The next item is the statements on measures to be taken to free Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo."
"Madam President, honourable Members - if I have understood correctly this time - it is on behalf of Lady Ashton, our High Representative, that I have the honour of taking the floor before you."
"The European Union continues to monitor on a daily basis, through its delegation in Beijing and its bilateral embassies, the situation with respect to Mr Liu Xiaobo, Nobel Peace Prize winner, his wife Liu Xia, as well as their friends and lawyers."
"Their situation is receiving our constant attention."
"The house arrest that Mrs Liu Xia and many human rights activists in China have been under since 8 October worries us as much as it disappoints us, and we condemn it."
"As you know, the European Union has not waited for Mr Liu Xiaobo to receive this prestigious award to remind the Chinese Government of its international commitments regarding respect for freedom of expression."
"In this particular case, the European Union has always considered that Charter 08 was a peaceful manifesto, calling for more respect for human rights in China."
"What is more, the Union has published four public declarations since December 2008, calling for Liu Xiaobo to be released."
"Our position could not be any different when the Nobel Committee announced on 8 October, entirely independently need I point out, its decision."
"We have congratulated Liu Xiaobo via the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs, Lady Ashton, and via the President of the European Commission, JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, and we have stressed how important his release is to us."
"We regret that the Chinese authorities have not heeded the calls that the international community has been eager to amplify."
"It is regrettable that the European Union should take note, once again and with concern, of the intimidation and house arrest that Mr Liu Xiaobo's wife, Mrs Liu Xia, has been subjected to for the last six weeks."
"We deplore just as vigorously the threats, surveillance and ban on leaving the country, as well as the arrests that many of Liu Xiaobo's relatives and friends have been subjected to since he was awarded the Nobel Prize."
"Madam President, the European Union will continue with consistency and determination the efforts that it has undertaken for nearly two years now to see Liu Xiaobo freed so that he can exercise his rights in full and take part, as he would like to, in the public debate that he initiated in China with Charter 08."
"We carry on hoping that he will be able to collect the Nobel Peace Prize in person on 10 December."
"We call on China to remove the restrictions on freedom of movement and of expression to which his wife Liu Xia and many of his friends are subjected."
"Madam President, Minister, honourable Members, the Commission fully supports the Belgian Presidency's statement."
"The European Union has repeatedly maintained that it considers Charter 08 to be a legitimate exercise of freedom of expression and, as the Presidency has just noted, the European Union has reiterated several times the serious concerns it has about Liu Xiaobo's arrest, trial and imprisonment."
"Both President Barroso and the Vice-President of the Commission and EU High Representative, Cathy Ashton, have welcomed the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo on 8 October."
"However, the Commission regrets the fact that the Chinese authorities have reacted by putting his wife, Mrs Liu Xia, under house arrest, and by restricting freedom of movement for many of his friends."
"The Commission reiterates its call on China to release Liu Xiaobo immediately from prison and to lift his wife's house arrest order, as well as to remove all restrictions on his friends' freedom of movement."
"The Commission, as mentioned by the Vice-President of the Commission and EU High Representative, Cathy Ashton, in her statement, hopes that Liu Xiaobo will be able to collect the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize in person, in Oslo."
"Madam President, ten months ago in this House, I was saying that the 11-year prison sentence given to Liu Xiaobo by the Chinese Government simply for expressing his views was symptomatic of the Chinese authorities stepping up their campaign against human rights activists."
"At this very moment, I believe that awarding the Nobel Prize to Liu Xiaobo is an appropriate act to emphasise that, although China has made great progress in economic and sometimes in social matters, the real sign of progress is respect for human rights."
"A country can be admired for its economic achievements. However, it will not gain the respect of other countries if it restricts freedom instead of protecting it."
"Indeed, I find the actions taken by the Chinese Government in an attempt to intimidate the countries invited to attend the ceremony extremely worrying."
"It is just as worrying that some countries have given in to this blackmail."
"We are dealing with an unacceptable situation because a country is taking a stance in its international relations against one of its own citizens."
"In fact, China would gain, as I was saying, the respect of the other countries if it allowed Liu Xiaobo now to go to Oslo to receive his prize instead of making these threats against other countries."
"However, the Chinese authorities' attitude seems, for the time being, to be much more hard line than that of the Soviets because not even a member of Liu Xiaobo's family or his lawyer is able to get to Oslo."
"This is why I welcome the initiative proposed by Lech WaÅÄsa to represent the Chinese dissident symbolically in Oslo."
"However, I hope that the Chinese authorities will decide at the last moment to release Liu Xiaobo."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, tonight, we in the Socialist and Democrat Group give our full support to this European Parliament demand that Liu Xiaobo is allowed to go to Oslo, and does not earn a different prize as the first laureate or laureate's representative in its one hundred year history to be unable to be present to receive the Nobel Peace Prize."
"Arrested for taking part in demonstrations, banned from teaching, sent for re-education and now imprisoned for seeking to exercise freedom of expression, the Chinese called Liu Xiaobo a criminal whilst the rest of the world awards him the accolade for peace."
"I went to China personally on behalf of this House and saw that there are people ready to enter into dialogue with us on issues of labour rights and corporate social responsibility."
"But the fact remains that, when this Parliament's Human Rights Subcommittee sought visas from China, no reply was ever given; and when the EU pressed for a meeting of our human rights dialogue with China, the Chinese deliberately offered a date between Christmas this year and the New Year."
