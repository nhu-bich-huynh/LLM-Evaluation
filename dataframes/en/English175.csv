"Text"
"It is a shame that these proposals should be so weak, but I shall come back to that in a few moments."
"Secondly, the rapporteur rightly drew our attention to the fact that 40 % of waste is the result of do-it-yourself - people working on their homes at the weekend."
"Perhaps we should envisage a measure which would promote the use of low solvent-content paints, or at least less harmful solvents, involving, for example, the introduction of an eco-tax."
"My third comment is that the Commission's text also raises the question of the costs of the operation, which are enormous."
"However, little is said about health expenses."
"I would like to give a figure."
"On consulting recent literature, I realized that in most European countries, constant franc expenses on health have increased by a factor of 3.5 over 25 years."
"This is enormous, because the level of health is by no means clearly better than twenty-five years ago."
"Consequently, and here there is no real risk of getting things wrong, we can say that the damage caused by environmental pollution is increasingly having an adverse effect on the health of Europeans. This is ample justification for emergency measures."
"I would like to make my last comment in the form of a question to the Commissioner, Mrs Bjerregaard."
"It would appear that the Council has already decided on its common position. This is rather surprising, as Parliament is now in the process of a debate."
"Is that true?"
"If the answer is yes, the present debate would itself be a surprising event."
"Mr President, I would also like to thank Mr Cabrol for his excellent work, and I would primarily like to go into an issue a number of my colleagues have already discussed, namely the effects of thinners on employees who work with them."
"As far as we know, they are used in approximately twenty economic sectors, including the chemical industry, decorating businesses, the metal industry, printing and allied trades, even food, stimulants, and textile industries."
"Exposure to these chemicals can lead to tiredness, nausea, palpitations, and other symptoms. Long-term exposure can lead to irreversible damage to the nervous system, which can manifest itself as forgetfulness, concentration disorders and even loss of identity - in other words, the organic psychosyndrome, OPS."
"In the autumn of 1997, the Dutch Government took measures to protect employees in some of the sectors where thinners are used."
"In other Member States, namely Sweden, Denmark and Finland, clear legislation for the protection of employees also exists."
"Since the introduction of this legislation the number of OPS victims has decreased in these countries in particular."
"In some countries OPS is recognized as an occupational illness, but in other Member States no attention is given to OPS."
"That is why we amended this directive."
"In fact, I submitted a number of these amendments myself, and I am delighted that they have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"I therefore think that the protection of these OPS victims will have to be incorporated into the Commission's proposal, which deals with public health, but in which this element does not feature at all."
"It is an opportunity that the Commission has to grasp now, in anticipation of what the Commission has yet to do between 1999 and 2003, a common programme for the illnesses related to pollution, I understand."
"I also hope that the Commissioner can respond to our amendments, and I would be grateful if she could give a reply."
"Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, and especially their rapporteurs, Mr Cabrol and Mr RÃ¼big, for the very thorough work on the preparation of this complicated proposal."
"What is said is correct: this is a very important proposal, but it is also a very technical proposal."
"The main purpose of the directive is to reduce VOC emissions from a long list of industrial activities in which solvents are used."
"The emissions of many of the VOCs, as has also been emphasized in the debate here, are directly harmful to human health and should therefore be reduced as much as is technically possible."
"The solvents are used, as we have heard, in paints, for cleaning, in the printing industry and for many other things. In all, 20 sectors are affected."
"For most sectors, the requirements consist of emission limits and limits on diffuse emissions."
"However, businesses may be exempt from these requirements on condition that they achieve the same reduction in emissions in another way. For example, by replacing products with a high solvent content with products containing low levels of solvents, or none at all."
"And the proposal also allows Member States to achieve the same targets by methods which are best suited to their national conditions, and which are set out in a national plan."
"The Commission has considered the 32 amendments proposed by the Committee on the Environment, and the 15 new amendments proposed by Parliament."
"The result of this was that the Commission is able to accept 11 of these amendments either wholly or partly."
"The Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 4, 13, 15, 17, 18, 21, 25 and 31. It can accept Amendment No 23 in principle and Amendment No 26 in part."
"And, finally, it can partially approve Amendment No 37 (footnote 1). These amendments improve the text with additional background, sensible and logical additional requirements, the removal of possible misinterpretations, improved transparency and an increased level of protection."
"I shall not go into details for every one of these amendments, but I would like to give a reason for our attitude to some of them, and so explain the Commission's thinking."
"The Commission believes that the Member States should have a certain freedom of action with regard to how they achieve the directive's environmental objectives, which is something several of the speakers here this evening have touched on."
"Therefore we cannot support Amendments Nos 6, 19 and 22, which completely remove the possibility of making national plans."
"However, as Parliament is no doubt aware, the Council is flexible on reducing the scope of the national plans, and so the Commission can continue to work on that basis, and we will of course take it up in the continued procedure."
"Amendment No 16, concerning a duty to replace R40 substances with less harmful substances as soon as possible, is not supported by the Commission because R40 substances are not sufficiently dangerous to require such measures."
"The Commission believes that the very strict emission limits which have been set out for these chemicals are a sufficient incentive to seek substitutes for R40 substances."
"Since the risk of occupational injury - a question which was raised by Mrs Jensen and Mrs van Putten among others - does not fall within the scope of this proposal, Amendment No 2 and Amendment No 20 cannot be accepted immediately."
"On the other hand, the Commission is going to arrange an exchange of information, and I think we should definitely consider using information about this important aspect in this exchange of information, and so Amendment No 17 is acceptable."
"Amendment No 7 is not acceptable because the Treaty already contains the necessary provisions to allow Member States to adopt more stringent requirements."
"Most of the amendments concerning procedural aspects can be accepted, but two amendments propose that the approval procedure should only be used for plants covered by the IPPC directive."
"They are Amendments Nos 10 and 14."
"In line with the principle of subsidiarity, Member States should be able to decide freely which procedure - approval or registration - shall be followed in the case of non-IPPC plants."
"In two new comments the Commission is called upon to take supplementary initiatives."
"The first comment is Amendment No 8, in which Mr Eisma was involved among others, and it concerns the question of a directive on solvent containing products such as paints and DIY products."
"The Commission agrees that such an approach could be useful, and intends to set the preliminary work in motion this year."
"However, in our opinion it is too early to enter into any commitments before the investigations are complete."
"In the other comment, Amendment No 9, the Commission is called upon to examine how plants under the threshold values set in the directive can be regulated at the EU level."
"It is not the Commission's intention to supplement this proposal with further measures for small plants."
"The Commission has been particularly careful to ensure that unnecessary burdens are not placed on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Consequently, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 and 28-30, which introduce tougher emission limits or change the scope of the proposal."
"Amendments Nos 36, 37 (apart from footnote 1), 38, 42, 43, and 45-47 will either reduce the environmental protection planned in the proposal, or limit the scope of the proposal."
"Therefore these amendments cannot be supported by the Commission."
"The Commission is certain that its proposal, improved by the addition of many of Parliament's amendments, provides an effective and balanced basis for limiting the pollution of the troposphere by ozone."
"Thank you, Commissioner Bjerregaard."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Epidemiological surveillance"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0004/98), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position established by the Council (C4-0437/97-96/0052(COD)) with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Decision setting up a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the European Community (Rapporteur: Mr Cabrol.)"
"Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for his detailed explanation of the situation which faces us at the second reading, which I do not intend to duplicate tonight."
"Instead, with respect to the few diligent souls still left in the Public Gallery at this hour, I would like to illustrate in a way that is particularly relevant to Members why we need to make some real progress both tonight and in the coming weeks to create a meaningful European network for surveillance and control of communicable diseases."
"There is something that most Members do more often than most of our fellow citizens: we fly in aeroplanes."
"Put any two Members together and very soon they will start discussing departure lounges and airline schedules."
"We do not just fly around Europe, we often move through most of the corners of the globe."
"Throughout that globe there are some very risky places, and some of the risk for the unwary or the unprotected is caused by disease."
"The disease could be carried in the air, in liquids, bodies, articles or by insects."
"Yet in some of the European Union Member States, there are health rules at points of access, in others the rules are very different, despite frequent cross-border transits."
"On some airlines measures are taken to protect passengers - for example by spraying cabins - on others they are not."
"Information is made available in some states, sometimes accurately and accessibly and in a range of different languages based on a wide range of data."
"In such circumstances a close degree of cooperation and coordination makes common sense, not just for travellers and parliamentarians but for all our citizens who need protection in many more ways than the very simple small example I have just set out."
"However, the common position returned to this Parliament offers a number of low common denominators."
"While agreeing the surveillance network means obligations on Member States, the Council has agreed unanimously only a more general flexible framework for information exchange and coordination of efforts."
"Even allowing for Treaty limitations, there are severe concerns that this will be completely insufficient."
"After all, the poor status quo brought about these proposals after initial reports showed the weaknesses."
"Five years later we still need progress."
"Hence the strength of the near unanimous votes in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection for the recommendations of the rapporteur."
"Mr Cabrol has pursued his extra proposals with his usual vigour and diligence."
"It will be of great interest to see whether, assuming Parliament as a whole adopts the recommendation, as I hope it will, in the subsequent conciliation negotiations the minimal stance of the Council and the more progressive and realistic approach of the Commission - which I know places considerable importance on these proposals to the extent of unusually reserving its position - can be reconciled with the more forward-thinking proposals from this Parliament."
"It may be that some are too far ahead of their time, and specific European structures may have to await the lessons of the future reports which we will now receive at even more regular intervals than we suggested at first reading."
"I am pleased that at least some of our suggestions have already been incorporated."
"However, my group will be supporting the argument for a more clearly defined role for the European Union, which goes beyond a couple of officials keeping an eye on development of diseases within our boundaries, or simple supplementation of wider WHO or state networks which may or not be effectively implemented."
"The Commission wants the power to be proactive, to study and act upon significant outbreaks wherever they occur and, given the draft Treaty commitments on coherent public health policies across Europe, to take proper coherent action where and when it is needed."
"It needs to be sure of accurate, fast, comparable data and that there are no weak links in the chain."
"Finally, I hope the whole House will thank Mr Cabrol for pursuing his case."
"I now look forward to both the Council and the Commission negotiating seriously and urgently on all the amendments we support to help a meaningful, practical and effective network to be put in place, not to expand bureaucracy but to help tackle some of the worst diseases in the world."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all the political groups, in keeping with the position already assumed on the first reading, have declared their agreement, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, with Mr Cabrol's excellent report on the decision to set up a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community."
"As the rapporteur reminded us, the common position is unacceptable and, in fact, the Commission stated that it could not accept its current wording because the text proposed by Council does not have the necessary means to achieve the objective of this programme, which is to collect information on communicable diseases from surveillance networks in the Member States."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has adopted the 22 amendments proposed by the rapporteur almost unanimously, which gives us every hope for a strong and united commitment on the part of the Parliamentary delegation to the conciliation procedure upon which this report is inevitably embarking."
"As rapporteur on the health monitoring action programme which ended last year, I noted the Council's hard and short-sighted position on that occasion too. Real force had to be applied during conciliation at that time, because of the Council's opposition to the idea of conducting a feasibility study into setting up a permanent structure to act as a European health observatory, and because of the scant funding proposed."
"A central and permanent structure at European level for a network for the epidemiological surveillance of communicable diseases is essential in view of the outbreak of old and new epidemics, and in order to have a fast alarm system that enables Member States to take the necessary and properly coordinated measures."
"Unfortunately, Article 129 of the Treaty is contradictory, even in the new Amsterdam wording: on the one hand, in the first point it declares that it wants to ensure a high level of human health protection, but then, further on, the same Article prohibits any kind of harmonization of the laws and regulations of the Member States, thus eliminating the means for any incisive intervention."
"However, as we know, pathogens, microbes and viruses do not stop at state borders, and do not observe regulations."
"Nevertheless, the proposal made by the rapporteur, whom I congratulate on his clarity, commitment and decision, does not actually imply any amendment to the regulations, but only asks for a structure to be set up to collect available information on communicable diseases, to pass it on to the Member States for the better protection of the health of European citizens."
"For these reasons, the Group of the European People's Party will vote in favour of the amendments and the programme."
"Mr President, I am delighted that the Amsterdam Treaty on the future of the European Union states that the new provisions on public health protection will be introduced with particular focus on committing the European Union to improving the level of human health."
"This provision - Article 152 of the Amsterdam Treaty - is clearly a recognition that the European Union must introduce confidence-building measures in the field of public and human health, in the light of difficulties which arose as a result of the problems relating to BSE and blood-contaminated products in many European states in recent years."
"Indeed, Community action which complements national policies shall be directed towards improving public health, preventing human illness and diseases and obviating sources of danger to public health."
"Such action shall cover the fight against the major health scourges by improving research into the causes, their transmission and prevention, as well as health information and education."
"The Community shall complement the Member States' action in reducing drug-related health damage, including information and prevention."
"In particular, the European Union shall adopt measures setting out the highest standards for the quality and safety of organs and substances of human origin, blood and blood derivatives."
"However, European Union measures adopted in this sphere shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures on this subject."
"Finally, I am indeed pleased that the European Parliament has been given the power of codecision by the Amsterdam Treaty, with the European Council of Health Ministers, on all new proposals for European legislation in the area of public health and human health."
"I should like to compliment Mr Cabrol on his detailed and excellent report."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I should first like to say that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left fully supports Mr Cabrol's report. It is an excellent report, which has demonstrated profound and serious contradictions in this area, which is such an important part of the building of Europe."
"Now that we have the opportunity to implement Community policies, instruments and responses to problems suffered by the people of Europe, it is unthinkable that we should fail to take advantage of that opportunity, because of difficulties totally unrelated to the matter."
"Faced with a problem of this nature - the problem of the growing risk and increased incidence of all types of communicable disease emerging in Europe and elsewhere - we do not see how the Council and the Commission can fail to agree with Parliament, so that we can design appropriate Community instruments."
"Therefore, we do not understand why there has been reluctance expressed about this aspect of the building of the European Community, in these areas which do not present a great problem. In fact, both the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty of Amsterdam already recognize the European Union's competence in the area of public health."
"Therefore, we think efforts should be made to respond to the needs of the European public."
"Finally, I think it needs to be stressed that the European socioeconomic model is adding to the difficulties, by creating these problems both within Europe and elsewhere. It should also be revised, to create a model based on solidarity rather than competitiveness and inequality."
"Mr President, anyone involved with health knows that the best way to save financial resources and, obviously, human life is prevention."
"Prevention is not just a question of vaccines, but also requires health education, with information. Also however, and obviously particularly with regard to communicable diseases, it involves recognizing the danger in time and seeking to reduce its consequences."
"Curiously enough, the Council is not aware of this, preferring to save a bit of money today, making the Member States run the risk later of having to face an epidemic with possibly huge expenses."
"This is obviously very serious, particularly as we would once again miss the opportunity of providing Europe with the image (which is the only thing of interest to citizens) of a supranational organization that deals with their wellbeing."
"We can go ahead and make the citizens pay the consequences of the Maastricht parameters for the euro by saying that we cannot spend money to ensure their health."
"I think this would be a serious mistake."
"I am delighted that in our vote in committee we were able unanimously to appreciate Mr Cabrol's report and all its amendments. I hope that this House will do the same, and that the Commissioner will support Parliament's work and manage to convince the Council this time to do what has to be done in our Europe."
"Mr President, I think at this stage in the debate several things have become clear."
"One is that this Parliament is fortunate enough to have an excellent rapporteur who combines his professional abilities with the political authority to have been able to prepare this report, with contributions from all sides of the House."
"I also think this is a very important message for the European Commission."
"We all have great faith in Commissioner Flynn's negotiating skills. He has often demonstrated his strength of mind and capacity for hard negotiations with the Council."
"Parliament will not fail to give him its support here."
"We must also send a clear message to the Council."
"We do not understand why they should be so little inclined to increase these demands, which represent a practical and heartfelt necessity which would benefit all our citizens."
"The Council should not view the transfer of powers as a loss. They should see it for what it is, as defined in the Treaties: a way to share these powers, the better to help and protect the right to good health of every member of the public."
"That is one of the obligations of all governments, and appears in our constitutions."
"This should also be a call to governments as regards their budgetary provisions for preventative medicine, which are very low at present. In the best cases, the proportion is 2.4 % of the health budget, and in some countries only about 0.4 %."
"That is very little."
"Furthermore, the public has lowered its guard, because it has too much faith in the effectiveness of pharmacological methods, especially antibiotics. Even in the hospitals, the medical staff themselves had failed to attach enough importance to cross-infections, which has led to a major increase in this problem."
"The example of the exponential growth of AIDS shows that the principles of preventative medicine and compulsory safety measures have not been properly applied."
"Mr Commissioner, I beg you when the time comes to approve the agreement on the common external frontier - if we are ever able to approve it - to please make sure that the compulsory external health ruling is included. It is an essential component of the network currently being planned."
"Mr President, I wish to pay proper tribute to Mr Cabrol whose work in committee has been outstanding."
"He is, after all, a man who has today only asked for a railway network, and we are offering and the Council is offering not even a green light on the signal."
"It really is not good enough."
"I do not think the common position of the Council in any way seriously reflects Parliament's amendments."
"I should like to draw the lessons which we should already have drawn from the CJD and BSE crises."
"That was something we had no foreknowledge of."
"We suddenly found ourselves confronted with a disease, or a variant of a disease, which hitherto had been apparently unknown to science."
"Where were we?"
"We were in a muddle! We were in a mess!"
"We have seen the destruction of the European beef industry and justifiable undertaking of protection for the public health of Europe's citizens."
"That is something we ought to learn lessons from, and the obvious one is that there should be a surveillance network."
"As Mr Cabrol says, information collected about communicable diseases will not come together by magic: there has to be a mechanism by which this is achieved."
"I contend that should be by a centre, and that is fundamental to Mr Cabrol's report."
"We need that centre to coordinate information."
"There is also Mrs Marinucci's point on costs and comparative costs."
"What if we do nothing?"
"Are we going to wait yet again for another CJD-type outbreak and take all the consequences again?"
"What kind of criticism will be made of us as parliamentarians, of the European Commission and indeed of the Council?"
"We ought to learn that lesson and give the green light to Mr Cabrol's report."
"Firstly, I thank Parliament for the work that it has done on this issue."
"I particularly want to express my thanks to you, Mr Cabrol, for the very valuable work that you have undertaken, right from the very beginning of this process."
"We are all convinced of the necessity for the European Union to develop its activities in this field and, in particular, to introduce a formal mechanism to share not only information on communicable diseases, but to ensure that a coherent approach is taken with regard to control measures."
"We are all clear that the European Community needs this network."
"The need to have comparable and reliable data on the evolution of diseases such as CreutzfeldtJakob Disease through all of Europe is an obvious example of the importance of having a comprehensive network properly put in place."
"But let me give you another example taken from the latest issues of many European newspapers which reflect the anxieties and fears of our citizens: this is the new Hong Kong chicken flu."
"Although, until now, this has affected only a limited number of people, there is much concern about this new flu strain."
"It is called influenza AH5N1."
"It appears that nobody is immune to this particular strain."
"It is not covered by the 1998 vaccine produced with the advice of the WHO."
"Without a Community network, there would be no possibility of monitoring new cases at Community level and no possibility of defining and coordinating control measures for travellers coming from the Hong Kong region."
"Moreover, should there be an epidemic, we do not know how quickly a vaccine could be produced on a large scale and whether we would have to distribute, on a preventive basis, the only specific drugs available."
"This example illustrates why we strongly believe that this network must not restrict itself just to surveillance, but also encompass control measures."
"We want to create a system which makes it possible to take rapid and effective action."
"We want a system which enables the Community to define protective measures which have to be taken, particularly in situations of emergency."
"We want a system which is not only comprehensive on paper but, in fact, which works in practice."
"This means that it has to be built up in a gradual and pragmatic way."
"In view of this and despite some specific improvements added by the Council, we have had to enter a general reservation regarding the common position, as the text did not give us the means to respond effectively and in a coordinated fashion to epidemics or outbreaks of communicable diseases in a Community without internal borders."
"So the Commission has been very carefully examining the proposed opinions and all the amendments."
"I am pleased to see that they accord very much with the views of the Commission on how the final text of this decision should look."
"I can inform the House that we are willing to accept either wholly or in part 17 of the amendments; 14 can be accepted in full."
"They are: Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 19, 20 and 22."
"For the other three - Amendments Nos 14, 18 and 21 - the Commission will follow Parliament's suggestions, but with an improved wording."
"Let me explain the reason why we consider the remaining five amendments unacceptable."
"Amendment No 1 refers to one recital which, in our view, does not reflect properly the variation in surveillance capacity in the Member States."
"Regarding Amendment No 3, the Commission, as it has stated on the very first reading, believes that rather than restricting the choice of methodologies to the established ones, the possibility must be left open for the development of new and more effective methodologies."
"As to Amendment No 16, the Commission feels that it is necessary for the coordination of measures by the Member States to come under the comitology procedure mentioned in Article 6."
"Therefore a reference to that effect must be made in the fourth paragraph of Article 5."
"Concerning Amendment No 17, the Commission feels that two representatives from each Member State must sit on the committee so as to ensure coverage of both the surveillance and the control branches of the national authorities."
"Let me turn to Amendment No 5, specifically mentioned by the rapporteur, on a European Centre for the surveillance of communicable diseases."
"I fully understand and appreciate the motivation and concerns that have been expressed."
"I share the aim of wanting to reinforce the capacity of the Community to deal with communicable diseases."
"However, this aim has to be achieved in the most practical and straightforward manner and, in particular, it has to take into account the work which has already been undertaken and the structures which already exist in the Community."
"There are already national centres in existence, many of them with considerable experience and expertise in this field."
"There are also several effective disease-oriented networks which are capable of swinging into action quite quickly - something which is crucial for the control of communicable diseases, especially in certain local settings."
"In our view it is much better to build upon and strengthen what already exists and has proved to be working well, rather than to start from scratch and construct a totally new and untried organization."
"This is especially the case with the advent of powerful information technologies which improve our capacity to communicate effectively."
"The Community is investing heavily in linking the national administrations for a variety of joint functions."
"Communicable diseases surveillance and control is one of these."
"For these reasons we cannot accept the amendment."
"Let me just repeat once again my deep appreciation to Parliament and to you, Mr Cabrol, for your efforts and for the close collaboration with the Commission on this particular issue."
"I hope I have explained the Commission's position."
"I trust that before very long we will have this new network."
"It will certainly be a great advance in the development of public health in the Community as soon as it is brought into effect."
"Mr President, it is a point of information arising from what the Commissioner has just said."
"I would like to know from the Commissioner how this network is to be coordinated and by whom across the Union?"
"Mr President, it will in the initial position be coordinated by the Commission."
"I do recognise the point you make, Mr White, that later on when we have further experience it may need to be developed further in the way that you have suggested."
"Thank you, Commissioner Flynn."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Biocidal products"
"The next item is the report (A4-0011/98) by Mrs K. Jensen, on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the placing of biocidal products on the market (C4-0679/97-00/0465(COD))."
"Mr President, when the European Parliament hopefully approves the Conciliation Committee's report on this directive, we will ensure risk assessment at a European level of chemicals which have so far not been covered by other environmental regulations."
"You could say that it is the last major link in the chain of chemical directives which the EU has embarked on introducing, but it is also the last chemical directive from the time before people really began to take a position on chemicals which act like hormones."
"It is a matter we shall return to with the report on hormone-like substances."
"The reason I am mentioning this problem is, of course, because I have a little nagging doubt about the extent to which the directives we have now are sufficiently comprehensive in their environmental protection."
"The biocides directive will provide more safety because it will be easier for citizens to handle these chemicals correctly, and water and soil should also be positively affected by the environmental protection which will come into effect."
"Transparency in the EU should also win with this directive."
"The Council was caught red-handed when it sent the common position to Parliament without the declarations, 14 in all, on the protocol adopted by the Council or jointly by the Council and the Commission."
"That sort of thing is not acceptable in an EU which is open and where legislation is adopted jointly by the Council and Parliament."
"Under the conciliation procedure it is clear that these declarations have no value with regard to the biocides directive, and in future it will be the case that legislation appears in the Act and not in another place beside it."
"That is an obvious advantage for the public, including industry."
"Under the conciliation procedure we have obtained an assurance that a complete technical dossier for the socalled low risk products will be presented, and that this will not be able to include substances which in themselves may give cause for concern."
"At the same time, we have been given an explanation of what is meant by basic substances which are sometimes used as biocides and should be labelled as such, namely carbon dioxide, nitrogen, ethanol, 2-propanol, acetic acid and kieselguhr."
"We have also had our requests granted with regard to the filling in of the new annexes which the Council sought to introduce with the common position."
"The annexes can no longer be called blank cheques because the institutions' modus vivendi on informing the European Parliament in full will be adhered to, but you may of course wonder whether it might take some time to get this confirmed."
"The directive is a pioneer in one area in particular - the assessment of alternatives."
"This ensures that very dangerous substances do not come onto the market if there is a less harmful substance which can be used for the same purpose."
"This approach should be introduced into all the chemicals directives because it safeguards our surroundings and health at the same time as promoting technological development."
"The biocides directive has been criticized in some parts of industry for being too expensive."
"To that we can say that industry has a lot of the information about chemicals and products anyway."
"Long transitional arrangements have been built into the directive, and Parliament has even had a ""fast track procedure' inserted which should not compromise the necessary environmental requirements."
"Mr President, firstly I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jensen, for this work, which has taken her months and has always had our support."
"She has mentioned the subject of Council declarations, which are becoming frequent in codecision procedures."
"And once again in this Parliament, we must reject them outright, because they contravene the spirit and the letter of the Treaties, and are an obvious misrepresentation which this Parliament will never be able to accept."
"Secondly, I think all the institutions have things to learn from the negotiations which arise from codecision."
"Here in Parliament, perhaps we should have presented fewer amendments at the first reading, in order to focus more attention on the essential points."
"The Commission, for its part, had still not realized the meaning of the codecision procedure and Parliament's new responsibilities."
"It resisted meeting Parliament's basic demands right up until the last moment."
"Parliament could not hand over a blank cheque for something as important as the definition of active substances."
"I think the Council will also have to change its working methods. The codecision procedure is pretty revolutionary, and the Council will have to change the way it has been working."
"It always tries to keep a low profile, although that goes against the spirit of the Treaties. The Council will have to get used to deciding by majority, even if it is a qualified majority."
"I also think there is a very clear message which it is important to convey to all the people of Europe. That is, that this Parliament makes use of the powers and responsibilities which are increasingly bestowed upon it by the Treaties."
"The promises contained in the Treaty articles on guidelines to provide the highest levels of protection for people's health and for the environment are going to be fulfilled - in each and every one of the proposals. The people of Europe can rely on that."
"Establishing specific centralized systems, such as for the approval of active substances, benefits everybody. It means that experiments (including animal experiments) are not duplicated; approval procedures can be more easily guaranteed; and arguments and suspicions between Member States can be avoided."
"Therefore, mutual recognition is another added value provided by Community procedure."
"Finally, I think the message to all the people of Europe is that our procedure may be complex, and we may be asking for the codecision procedure to be improved and speeded up (which the Treaty of Amsterdam has done to some extent), but despite all the difficulties, the relationship between the Commission, the Council and Parliament in the codecision procedure is working better and better all the time. That is a very positive message for all our citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would like to thank Parliament and especially the excellent rapporteur, Mrs Kirsten Jensen, and the Council for the progress which has been made during the conciliation procedure with this draft directive which adds a substantial new element to EU legislation on chemicals."
"The purpose of the directive is, as we know, to harmonize the single market for products containing biocides, and to ensure a high level of protection for people and the environment."
"In connection with the second reading, Parliament adopted five amendments."
"Three of these amendments were unacceptable to both the Commission and the Council."
"But, as has also been emphasized here this evening, the subsequent conciliation procedure has borne fruit, and the Conciliation Committee has reached agreement on a compromise solution which is now before Parliament."
"The Council has already given that solution its approval, and I think and hope that Parliament will do the same."
"With regard to Amendments Nos 18 and 19 on the simplified procedure in connection with Annex 1A and 1B, I am convinced that the proposed compromise solution will fulfil the aims of these two annexes, namely to simplify the administration of the directive without reducing the level of heath and environmental protection."
"Parliament wanted to make sure that the modus vivendi was followed in connection with the comitology procedure for the inclusion of active substances in these annexes."
"The Commission is entirely in agreement with Parliament that the decisionmaking process should be absolutely transparent, and it will do its utmost to put this into practice."
"The Commission has promised to present a proposal for the revision of the comitology settlement at the beginning of June 1998."
"We believe that with this undertaking, which President Santer confirmed on 11 November 1997 in a letter to the President of Parliament, we have accommodated Parliament's reservations in this area, as was emphasized by Mr Valvarde LÃ³pez."
"As far as Parliament's Amendment No 17 is concerned, I am satisfied that the Conciliation Committee has reached agreement on a time-limit of 24 months for the incorporation of the directive into national law."
"To sum up, I would like to stress again that the Commission can fully support the compromise solution on which agreement was reached during the conciliation procedure, and I would like to end by once more thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Kirsten Jensen."
"Thank you, Commissioner Bjerregaard."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Cohesion and the information society"
"The next item is the report (A4-0399/97) by Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the Commission communication on cohesion and the information society (COM(97)0007 - C40044/97)."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the starting point of any study of the setting up of the information society within the European Union has to be the fact that things are uneven at the present time. In the near future, this unevenness can lead to imbalances in terms of competitiveness and cohesion, thereby cancelling out the benefits which the use of new technologies can provide in terms of cost."
"This unevenness occurs in the basic infrastructure of the information and communications technologies, and in the cost and reliability of advanced services."
"Such unevenness is producing quantitative and qualitative inequalities, especially in the so-called cohesion countries, where there are basic shortages."
"Availability and ease of access are prerequisites for being able to enjoy the benefits provided by the development of the information society."
"And availability and cost are precisely the factors which at the moment are tending to widen this gap between the European regions, consolidating a situation of quantitative inequality between rich and poor areas."
"This can be illustrated by an example: there is now almost universal access to the public telephone exchange network, but there are still substantial differences in the quality of the services."
"As regards advanced services, progress has been made with cellular telephones (including GSM) but there is still great variation in the availability of rented lines or advanced exchange lines, and with the on-line digital network service."
"Charges are generally higher in the cohesion countries than in the more advanced countries of the Union. Similarly, the number of personal computers is lower."
"In 1995 there were 15.2 PCs for every 100 inhabitants in the most developed regions of Europe, compared with 3.1 in Greece, 8.6 in Spain, 6 in Portugal and 8.9 in Italy."
"This structural weakness, and high costs, hinder the development of regional small and medium-sized enterprises, whose capacity for initiative is lower than that of large companies, and who have less opportunity to obtain strategic information."
"Telephone, electricity and cable companies, and others, who market ICT applications, have opted to seek the maximum economic return in the short term. This means that the costs to the consumer have little relation to the real costs, which inhibits the growth of new technologies, especially in the less well-off regions - specifically, the cohesion countries."
"The skill levels of human resources are also uneven."
"The information society opens up new possibilities for people to gain qualifications, because not only does it mean new teaching instruments, but in particular it also means that sources of knowledge can be almost universally available. This marks the end of that unequal situation whereby a student in a small city is at a disadvantage compared with another in a great metropolis, with access to technical, scientific and history libraries."
"To a large extent, the opening up of these possibilities promises to lead to the decentralization of sources of culture, and an increasing number of centres for the diffusion of culture. In the medium term, this can contribute to social cohesion."
"However, if the structural weaknesses of the school systems are not taken into account, the inequalities may increase."
"The possibility that investments may be delayed in certain regions means there may be a polarization between those who have information and those who do not."
"To avoid such polarization, we need political action to tackle the profound structural changes imposed by the information society, in working practices, methods of business organization and public administration."
"That policy is partly lacking, as shown by the fact that only 2 % of the structural funds are spent on investment in the telecommunications sector."
"The cost of the information society should be part of the ""mainstreaming' of the structural funds."
"In fact, the structural funds have played a central role in laying the foundations of the information society, despite the lack of investment."
"But we need an integrated approach, to satisfy public administration, the teaching system, industry and consumers."
"In conclusion, I want to point out that for the sake of cohesion, charges to consumers and costs to businesses need to be set at a reasonable level. Similarly, access to modern information tools, particularly the Internet, cannot be based on private individuals purchasing PCs or other equipment, but requires easily accessible work stations for the public to share, and the consequent funding of an open telecommunications network."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the Commission's timely communication on cohesion and the information society has received an important response from Parliament in the form of Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez' report, which is extremely accurate and detailed, and focuses precisely on the set of problems which concern us."
"It is no surprise to me that Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez' report logically tackles what I believe to be the crux of the problem - and the aspect that worried the Commission when they sent us this communication about the information society and cohesion."
"For Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez begins her report by talking about competitiveness."
"And the fundamental idea behind cohesion today (which many people do not understand properly) is the ability to generate competitiveness in those regions which are strategically less well advanced, so they can be brought up to the same level as the other regions."
"That is the fundamental aspect, not the almost religious connotations which some people like to attribute to the concept of cohesion."
"We are talking about an instrument - the information and communications technologies - which is fundamental to the future development of competitiveness, and to an increased quality of life for our citizens."
"To achieve that competitiveness, the immediate requirement in the less favoured regions is for small and medium-sized enterprises to be able to equip themselves properly, so that they can rise to the challenges of competition, stabilize their businesses today and in the future, and guarantee job stability. The net result will be to create cohesion - competitiveness, in other words."
"It is hard to see how any small business in a less favoured region can survive the challenge without introducing electronic commerce, for example."
"It is difficult to imagine that a small or medium-sized enterprise could engage in research and innovation without having a fully operational system of information and communications technologies."
"Well, how effective are all these discussions we hold in this Parliament?"
"What is the basic factor needed in order to plant the information society firmly within European society?"
"Let us be realistic."
"The Commission's wish to include activities connected with information and communications technologies in the structural funds, as a significant part of them, is obvious and highly commendable. However, possible actions by the Commission or using the structural funds will not exhaust the market."
"The market has a mind of its own and is extremely powerful. It is a veritable superpower compared with the potential of subsidies from the European institutions."
"Therefore, we need to make it quite clear that at the moment the main stumbling block hindering the information society's insertion into society is the charges set by telephone, electricity and cable companies seeking maximum returns in the shortest possible time. And that is what I want the Commissioner to think about with us, although the idea is not new to her."
"I would like her to consider the extent to which the European Commission is prepared to sit down at the table with these operators, as one of their most important customers, and make them bring their prices down to realistic levels which will allow demand to increase, and will give easy access to everybody, no matter which European region they happen to be in. I would also like her to consider how far the Commission is prepared to go in fulfilling its responsibilities, not just by making it possible to act through the structural funds, but also sending out a serious message that will persuade these companies to allow everybody to have access to these services, which are so vital for the present and the future."
"If that cannot be done, we are just designing the new shape of European inequality."
"The Commissioner knows that very well, which is why I am not presenting this as a complaint, but just asking for her help and collaboration."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I was going to say that we are rather a select band of debaters this evening but colleagues are coming out of the background; perhaps the information society is working indeed."
"First, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the broad thrust of her report on cohesion and the information society."
"There can be little doubt of the importance of information and communication technology - the information society - to our economy and to our lifestyle."
"In particular it opens up all manner of possibilities for remote rural areas, for ultra-peripheral islands and poorer less favoured regions with a low density of population and limited transport infrastructure."
"In my constituency of Devon and East Plymouth which contains cities and isolated farming communities there are numerous ICT projects in hand: for distance learning, for academic exchanges of information with the universities in other Member States, for training, for business such as a satellite link ISDN video for cattle auction by remote bidding or for telesales operations."
"The Internet for both recreational study or for business use is catching on fast in our part of the world."
"All of this adds up to the possibility of job creation and business start-ups which do not have to be subsidized, which leads me to say that if I were to find fault with any part of Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez' report it would be where it suggests any intervention in the pricing and the market mechanism of the information society, or where it suggests additional spending in the European budget beyond existing lines for structural funds and the cohesion fund."
"The best way to expand ICT in Europe is to let market forces and technology get on with it."
"Competition and customers are powerful forces for growth and for better services."
"There is not enough money in the European budget to pay for all the items on the shopping list, or should I say ""wish list' , of spending proposals in this report."
"By all means ask for a greater proportion of structural funds to be spent on this instead of something else, but let us be realistic about not asking for more money when it is not there."
"Instead let us agree that ICT holds out great promise for disadvantaged regions, and the forces of competition and technology will deliver."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I think we should congratulate ourselves on the fact that the Committee on Regional Policy is talking about the information society and the effect it will have on European cohesion."
"We need to stress the impact the information society will have on the new activities which will be developed in industry, trade and services, and on overcoming the frontiers and borders between Member States."
"Nor must we forget what the information society will mean for training, now that we talk of life-long training or continuing training."
"The information society removes the need for teachers and students to be in the same place at the same time."
"It is possible to be taught in your own home, by a teacher from another place and time."
"The information society offers a wide range of opportunities. However, those opportunities must be available to all the people of Europe if we really want cohesion at European level."
"The opportunities should exist throughout the whole extent of the European Union, including rural, peripheral and island zones."
"There is a lot of talk about information superhighways."
"I would prefer to use the term ""information roads' or ""information routes' ."
"Superhighways, or motorways, often charge tolls - not in Germany, Madam Commissioner, but in other countries."
"If we want information to reach every location, it should travel by roads which do not have tolls, but are open to all."
"Therefore, I am very pleased with Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez' report, because it talks about the potential limitations to the information society, in the sense that it may fail to benefit everybody, and that those responsible for its development may seek nothing more than financial profitability."
"We already know that such financial profitability, like toll motorways, will only form links between major population centres, leaving many others marginalized. That is not what should happen with the information society we want for the European Union."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no-one doubts that the new information and communication technologies can have positive effects on education and training, on changing times and the organization of work, on business modernization at the most varied levels, and consequently on people's increased opportunities for free time and leisure."
"However, I have several reservations to add to the somewhat rosy-coloured picture painted by the Commission with regard to the relationship between cohesion and the so-called information society, especially because, in a context in which state responsibility is declining, owing to the privatization of companies and services which at the outset might be in a better position to deal with the problems that might affect the less developed regions, it is difficult to see how the prospect of a large and easy profit is compatible with the universality and fairness of citizens' rights and the objects of inter-regional and inter-State cohesion within our Union."
"The report draws attention to the dangers that uncontrolled, unregulated growth of such an information society might cause, by creating new and deeper divisions in the economic and social development between rich and poor regions. Such divisions might relate to: differences in infrastructure and access to information; discrepancies in the opportunities for gaining access to education and training - promoting and accentuating new forms of exclusion; or costs that might affect small and medium-sized enterprises in the cohesion countries and the respective most backward regions."
"The recommendations set out in the report drawn up by Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez - whom I congratulate warmly although there are no more than half a dozen of us here - the recommendations set out in the report, as I was saying, for the structural funds to play a far more substantial part in the materialization and construction of infrastructures, in education, training and research-related aspects, naturally deserve our full support."
"The same support should be given to the proposal that, in the division and respect for their respective populations, the governments of the Member States should be responsible for defining and regulating the context in which universal access to information and provision of public services should be provided."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and the Commissioner for her interest and, indeed, involvement in this important issue."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for grasping the importance of the information technologies in reducing the environmental burden of development actions, for example by reducing the need for mobility or the need for transport infrastructures."
"In particular, I refer to paragraph 20 which recommends that the total or partial substitution of 'physical' investments by the supply of adequate telecommunications services in such a way as to minimize the cost of investment and the constraints on the environment be systematically included as part of the evaluation process of investments financed by the structural funds and be a substantial part of the national programmes as presented in the framework of these funds."
"I should also like to stress that the information technologies should not create greater regional and social disparities: they should contribute to reducing such disparities."
"Therefore, existing imbalances and discrepancies between core and peripheral regions should be counterbalanced by giving special stress to the setting up of information highways and facilities in the peripheral regions."
"Unless we take action in this regard, there is a risk that these opportunities will not be available in the peripheral regions and that differences will become even greater."
"So we need to take proactive measures in regard to this."
"The information society should continue to be considered as services of general interest, and investment in information infrastructures should comply with the principles of equality, continuity and affordability so that market logic does not discriminate against the needs for access to information of peripheral regions and vulnerable social groups."
"If the benefits that the information society would make accessible to every citizen in the European Union are to achieve optimum advantages, the costs must be set at a reasonable level."
"I take the point made by Mr Chichester in this regard, but we must ensure that they are set at reasonable levels."
"In particular, I would ask not just the Commission but the Council to be involved here and to ensure that the suppliers of education, particularly to schools, allow free access."
"Hardware is one thing, software is another: but the actual telecommunications providers are often either the state or some kind of monopoly."
"They can well afford to provide low-level or free access to schools."
"It would be an extremely important achievement throughout the Union if our young citizens got free access to these services at a training level."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I come from a country which is not particularly rich, and which is on the edge of Europe."
"I was born on an island where the children did not have all the equipment that was available to children born for example in Athens, the capital of Greece, or indeed in other large cities of Europe."
"On this island, as on the other Greek islands, illness was and is a much bigger problem than it is in Athens or in any other large European urban centre."
"Why am I saying all this?"
"I am saying it because I believe the information society provides some answers to problems of this kind."
"Children can connect up to the Internet and have access to information, something which could not even be imagined a few years ago."
"Tele-medicine can provide an answer to some serious health problems."
"The new prospects for commerce and economic life may keep people in the peripheral regions."
"However, this is not something which will happen automatically."
"The information society will not suddenly appear in the remote and island regions tomorrow morning just because we are debating it here."
"There need to be policies to maximize the advantages offered by the information society and, at the same time, to limit its dangers, making the information society a humane society, a society of equal opportunities. I think that is the desire of all of us in this House."
"So what do I believe?"
"I believe that it is necessary to move perhaps even more quickly towards the liberalization of telecommunications, since this will help towards speedier and cheaper access for everybody to the opportunities of the information society."
"Nor let us forget that the more widespread the use, the cheaper the purchase."
"I also believe that we must ensure that there is information available in as many languages as possible, because this is an issue which is related to equality of opportunity, to enable everyone to have access to this new world which is being opened up."
"At the same time, I believe we must make use of the resources of the structural funds, especially in the new period of 2000 to 2006, so that we can introduce information technology into schools and public sector services (an essential step for the modernization of education and public administration), promote the new technologies on the islands and in the inaccessible and remote regions (using it in tele-education and telemedicine), and take advantage of available resources and professional training to bring about familiarization with the new world of knowledge and information."
"I think Agenda 2000 is an opportunity for us to take a serious look at the issue, since I think that essentially the second Delors Package has finished - it finishes in 1999 - in view of the Salter Package."
"I think we can look at this matter closely, Madam Commissioner."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, information technology and telecommunications have opened up tremendous opportunities to cover distance and overcome obstacles, nurturing decentralization and regional equality."
"But in practice, to fulfill these goals we need a clear working strategy as well as strong political will."
"Every region and citizen must have access to the basics of the information network."
"Among the requirements of an equal information society are the availability of new information technology, like the Internet, in public places such as libraries and schools, as well as multi-lingual software and facilities."
"Furthermore, we need effective training, not only in how to use the equipment, but in understanding how the systems work."
"What is especially important, I think, is to train professionals in the computer industry to help ordinary people find and use the information they need."
"At the regional level, it is also vital to pay attention to the needs of small firms and their readiness to become information literate. There is a demand for the new skills, and they create jobs."
"Thus, structural funding must seek to give better support to the low-profile regions in their application of the information society."
"Mr President, first let me thank Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez most sincerely for her report on the significance of the information society for EU cohesion policy."
"It broadly agrees both with the Commission's analysis of the situation and with its conclusions."
"The Commission also believes that the information society is of strategic importance for economic and social cohesion and for employment."
"It will certainly also constitute a key technology for regional development, provided that structurally underdeveloped areas, rural districts and peripheral regions can be guaranteed access to information and communications technologies."
"It is certainly well worthwhile using information and best-practices technology to make the most of the opportunities available, but to do so we first have to draw attention to the fact that these opportunities exist, and implement a suitable awareness and education programme."
"In this respect, technological development is only one side of the problem."
"Our main aim should be to give the regions themselves - that is to say, their inhabitants and their businesses - the capacity to exploit the possibilities of the information society in order to strengthen the competitiveness of the economy, particularly as far as small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned, and to promote regional development."
"To achieve this we need a regulative framework which, by guaranteeing universal employment, is capable of ensuring a fair system of access and job costing, and is able to adapt this concept of universal employment to meet changing technological and social conditions."
"To this effect we require practical assistance, which includes not only investment in infrastructure but also the provision of education and training schemes to enable people to obtain the necessary job qualifications."
"This in turn will require a research development programme to promote a user-friendly information society and the continued development of transmission and application systems for businesses and citizens alike."
"In order to reduce the technology gap which exists between the core and the peripheral regions of the EU we need to offer companies incentives to provide up-to-date job opportunities even in the less well developed areas."
"This is by no means only a question of investment aid, but can also include the organization of a demand market or the provision of public access to modern information networks, which have already been called for here, in schools, libraries, town halls and job centres - as our IRISI project demonstrates."
"On the basis of its communication on cohesion and the information society, the Commission is seeking to concentrate its efforts and to use the synergy which exists between the different initiatives. The communication also attempts to highlight economic and social cohesion in telecommunications and research policy, and to incorporate the transition to the information society into the EU's mainstream structural programmes."
"For this purpose, the Commission has set up an Action Centre whose main role will be to coordinate the activities of the individual Directorates-General in promoting the information society."
"A Committee on Cohesion and the Information Society is currently being set up as part of this Action Centre's mandate. The aim of this committee will be to ensure that social cohesion is one of the dimensions included in all Community policies which are relevant to the information society."
"The information society is one of the themes of the forthcoming Fifth Framework Programme for Research."
"About 25 % of all funds provided under the Fifth Framework Programme are to be allocated to research actions associated with the information society."
"The Commission has also extended the current forum debate on the information society to include eastern Europe, in order to involve the applicant countries in these deliberations; this is also one of the requirements associated with new membership."
"The draft of the first report on universal employment is currently being prepared and the Commission has, as you know, already laid down guidelines for the financing of universal employment in a competition-oriented environment."
"Finally, in its half-time review of Objective 1 regions, and within the framework of the second programme-planning period for Objective 2, the Commission has called upon Member States to use the strategic potential of the information society for regional development purposes."
"It is not enough just to have the Commission's opinion that this is an important development instrument. What is really needed is to convince the regions and the Member States of this, since they are the ones who, in the programming stage, are taking the decisions on assisted projects."
"If we want them to promote more information projects, then we must begin by helping them to amend their priorities and overcome the fear of the information society which still prevails."
"We can be sure of one thing, which is that the information society will be one of the key themes for the next generation of structural fund programmes."
"In this respect, the Commission is helping the regions to improve their planning vis-Ã -vis the information society so that in future they can make greater use of relevant projects and best practices."
"More than 30 regions are or were involved in these actions, which were aimed at improving cooperation between the public and private sectors, to the effect that in this area we can eliminate the subsidy mentality and put in its place a mentality which really seeks to make the most of new opportunities, to establish and structure the needs of those players who are involved in the information society at regional level, and to support the regions in building up a partnership between the main regional players."
"I am convinced that if we succeed in driving this process forward, then we can rely on the fact that the market will react to demand, and also to the organization of demand-driven interests. This is something which will not happen automatically but which will require a helping hand from us."
"I hope you will continue to support us in our endeavours."
"Thank you, Commissioner Wulf-Mathies."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.00 pm.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of Tuesday 13 January have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, it is stated in the Minutes that over the last ten years the US dollar has been devalued by 50 %, causing the loss of 18 million jobs."
"In fact only 1.3 million jobs have been lost."
"Mr RÃ¼big, I think you are referring to the verbatim report of proceedings."
"However, we shall look into the matter."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Membership of political groups"
"I must inform you that Mr Kerr is now a member of the Green Group in the European Parliament, with effect from 1 January 1998."
"Thank you very much, Mr Kerr."
"The Minutes will be corrected."
"Topical and urgent debate (objections)"
"The next item is the voting on objections concerning the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Mr President, a point of order before we vote on the objections introduced regarding matters of urgency, on the one hand from the Green Group regarding Tibet, and on the other the Liberal Group, regarding Kenya."
"Our group is in agreement with these objections, but as the two groups did not announce them at the Conference of Presidents, we have not been able to submit our group's resolutions on the same subject for review."
"Thus, if you are in agreement, I would like our resolutions B4-1476/98 regarding Tibet and B4-0084/98 regarding Kenya, also to be submitted to the vote which is going to take place."
"We will deal with the matter immediately."
"British Presidency and the situation in Algeria"
"The next item is the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on the British Presidency's programme, and the situation in Algeria."
"Mr Cook has the floor."
"Mr President, President of the Commission and honourable Members, the Luxembourg Presidency demonstrated yet again that the smallest nations of Europe are the equals of the largest."
"Its presidency was capable, efficient, and dynamic."
"It is a hard act to follow."
"I understand that it is traditional for the incoming presidency to begin its speech to the European Parliament by saying that at this moment Europe is at a particularly important stage in its development."
"I understand why they do that."
"After all, it is always true."
"And it is good that successive presidencies approach their task with that sense of excitement, because the advantage to Europe of a rotating presidency is that every new presidency brings its own new national drive, a new range of experience, and a new determination to make its mark."
"Britain has the privilege of holding the presidency as Europe takes two real historic steps."
"In the next six months our presidency will act as pilot both to economic and monetary union and to the enlargement process with the Central Europeans and Cyprus."
"These are momentous projects."
"The British Presidency will work closely with the European Parliament to give both economic and monetary union and enlargement the best possible start."
"Both of us - Parliament and presidency - have a duty to Europe and to our electors to work together in cooperating for a successful launch of both projects."
"When the new Labour Government in Britain was elected in May, we promised we would transform our relations with Europe."
"We have done that."
"Britain is now a committed player in Europe."
"(Applause) We believe that when Europe works together the result is better for every country in Europe."
"The problems we face are common problems which demand common solutions."
"Problems like global warming and international crime are not ones that any one nation can solve on its own."
"Today nations are as interdependent as they once were independent."
"The world has changed since the times of Monnet, Spaak and Schuman, but every change has made their vision of European cooperation more compelling than before."
"Britain wants to use its presidency to create an effective and inclusive Union that is open to the whole of Europe."
"That is why we are so concerned to make a success out of economic and monetary union and enlargement."
"We also want to build a Union that responds to the real concerns of the European peoples."
"That is why we want to take forward work on jobs, the environment and crime."
"We want to make the Union efficient, so we will focus on the reform agenda and start to prepare the European Union for the challenges of the next century."
"And we want to make it a more effective voice in the world, so we will be working to improve the performance of the common foreign and security policy."
"The new British Government is committed to making a success of European cooperation, and our presidency will be an affirmation of this."
"Economic and monetary union will be a most momentous step."
"During our presidency the key decision will be made on who qualifies for Stage Three of EMU - which currencies are to be locked together in the single currency."
"The European Parliament will, of course, have a key role to play in that decision."
"Britain will be in the chair when the crucial decision is made next May."
"We will discharge this responsibility to the best of our abilities, fully and scrupulously, in a way that we hope will show Europe at its most constructive best."
"We want economic and monetary union to be a success."
"Britain itself will not be in the first wave, but that does not mean that we have no interest in the success of monetary union."
"Our economy is bound up in that of the continent and we have as much reason as any country of the continent to work for a successful launch."
"We are also committed to making enlargement a success."
"The Luxembourg Summit opened the road to enlargement."
"Now it falls to us to get the process moving ahead down that road."
"During the British Presidency we will be launching the Accession Process for all applicants, as well as starting negotiations with those countries that want to join the European Union."
"It is a process in which the European Parliament will have a crucial role to play."
"We must be sure to work together, because enlarging the European Union is an historic opportunity, both for Europe and for the new Members."
"It will give an immense boost to all our economies."
"It will create a wider, stronger Europe."
"It will fulfil the challenge set eight years ago when the Iron Curtain was brought down and will enable us to create a prosperous, self-confident and more stable Europe."
"We have got rid of the Iron Curtain."
"It is important that we do not tolerate in its place a velvet curtain which separates the affluent nations of Western Europe from poorer countries on its borders in central and eastern Europe."
"The last 50 years of division in Europe have been an aberration in our history."
"In the history of Europe its great cultural figures, such as Mozart, Chopin, Goethe or Voltaire, would not have recognized a concept of a Europe that was divided in the way it has been in the past 50 years."
"It falls to our generation to have the great opportunity of finally ending that division by opening the doors of the European Union to the new democracies of central and eastern Europe."
"We have two important but practical objectives for the British Presidency on enlargement."
"First, to get the actual negotiations off to a flying start."
"And, second, to help those who have further to travel - to make sure that all the applicant countries feel included in the process."
"We will continue to provide support along the way to all those applicants: support to help them to reform their economies, privatize their state-owned corporations, strengthen their public administrations."
"That is why Britain itself will be assisting in providing training for some of the negotiators on the side of the Central European countries that are applying."
"We are assisting in the training of their negotiators because we believe these negotiations are not confrontational or adversarial."
"These negotiations have one common purpose: to make a success of enlargement."
"The inaugural meeting of the European Conference will be held on 12 March in London."
"It will be a visible demonstration of the inclusive Europe we want to build."
"We also want it to be a substantive meeting, discussing issues that matter to all our peoples, both in the Member States and the candidate countries alike - on the environment, drugs and organized crime."
"The prospect of Cyprus joining the European Union offers us the opportunity of contributing to peace and the prosperity of all of the people of that island."
"The European Union firmly supports the United Nations SecretaryGeneral in his efforts to find a political solution on Cyprus."
"We hope the leaders of the two communities will resume UN-led negotiations after the elections."
"We welcome the willingness of the government of Cyprus to include Turkish Cypriots in the delegation for accession negotiations."
"We would like to see a bizonal, bicommunal, federal Cyprus join the European Union."
"But Cyprus is entitled to have its application for membership considered on its own strong merits, and its progress must not be conditional on a solution to the division of the island."
"We will also work hard to strengthen relations between the European Union and Turkey."
"Turkey matters, both as a major player in an important region, and as a long-time ally of Europe."
"We recognize Turkey's European vocation, and the need to draw her into the enlargement process."
"We have laid down criteria for all states wishing to join the European Union: the need for a market economy, democratic governance and observance of human rights."
"Turkey's candidacy for membership of the European Union must be judged by the same objective criteria as any other country."
"Britain wants to reconnect the peoples of Europe with the European Union which their governments are trying to create."
"Our peoples need to know that the European Union is relevant to their lives."
"To them the European Union sometimes seems to spend too much of its time discussing things that do not touch their lives: abstractions and theories, rather than a concrete agenda."
"Our people need to believe that their worries dictate our agenda in Europe."
"Three issues are of paramount concern to the people of Europe: employment, jobs and crime and the environment."
"I know they are your priorities."
"They will also be ours."
"First, employment."
"It does not matter in which country you ask the question."
"If you ask people what they worry about most, there is only one answer in all our countries: jobs."
"I am sure it is what you hear in your constituencies among your electors."
"Over 18 million people are unemployed in the European Union."
"Five million of them are under 25."
"That means one in ten of Europe's young people are without a job."
"Each one is not a figure, but a tragedy, a waste of talent and an alienation from our societies and our economies."
"The modern economy is very exciting for those who are prepared for it, for those with the skills and the confidence to flourish in the new market-place."
"But many are intimidated by it, and many are excluded from it."
"Our task must be to build in Europe a modern market economy but with just, inclusive societies."
"I believe it can be done and that Europe can show how."
"The Union has a major role in that process. The Jobs Summit in Luxembourg set an agenda for putting Europe back to work."
"Britain will use its presidency to pursue that agenda with vigour. By helping governments find the best ways to help their people find jobs, and by pursuing the four goals agreed at the Luxembourg Jobs Summit, which match well with the new British Government's own priorities."
"Employability, so that our people have the skills they need to find work. Flexibility and adaptability, so that our companies can adapt to a fast-changing market."
"Entrepreneurship, so that we can turn Europe's creativity and innovation into jobs and growth, particularly in small and medium enterprise companies. Finally, equal opportunities, so that all those who want to work are given the chance, not just the young and the able-bodied."
"At the Cardiff Summit, one of the top priorities will be to review progress on the Action Plans on unemployment now being drawn up by every Member State under guidelines agreed at Luxembourg."
"A key part of staying competitive must be making the single market work and completing the single market."
"We will be working hard on the single market action plan approved in Amsterdam and, together with the Austrian Presidency, we aim to get it completed by the end of 1998."
"The action plan gives us a full programme."
"We want single market rules applied quickly and enforced better."
"We want to engage the Commission and the European Parliament in producing better, simpler legislation."
"We want to remove barriers so that Europe can benefit fully from the huge potential of the information society and electronic commerce."
"Our aim is an effective single market, free from hidden barriers or unfair state aid, which leads to real prosperity."
"Then we will have a Europe that can work for the people, and put the people back to work."
"The second major concern for the people is crime."
"The drugs trade is worth about $400 billion a year around the globe, second only to the oil trade in value."
"It is one of the most integrated of trades in Europe."
"If we are to catch the criminals who carry out that trade, then we need to match their cross-border work and their international cooperation."
"We need to match it with teamwork and international cooperation of our own."
"(Applause) As a presidency, we want to get Europol launched as soon as we can, so that Europe's police forces can work together effectively."
"We will take a fresh initiative against high-tech crime."
"New means of cross-border communication such as the Internet offer tremendous new opportunities for access to information and freedom of expression."
"But they are also open to risks of abuse, which we can only fight if we fight it together."
"We will attack the drugs trade right at its heart by helping the drug-producing countries in Central Asia stem the flow."
"We must show the people that the European Union shares their fears and concerns, and is able to act to tackle them."
"The last of those concerns is the environment."
"The people of Europe want us to be serious in our duty to take care of the planet and to hand it on to our children in good order."
"Right across the board, European Union activities need to secure a sustainable Europe."
"We will use the British Presidency to put environmental considerations centre stage in the European Union's decision-making process."
"They should be at the heart of all our policies. Not an afterthought or an appendix."
"The European Union transport policy has a major impact on the environment."
"Let us ensure it is a positive one."
"To make this a reality, we will be holding a joint Transport and Environment Council in June."
"We will be taking forward the proposals for higher standards on vehicle emissions to create a higher quality of clean air for our people."
"By linking the two, we can help to ensure that Europe's transport policy is friendly to Europe's environment."
"The British Presidency comes at the same time as three important international projects on the environment: the follow-up to the Kyoto climate change talks, negotiations in the UN on providing clean water, and talks on managing the world's forests."
"Kyoto proved that the European Union can be an impressive world leader on the environment."
"But Kyoto did not take us all the way to our goal."
"Where agreement was reached, we now need to take its implementation forward, and where we did not reach agreement, we need discussion to take forward further agreement with our partners worldwide."
"Jobs, crime and the environment."
"Those are the concerns of the people of Europe."
"Those are the priorities for the British Presidency."
"But there must also be progress on the reform agenda for Europe itself."
"Tomorrow's fast-moving world belongs to those who respond fastest, those who change fastest and those who modernize."
"The people want to see a European Union that works efficiently and fairly for their benefit."
"The Agenda 2000 reforms proposed by the Commission make up an exciting programme to modernize the European Union."
"The European Union has to change to meet the challenges posed by enlargement, but also the challenges from a changing world."
"The European Union has to make some hard choices."
"The common agricultural policy is perhaps the clearest example."
"It made sense in the 1950s against a background of food shortages."
"A common policy is no less relevant today but it needs modernization."
"The Commission was mandated at Luxembourg to bring forward legislative proposals."
"During our presidency we will want to make sure that work takes place."
"I know the strength of feeling on reform of the common agricultural policy, and the divergence of views about it."
"But there is much we can agree on."
"A new agricultural policy that will still support our farmers, but at a lower cost to our taxpayers and at a lower cost to the consumer, preserving rural communities and also the rural environment."
"I know there are many in the European Parliament who will want to see a shift in our policy so we can devote more of our resources to the areas most relevant to today's concerns."
"(Applause) We will use our presidency to work with you to ensure that our money is well spent."
"The people want to know that the burden is shared fairly, that regional aid goes to help the poorest areas, the areas which need them most."
"They want hard action on mismanagement and fraud, to know that their money is not being wasted."
"Making the European Union work more efficiently for the people will be our priority."
"Another will be making it accessible to the people."
"We will propose measures to make the European Union more transparent, including opening up the Council of Ministers still further."
"If the people are to believe that the European Union belongs to them, they must at the very least know what is being discussed and how things are decided by us."
"(Applause) I also want the British Presidency to help restore the people's faith that the European Union can speak and act for them in the world."
"I say both 'speak' and 'act' deliberately."
"It is important that the European Union's voice is heard quickly and authoritatively."
"But it is also important that we match our words with deeds and show that action by the European Union can have an impact."
"The European Union can and should be a major player on the world stage."
"We will use our presidency to launch a European Union Code of Conduct on arms exports, to establish agreed standards for all exports of arms by European Union members."
"We will implement the new European Union Joint Action on landmines, which reaffirms the Union's commitment to a complete global ban, and to its programme of landmine clearance and help for victims of landmines."
"(Applause) We will work for a coherent European approach to human rights, and make sure it has real impact by working in partnership and dialogue with other countries."
"We will continue the Union's efforts to strengthen its relations with the rest of the world."
"I will be travelling tomorrow to Washington and Ottawa to brief the US and Canada on our plans for the presidency."
"In May we will be holding summits with both countries."
"I will be going to Latin America in February to chair the European Union/Rio and European Union/San JosÃ© ministerial meetings."
"Tony Blair will be chairing the Second Asia-Europe Meeting in London in April, the first such summit with Asia on European soil and an important milestone in our relations with Asia."
"During our presidency we will also aim to reach agreement on the European Union mandate for negotiations on a successor to the LomÃ© Convention."
"Under our presidency the European Union will continue to work with our partners to help implement the peace agreements in Bosnia."
"We will seek to improve the speed and effectiveness of the European Union's aid effort to that region."
"We will make sure that the European Union continues to make a positive contribution to the Middle East Peace Process."
"We are disturbed by the current deadlock, which is a matter of vital concern to the European Union as much as it is to anybody else."
"For this reason, we will be working to complement the efforts of the United States to broker talks between both sides and we will be examining how Europe can facilitate progress on practical measures, such as the Gaza airport and seaport."
"I should also like to say that we share the deep concern of the European Parliament over recent events in Algeria."
"You have made your feelings clear, most notably through your award of the 1997 Sakharov Prize to Selima Ghezali."
"Her work, in the most difficult circumstances, is a cogent reminder to the world of the problems that Algeria faces."
"The latest massacres, and the scale of the savagery involved, have been appalling."
"People across Europe are united in revulsion and horror by the stories they have read in the press from Algeria in recent weeks."
"The British Ambassador, on behalf of the presidency, has sought permission from the Algerian authorities to visit the sites of the recent horrific atrocities."
"We want to find out how we can help."
"We have seen no evidence to support allegations of involvement by the Algerian security authorities."
"The world's media have a keen interest in these dramatic events."
"It is in the interests of the Algerian authorities to let the press see for themselves what is going on in their country and who is responsible for the terrorism."
"The governments of the international community also have a legitimate interest."
"We have learnt too often in the past that if we allow terrorism to take root in any one country, it can all too quickly be exported to other countries."
"(Applause) That is why the British Presidency readily took up the proposal to send a troika mission to Algeria."
"Such a mission will both examine how the European Union can help end the terrorism and demonstrate the strong feelings of the peoples of Europe for the terror and sufferings of the people of Algeria."
"I give you an assurance that the presidency will keep the European Parliament fully informed."
"In conclusion, I should like to say that in even a long speech one can only provide a snapshot of a programme for six months of a presidency."
"It is an ambitious and full programme, a programme that demonstrates the Europe that Britain and the European Parliament want to see."
"An inclusive Europe that is prosperous, open and peaceful, an efficient Union that cooperates effectively on the things that matter to our people and speaks for them clearly and forcefully in the world."
"The European Parliament has a key role in that vision."
"The British Government has been working to build up our links with Parliament - links that possibly were not kept at their strongest by the previous British government - and we have developed our presidency agenda in close consultation with yourself and with other Members of this European Parliament."
"We want our presidency to ensure that you are given the best possible chance to play your important role in the crucial decisions ahead of us."
"Yours will be an important voice in the debate on economic and monetary union."
"You must give your assent to enlargement."
"When the Amsterdam Treaty comes into force you will have a much-expanded brief for legislation."
"The British Presidency is determined to engage in an equal dialogue with you in all these areas, from the plenary debates to your committee rooms."
"But your role goes much wider than this."
"I believe that the European Parliament has a crucial part to play in our mission of giving the European Union back to the people, in explaining the key issues to the people of Europe, in ensuring they have the chance to speak and that their voice is heard."
"As a government that believes in an open, transparent Europe and in a Europe that reflects the views of ordinary people and acts on their concerns, we believe you have a vital role."
"We will not always agree but I can assure you that your views will always be listened to."
"We are at the threshold of creating a wider, stronger Europe; a Europe which stretches from Warsaw to Edinburgh; a peaceful, prosperous and confident Europe; a Europe which can speak with one voice in the world but which respects and encourages different national cultures to flourish within the Union."
"It has fallen to Britain to take the mantle of presidency when these opportunities are within our grasp."
"We need your help if we are to grasp these opportunities."
"I know you will give us that help."
"(Loud applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"Mrs Green now has the floor."
"Mr President-in-Office, it is the most tremendous pleasure for me to welcome you to the European Parliament today."
"As a British Labour MEP, I take delight in being able to welcome the first Labour Government Minister in this Chamber for over two decades."
"(Applause from the left) As leader of the Socialist Group in this House, I know that Socialists, Social Democrats - and some other Members of this House as well - were mightily relieved to see the back of the previous government which was most hostile to, most dishonest about and most obstructive in the European Union."
"(Applause from the left) On 4 May, just three days after the British general election, the Observer newspaper carried the headline 'Goodbye Xenophobia' ."
"The first positive message of the new government and from the President-in-Office in particular was towards the European Union."
"The Foreign Secretary is very welcome here."
"On 16 December 1992 at the conclusion of the last British Presidency my colleague and predecessor Jean-Pierre Cot addressed the then British Prime Minister and said: ' At the outset of the British Presidency, I looked forward confident in my belief that those traditional British characteristics of fair play and efficiency would make it a success' ."
"But, more, we hope that this presidency, in seeking to carry out its priorities will demonstrate the drive, the vigour, imagination, flair and vision which has marked the first eight months of the government's stewardship of Britain."
"It will be no surprise to the Foreign Secretary or to this House that my group endorses the major policy priorities which he has outlined to us today as his plan of work for the next six months."
"Colleagues in my group will deal with that agenda - jobs, drugs, the environment, the foreign affairs agenda, in detail during the course of the debate today."
"I want to raise just two issues in particular."
"Firstly, enlargement of the Union to Cyprus and central and eastern Europe."
"We welcome the President-in-Office's commitment to open the process of enlargement in an inclusive and transparent way in March in London."
"I know that the British government believes in making hard choices."
"I want to ask the President-in-Office to take up the hard option which in our view accompanies the opening conference and that is to begin the process of discussing the complex issue which was not concluded at Amsterdam and which the Luxembourg summit at least had the grace to admit must be tackled."
"It is not popular or easy to raise what is often regarded as the navel-gazing issues of institutional reform."
"But the simple truth is that the European Union will not work without greater qualified majority voting..."
"...let alone the re-weighting of votes, numbers of Commissioners and so on."
"Similarly, the word is out that the reforms of both the common agricultural policy and the structural funds which you mentioned will simply not even begin until the end of this year when the German election is over."
"Nobody expects that these questions can be resolved in the next six months but please do not pretend that they just do not exist."
"The second issue I want to raise is a the decision which must be taken on the euro during the first few days of May of this year."
"This Parliament, as the President-in-Office said, has a unique and very particular responsibility."
"It is the only Parliament in Europe which can have a direct relationship with the European Central Bank and which already has a direct relationship with Ecofin."
"This Parliament can exercise democratic control over the euro and the institutions which determine its success or otherwise."
"On this side of the House we are determined that role will be carried out in a very hard-nosed way."
"We call on the Council to look seriously at the proposals coming forward from Parliament to give the euro democratic legitimacy."
"The attitude of the British Presidency in supporting the right of this Parliament to give its view on the recommendations of Ecofin on which countries should be in the first wave of EMU has given a clear message of democratic commitment for which we are very grateful."
"I hope now that the President-in-Office will press his colleagues to support a democratic euro."
"This presidency occurs at a crucial time - I have said it if the Foreign Secretary did not."
"It carries with it the hopes of those concerned for the future of Europe and, in particular, for our young people."
"We wish it well."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for your statement and more specifically, for your promise that you will listen to the voice of Parliament."
"You reminded us that your presidency will be marked by two historic agreements."
"On the 30th of March the negotiations with the eleven candidate countries will start and during the first weekend of May the decision on the euro will be taken."
"These historic steps have been provided for in agreements, and have been prepared in the European Council for a long time."
"They illustrate once more how the European Community has been able to function on the basis of a gradual and continuous process in which patience but also determination are the best and most secure driving forces."
"Also, Mr President, once the course has been set, you will be responsible for setting and settling the agenda, and also and particularly for creating the political climate."
"You spoke of the transparency of your decisions just now, and the plea to public opinion."
"I think that during your presidency the support of the people will be a key element in the countries where the euro will be introduced, but also in the candidate countries, who finally want to belong to a community of free and democratic nations."
"The European Community's decisions have never been as concrete and as influential in the daily life of our fellow citizens as they are now."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we know that the British tradition, permeated with its sense of democracy, attaches much value to the participation of everyone in big, collective decisions."
"That is why it is paradoxical that your government has announced that it does not wish to belong to the first group of Member States who will introduce the euro."
"Jean Monnet said of the British: we realize that you respect facts, not hypotheses."
"History proved him right, when he predicted that the United Kingdom, after a long period of hesitation, would put itself up for the ECSC and the EEC once these two communities achieved their first successes without changing anything in their federal principles."
"I, for my part, have confidence in your pragmatism."
"Because once the euro is seen to be a strong, stable, attractive currency, your country will join as well, and contribute to its image."
"We expect your presidency, during a delicate phase in which fundamental formal decisions will turn over quite a few old habits, to use all its talent and energy to convey a message of hope and trust to the entire population of the Union."
"Because, ladies and gentlemen, each new day confirms our conviction that, in defiance of scepticism and resistance, the euro will materialize."
"This is a new opportunity to safeguard the standard of living of our people, and a new opportunity for the growth of our economy, an absolute condition for the creation of new jobs."
"The hope for sustainable peace on our continent has never been this close and this strong."
"Which is why we have to convince our fellow citizens that they should look forward with generosity and with thanks to the enlargement with central and eastern Europe."
"And during the Summit in Cardiff, in mid June this year, the first steps towards the reform of Agenda 2000 will be made."
"You will have to use your creativity here to stop the fifteen from sinking into powerlessness and from dividing over monetary issues of secondary importance after the historic decision on enlargement and the euro."
"Pursuing the general interest will have to prevail over the cold defence of acquired rights, or the populism of national and class egoisms."
"That is why the basis on which the European Community was built exists."
"Common integration exists, the key to success for the European Community, giving priority to belonging to a strong unit which defends our interests in the outside world and at the same time sticks together internally, so that everyone feels involved."
"We have to continue down this road, and we support you in the actions you have announced: job creation, competitive strength, combating fraud and crime, protecting the environment and public health, culture, the information society, the launch of the planning and warning unit by the Common Foreign and Security Policy, renewal of the LomÃ© Convention, promoting human rights around the world."
"Mrs Green emphasized this, I do it again."
"Institutional reform, too, which was not achieved in Amsterdam, is an absolute must for each presidency, including yours."
"I was very moved when I recently read an interview with the former President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, who said that European Integration was brought about on the basis of the economy."
"Now we are going to tackle a second major enterprise: enlargement to include the countries of central and eastern Europe."
"' This assumes that by the year 2010 all the member countries will have the same ambitions for a unified Europe, and the means to achieve this."
"I doubt that very much."
"I fear that if we do not consider this question seriously, the European political project will slowly fade away, in favour of a huge free trade zone' ."
"(NL) We must keep this message by Jacques Delors clearly in our ears and in our brains, in our outlook, in our mind."
"I call on you, you who are characterized in your tradition by pragmatism, to make a creative effort also, and to make this European Union live during the next century as well."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I warmly welcome the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom as President-in-Office of the Council to Parliament this morning."
"I wish him every success in his presidency on behalf of the people of Europe."
"I thank him for his very extensive address to Parliament."
"I endorse the priorities of the presidency, which he clearly outlined."
"I strongly endorse the priority which the presidency proposes to give to the objective of showing the peoples of Europe that the European Union is working for them in practical ways."
"This objective will only be achieved if it can be clearly demonstrated to the majority of people that the European Union is relevant to their day-to-day concerns and that the Union can contribute to finding solutions to the problems in our society."
"The issue of most widespread concern at the present time is crime."
"There are very few people in any of our countries who have not themselves been the victims of criminal acts or whose families have not been affected by crime one way or another."
"Practically every night television news bulletins bring stories into our homes of more and more horrendous crimes being perpetrated by evil people, often against defenceless people in our society, such as young children or the very old."
"Large numbers of our people are concerned over their personal safety or the safety of their families."
"In many of our communities house break-ins, muggings and violent attacks are considered to be more commonplace than had been the case years ago."
"The underlying cause for a large proportion of these crimes is drug dependency and the abuse of illegal drugs."
"Illegal drugs seem to be readily available nowadays both in terms of quantity and variety, particularly to young people."
"The abuse of these drugs poses a serious health risk to impressionable young people who are persuaded to experiment with them."
"The drug dependency and addiction which ultimately follows for many of these people can only be satisfied through the proceeds of crime."
"It is this type of drug-related crime which is posing a serious risk to many of our communities."
"I believe that the European Union can make a major contribution towards tackling the scourge of drug abuse by concentrating its resources in a coordinated manner with the national authorities on tackling the international drugs trade."
"The illegal drugs trade is now a sophisticated international business."
"The fight against this trade, if it is to be effective, must also be sophisticated and international in scope."
"Those of us who participated in the negotiations for the Maastricht Treaty had hoped that Europol would be the agency which would provide national authorities with the intelligence and information on money laundering, illegal drug production and smuggling, which they required to prosecute those responsible for the drugs being distributed to our communities."
"Many years later I am disappointed to see yet another presidency having to list as one of its objectives that of finishing the preparations for the establishment of Europol."
"The only people who could be happy with these disgraceful delays are those involved in the illegal drugs trade."
"Nonetheless, I warmly welcome the British Presidency's commitment to getting Europol established and its interest in promoting international efforts to tackle the illegal drugs business."
"I will be supportive of any such proposals which come before this Parliament."
"During the British Presidency decisions will be made concerning those countries which will be included in the first wave of participants in the single currency."
"While I appreciate that Britain will not be one of these countries, it is nonetheless important that all countries, even those not participating in the single currency from day one, should be actively involved in the preparatory and planning phases for the launch of the euro because of the potential impact of this currency on all our economies, whether inside or outside the single currency zone."
"A critically important aspect of the launch of the new currency will be the attitude of individual citizens to the euro."
"The President-in-Office will recall the reticence, concern and even fearful response of many British and, indeed, Irish citizens to the decimalization of our respective currencies during the 1960s."
"In the lead-in to decimalization the importance of establishing a high degree of consumer confidence was perhaps not fully understood."
"I believe that the same risk exists today."
"It is vitally important that the European institutions, as well as national governments, undertake a comprehensive process of education amongst all sectors of the population and not just amongst the financial and business community, as seems to be mainly the case at present."
"When the euro is launched it will be necessary to exchange money held in present currencies for the new currency."
"This requirement may well provide a useful opportunity for the authorities to identify the assets of criminals and to take appropriate action."
"I hope that the presidency will ensure that the initiatives necessary to identify criminal assets are put in place and in good time to avail of the opportunity."
"The work programme submitted by the presidency suggests that efforts will also be made over the next six months to make progress in the negotiations on the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"Clearly the Commission's detailed proposals will need to be tabled before any significant progress can be made in this matter."
"Final agreement on reform of the CAP should be preceded by a lengthy and comprehensive debate spread over a number of presidencies."
"This reform will have major political significance, not just for our future relations with East European countries, but also for our rural areas, for food policy and for the millions of farmers and workers involved."
"Finally, the presidency has identified environmental policy as one of its priorities."
"In this regard I would hope that it will give due consideration to resolving a long-time existing environmental problem of major concern to your neighbours in Ireland - the problem of continued discharges of radioactive material into the Irish Sea from the Sellafield complex."
"Mr President, after years of bitter negativism the British government's positive attitude comes as a refreshing improvement."
"Few presidencies have won as much goodwill ."
"Few, for that matter, have organized as big a public relations campaign to generate this goodwill."
"Anyhow: welcome back, England."
"But a warning is called for."
"Good intentions are not enough."
"A presidency has to show results."
"This applies to two areas: monetary issues and foreign policy."
"The most important decision for the Union under the British Presidency is the one about the euro."
"Regrettably the British government was not prepared to state clearly whether or when England will join the European currency."
"The presidency therefore has to conduct these negotiations with one hand tied behind its back."
"Tony Blair wants to lead in Europe, but he cannot expect to lead from the sidelines."
"I would like to ask the UK nonetheless to see to it that the Member States respect the Treaty when its appoints the first president of the European Central Bank."
"According to the Treaty this appointment will run for a full period of eight years, and not for two or four."
"Messing around with the Treaty on this point could damage its credibility even before it is launched."
"Mr President, the financial crisis in Asia is casting an increasing shadow over Europe."
"Although there is no reason to panic, there is cause for serious concern."
"Devaluation in Hong Kong or China, or a financial crisis in Japan would affect both America and Europe."
"Up until now the Union, in contrast to America, contributed directly to finding solutions."
"The absence of the world's largest economic block is conspicuous."
"Why did the European Union not send a team to the countries concerned to offer political solidarity and support?"
"Of course, the Asian countries need to deregulate their economy and reform their financial sector, and the British Presidency should make this clear in the ASEAN countries and in Japan."
"But we must also express confidence in the Asian economies at the highest political level."
"This is not the time for the Union to create the impression of being introverted, selfish, and irrelevant."
"If, in addition, there is another area where there is a need for British leadership it is foreign policy."
"It is on this point above all that the British Presidency will be judged."
"There is an urgent need for effective European diplomacy in the Mediterranean and in the Balkans."
"I support the intention expressed by the presidency to make the Union play an active role in the Middle East and Algeria."
"Now that the Algerian government is not capable or not prepared to end the crimes against humanity in its country, the international community needs to consider seriously if it should set up an international criminal court for Algeria."
"This could be the most effective method for applying international pressure."
"The Union must also improve cooperation with Turkey."
"Obviously no country which violates human rights can join the Union."
"As long there is no genuine freedom of speech, and as long as children are tortured by the police, negotiations with Turkey are out of the question."
"But it is nonetheless in the interest of Europe to cooperate with Turkey on issues such as regional security and emigration."
"In March 1995 the Association Council decided to deepen the political dialogue with Turkey."
"The presidency must see to it that these decisions are finally implemented, and that financial cooperation is resumed."
"Pacta sunt servanda [pacts are there to be observed]."
"Two comments about the Balkans."
"I am getting increasingly worried that Kosovo will be the next keg to explode in the Balkans."
"Maybe it is not too late yet to prevent a war in Kosovo, but things are changing for the worse."
"It is vital that the EU and the US increase their pressure on president Milosevic."
"The international community should appoint a highly placed representative for the Kosovo issue."
"Kosovo must be one of the priorities of the British Presidency."
"My group is also asking for priority to be given to the arrest of war criminals in Bosnia."
"Nations do not commit war crimes, individuals do."
"That is why the guilty have to be tried."
"Only then can the circle of violence be broken."
"1998 must be the year in which Karadzic and Mladic are finally brought to court."
"The United Kingdom has an important military force in former Yugoslavia."
"I therefore call on the British Presidency to use all political, as well as military resources to arrive at the arrest and deportation of these two criminals."
"One final remark about the democratic quality of the Union."
"One of the ways to increase democratic control in the Union is by means of the introduction by the Council of a common electoral system based on proportional representation."
"If our European citizens wish to have this system in 1999, then the necessary decisions must be taken no later than June this year."
"This means that the presidency must make its proposals by the end of March."
"The Liberals agree with the British government's wish to bring Europe closer to the people."
"I therefore trust the British government to agree with our wish that this important democratic reform is accomplished this year."
"Mr President, my group wholeheartedly welcomes the objectives and words of the presidency."
"It will be up to the presidency to ensure that we will also be able to applaud its actions."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as you so rightly said, the decisions on the euro and the start of enlargement negotiations define the tasks and the significance of the British Presidency."
"And what can Members of the European Parliament hope for from a British Presidency?"
"We know what we hope for: a British Presidency which believes strongly in Europe today, and is tenacious, optimistic and practical, with a sense of humour as well, if possible."
"And with a Labour presidency, we must also hope (especially those of us on the left) that it has an awareness of society."
"For that reason I should like to make a few friendly comments - not at all formal - on some of the things you said."
"Because at this time of enlargement, culmination of EMU and forthcoming development of the Stability Pact, when it is going to be so difficult to implement social policies (which will sometimes be hindered by circumstances), we need to say a resounding ""yes' to enlargement, but we also need to make clear (as you did) how essential it is to combat unemployment."
"The fight against unemployment must not just consist of good intentions, but should be given the same importance as currency and the fight against inflation, which we share."
"But we need more than that."
"In order to build a balanced, democratic and just Europe, we need to maintain the great objective of economic and social cohesion, and the aspiration to a Europe based not just on liberties, but also on great equality between north and south, east and west."
"There is an obvious question: how do we achieve that cohesion?"
"What are our suggestions?"
"Well, we propose that we continue to use the structural funds in an intelligent and transparent manner, without squandering them, but maintaining that internal solidarity between northern and southern Europe. That does not have to be incompatible with enlargement policy."
"You mentioned the common agricultural policy, and I venture to say to you that we need to overcome the imbalances in aid provided for different agricultural products."
"We need reform, but a reform which helps to provide more equal opportunities for the different countries and farmers of Europe."
"If we want to fund enlargement and internal solidarity at the same time, we cannot agree with the Commission's approach in Agenda 2000."
"It is impossible to work with an own-resource limit of 1.27 % of Community GNP."
"I will speak in terms which the people of Europe will be able to understand: the Commission is proposing that out of every ECU 10, 000 of the GNP, ECU 127 should go to the Community budget."
"The European Parliament, on the other hand, is asking for a further ECU 4 for the budget out of every ECU 10, 000 of the Community GNP (that is, a total of ECU 131), so that we can simultaneously tackle enlargement and solidarity."
"How can it be impossible to use an additional ECU 4 out of every ECU 10, 000?"
"I find that incomprehensible, and I am not just speaking for myself, but on behalf of many European citizens."
"Furthermore, we want to tackle the problems of money being squandered and lack of transparency, but we support the welfare state as one of Europe's most characteristic features."
"The market should be transparent, but it should be subject to democratic values and the political and social rights of the people."
"I am sure that a Labour President must remain highly sensitive to this aim of maintaining the welfare state as a mark of European identity, through all the reorganizations and updates required by each political option."
"And to finish, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I want to say that we agree that there should be reasonable dialogue with Turkey, but from a European viewpoint, as you said."
"Turkey has to fulfil the same criteria as the other countries."
"It cannot threaten northern Cyprus, and be constantly opposed to human rights."
"We cannot accept a United States viewpoint, shaped by Turkey's importance in NATO."
"We see things from a European point of view, and we want the Council to defend that view."
"Finally, if Parliament's President will allow me, I would like to say that we are all committed to Algeria."
"Perhaps we may have slightly differing views about it, but we agree that the Troika should go there, and so should a major European Parliamentary delegation - not just to try to shed some light on what is happening, but also to promote dialogue between all those forces which condemn the terrorism and are prepared to develop an Algeria ruled by law."
"For all these tasks - for a Europe based on democracy, solidarity, and also social aspects - you can count on the support of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen and the British Presidency of the Council, I pondered for a long time yesterday evening about what comes to mind when I think about the British Presidency, and then suddenly there it was in my head, and especially in my gut: rock-'n'-roll."
"The cry for justice, democracy, freedom and solidarity, the imaginative escape from the old fug."
"That is what rock-'n'-roll is for me."
"Tony Blair's message is that time is on my side , and so talking about my generation, Mr Cook, I agree with you and you make us reflect on everything this Europe of ours needs on its long and winding road , because Europe is sick."
"Its health will certainly not be restored by a ratification of its condition or by accepting and tolerating that condition."
"Europe is sick, and the European ideal is becoming weaker because there is a feeling that combined efforts are being made to undermine it."
"Europe once stood for freedom and peace, but now the opening of its borders is seen as a danger and 2 000 Kurdish refugees are seen as a threat to order and security."
"Yes, Mr Cook, I agree with you: the divisions must be overcome, instead of setting up new barriers."
"Europe is sick."
"Ecological destruction is spreading, and it is not only the forests which are wasting away."
"Europe is sick. It is suffering from mass unemployment and a policy which talks about stability but is only concerned about money, a policy which is geared towards the euro but not towards European men and women."
"Democracy resides in the endeavour for equal opportunity, social justice, tolerance, protection and help for the weak."
"European democracy is in a sorry state when 30 million people are without work."
"People who are made social outcasts."
"People whose social decline increasingly excludes them from participating in society and politics and abandons them to their fate."
"People whose experience is a life of poverty and lack of prospects from childhood onwards."
"Those people need more than words."
"Words are all I have to take your heart away ."
"That is not enough for those people!"
"Because people have to know why they are supposed to want Europe in the first place, what is needed is a clear future perspective for the Europeanization of policies, in order to tackle problems which cannot be solved nationally on a European level."
"People do not live on money alone."
"They need work so they can earn money."
"They need equal opportunities to get work."
"They need dignity so they can believe they have an opportunity in the first place."
"Social justice is not everything, but without social justice Europe is nothing!"
"This must be the agenda for the British Presidency."
"For Europe as well as at home."
"Let no one say this is outmoded or that it cannot be done."
"France and the selfconfident movement of the unemployed prove the opposite."
"You cannot always get what you want."
"But if you try, sometimes you may find that you get what you need!"
"The EU will only become a union of all its citizens if it also becomes a social and environmental union which is committed to sustainability and based on democracy."
"Democracy is not a vision. Democracy is a matter of survival for this European Union."
"Democracy based on the principle of participation, on equal rights for all people, on respect for fundamental and human rights, rights such as the right of asylum, which only make sense when their application is guaranteed rather than their abuse being complained of."
"Democracy, that means transparency and openness, because behind closed doors principles become eroded."
"But transparency and openness do not mean big brother is watching you in the offices of friendly governments, nor do they mean Europol in my private life."
"We want an integrated Europe which is solidly established on a democratic, social and ecological Europe, and this is what the British Presidency must do."
"We can work it out, we can work it out!"
"Life is very short and there is no time."
"I promise you, I will ask you once again!"
"I thank the Stones, the Beatles and the Bee-Gees for helping me to write my speech!"
"Mr President, this for me is a very historic day because 21 years ago to the day I was the only MP still here who spoke on the first ever UK Presidency - the last UK Labour presidency."
"I notice from the Minutes that Mr Tomlinson spoke in the next debate and he is still here, but he was speaking as President-in-Office of the Council, not as a Member."
"So it is historic and I would like to start on a pleasant note by throwing a few bouquets at the President-in-Office, which might surprise him."
"The first bouquet I am throwing is because of the introduction of PR for euro elections - a long awaited improvement in our lot."
"The opting into the social policy shunned by the previous government, the promise today of opening Council deliberations, something I spoke about 21 years ago, suggesting as I do now, that EP committee chairmen be invited to Council deliberations on relevant matters: I wait to see if that will be followed 21 years later."
"It is not a case of rock and roll so much as of a slow foxtrot."
"I would like to praise also the enormous courage of Mr Cook's counterpart in government, Mo Mowlam, for her very brave actions with regard to Northern Ireland."
"I would like to praise the European noises that are coming from the front bench."
"But I start now with a criticism about EMU."
"It is an irony surely that in the moment when the decision is to be made as to who is to be in the first tranche, the UK has opted out, although it qualifies, and is not going to be in the first tranche."
"That to me is a lost opportunity."
"I would say to the President-in-Office that the train will start, it will travel well, and will it not be harder to clamber on the train once it is well in motion?"
"The Trade Union Congress, the CBI, the exporters of whom Scotland has very many, are all in favour of EMU."
"So I think that this is a great shame and I wonder if even yet it is not possible for the UK Government to change it's mind?"
"Here is what President Crosland said 21 years ago today: ' There was always in the context of EMU, a widespread hope that financial policy-making would pass from Member States to the Community and that the Community would transform from a customs union into a fully integrated economic union complete with its Central Bank, a single fixed exchange and a growing harmonization of taxes.'"
"While the UK has dithered, bereft of vision, the clock has ticked on and I think the failure of the UK to join EMU is a present tragedy."
"On the social policy side I have another criticism."
"Is there much point in getting the advantages of the social policy, which we have always supported in the party I represent here, if Old Labour's stance of defending the disadvantaged is to be abandoned?"
"Disabled, single mothers, students - there is a Euro-speak that people criticize but there is also a New Labour-speak which I criticize."
"'Means-testing' is now 'affluence-testing' ."
"'Long-termism' is meant to excuse the savage cuts of today."
"I would like to turn to some practical questions on the priorities."
"We all have our favourite environmental issues, but I would urge that we enforce the code of conduct passed by this Parliament for sub-standard tankers which threaten all our coasts and have, in fact, caused enormous damage to many of our Member States."
"On unemployment, the EMAC committee on which I served has put forward that there should be a compulsory rule about late payment."
"That really would help to solve the problems of small businesses and we should look to the very small businesses where real jobs can be created in great numbers."
"The President-in-Office did not mention fishing today."
"We have had a debacle of decades with the last government's sell-out to Spain on fishing."
"But recently we had another one by this New Labour, with the sell-out on the Fraga report."
"So, I ask the President-in-Office if he is still committed to the principle of relative stability?"
"This is the fundamental question."
"And are flag-ships to be allowed to continue making a nonsense of the whole of the CFP as it was originally developed?"
"Has he read the Duke of Edinburgh's criticism this week of the one-sided nature of fishing agreements between the EU and poor developing countries?"
"Members on all sides of this House and from all countries welcome the referendum, which must be another bouquet I throw at this government that the President-in-Office represents."
"But there is keen sadness about the broken promises: the direct relationship offered to the new Scottish Parliament with Europe has been watered down, the status of the 'LÃ¤nder' has been watered down, the right to attend meetings if the Scottish interest was dominant has been watered down."
"On enlargement, can we solve it without an enhancement of the funding?"
"I have an interest here as an Objective 1 area."
"Objective 1 is just beginning to work to redress hundreds of years of neglect of my area."
"Lastly, my 23 years here have seen the reconciliation of the old rivalries of Europe which caused war, horror and devastation and by decades of patient dialogue we have created the habit of cooperation."
"That is a habit we must never take for granted."
"(Applause )"
"Mr President, I also welcome the President-in-Office here this morning."
"I would simply say that the programme he has outlined here this morning is a very ambitious one and for my part I welcome it and I congratulate him."
"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the present United Kingdom Government on its enthusiasm."
"I just hope its enthusiasm is realistic, when one considers how much one can achieve in the very short time of six months available to it."
"I am concerned at the continued emphasis being placed on the role of the European Union in solving the problem of unemployment."
"I have made my view clear in this Parliament that I believe the only way to tackle this serious problem, which faces us all, is at national level, and closer to the people."
"While I do not oppose the involvement of the European Union in addressing unemployment, it must be realistic in accepting the limits of its ability in this area."
"What we can achieve at European Union level is better support on training, especially in the area of our young unemployed, and the retraining of those who have been unfortunate in losing their employment."
"We can also achieve more by sharing and pooling our achievements through our research and development programmes."
"I would ask the presidency to move towards the stimulation of greater research and development to emphasize its importance for the future."
"As the President-in-Office said, we are also entering into the crucial phase in the Agenda 2000 proposals."
"More especially, there is the matter of the further reform of the common agricultural policy, which is in great turmoil, nowhere more so than in his own country, the United Kingdom."
"The ban on United Kingdom beef must be removed as it is destroying the industry."
"I trust the President-in-Office during his term of office will work for the removal of that ban and the implementation of the 'born-after date' scheme."
"On the same front, he must be positive in redressing the imbalance created by the strong pound and the fact that the UK Government has not applied for the support available to it in Brussels to enable it to alleviate the problem."
"I am impressed by the presidency's enthusiasm in environmental protection."
"Despite progress, pollution remains at unacceptably high levels."
"We in Europe have attempted to face up to our responsibilities by positive action."
"We must now persuade other countries outside the European Union to accept their responsibilities."
"The President-in-Office has a tremendous challenge ahead of him."
"I wish him well and look forward to working with him closely in that challenge."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, it is quite difficult for a Member to comment when he has only just heard a speech."
"It leaves no time for consideration."
"I will give you but a few impressions, the first of which relates to the imprecision of your stated intentions with regard to the themes mentioned: you wish the countries of eastern Europe and Cyprus to become members; you wish to see a Europe of full employment; you wish to see a safe, drug-free Europe; you want a pollution-free Europe, both its water and its air; you want to see an end to terrorism in Algeria."
"But then what?"
"Let us look at these questions a little more closely."
"I note that the President-in-Office set the objective of participating in the privatization of the economies of eastern Europe."
"This is a significant and perilous objective."
"I must note, ironically, that it is quite amusing to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs of a Labour government sounding the death knell for the statist economic theories of which his own party was for decades the eulogist."
"I say this with the best of intentions, for the benefit of Mrs Green."
"In reality, as the examples of Switzerland or Norway show, it is not the European Union that creates prosperity but a free economy."
"Regarding the accession of Cyprus, it will not be able to find a solution to the political situation there by itself."
"If a solution is not forthcoming prior to accession, membership, far from bringing about peace may, in fact, risk bringing about war."
"With regard to unemployment, the President-in-Office has limited himself to a dramatic assessment and a quite explicit wish."
"The remedy for this situation is, however, already known."
"We must have the courage to confirm that the absence of reasonable protection for the European market with regard to the importation of products produced under conditions of social dumping in the rest of the world is one of the causes."
"Either we achieve a coherent regional grouping based on preferential treatment for Member States only, or we immerse ourselves completely in free trade on a world scale."
"The one and the other are completely incompatible."
"On an international level, you have mentioned your movements, Mr President-in-Office."
"I am only sorry that you are starting with Washington."
"I am not saying a visit to Washington is not needed, only that you should not start there, because of the risk of giving your other contacts the impression that our policy tags along behind that of the United States."
"Finally, with regard to Algeria, I am quite surprised that we need to send parliamentary missions as if our secret services had not already got enough information on the subject."
"I would like to restate that all these events started when the victors of the first round of the first free elections in that country for thirty years were imprisoned."
"Mr President-in-Office, I believe that your policies are based on good will."
"Good will may earn you appreciation around the world, but it is not the basis of good policy."
"Mr President, the last time that Britain held the presidency of the European Union was in the second half of 1992."
"Then the British Presidency was characterized by drift and vacillation, by lack of purpose and absence of vision."
"This time it will be different, very different."
"The British Labour Government has a clear, well thought-out agenda, as we have heard this morning, an agenda which is designed to make the essential link to the peoples' concerns and aspirations and European cooperation."
"Europe should not be about remote bureaucracy and abstract theories."
"Europe should be about joint approaches to common problems."
"It is about tackling the issues which affect the lives of ordinary people in all the Member States."
"It is because the British Government recognises this that the British Presidency is, I believe, so determined to pursue the priorities which have been outlined."
"Quite rightly, at the top of the presidency's agenda is to reach agreement on which countries will qualify for Stage Three of economic and monetary union."
"A successful start of the euro is in everybody's best interests."
"Also at the top of the agenda is job creation and if there is any issue weighing heavy on the people of Europe it is surely the fact that there are over 18 million people unemployed throughout the Union."
"There can never be a true European Union when we have such high levels of unemployment."
"Unemployment causes personal misery, it undermines social cohesion, it eats at Europe's very soul."
"What we have to do is to take forward the employment guidelines agreed at the Luxembourg Job Summit so that we have concrete action plans."
"Plans which will turn good words into practical deeds; encouraging entrepreneurship, promoting education, training and life-long learning, improving employability, increasing equal opportunities."
"This is what is needed and I am sure that this is what the British Presidency will promote with vigour and with determination."
"If Europe it to succeed in the global economy, we cannot be complacent or conservative."
"To win in the world we have to make the process of change a way of life."
"To be competitive we have to be innovative and to be innovative we have to be radical and forward-looking."
"This means that we have to create a more effective single market, a market which, for example, embraces telecommunications and the energy sector."
"It means ending unfair state aids."
"It means encouraging small businesses and attacking red tape and it means ensuring that research and development is at the very cutting edge of our economic advance."
"Another priority for the presidency is to launch the process of enlarging the European Union."
"Let us be clear that this is of tremendous importance to all the people of Europe."
"Enlargement will bring real benefits to both the existing Member States and the aspiring members."
"It will bring mutual economic rewards and deliver greater security and stability."
"But, as we all know, for enlargement to work, the European Union itself has to change."
"Agenda 2000 is a good starting-point."
"Now we have to have a serious debate about how we can develop a new regional policy to meet the needs of the future, and how of course we are going to reform the common agricultural policy."
"If modernisation is needed anywhere it is here."
"The emphasis which the presidency will place on enlargement is, I believe, indicative of how the presidency wants the European Union to look beyond its current borders."
"In a similar vein the presidency should be congratulated on its determination to improve the Union's common foreign and security policy, the emphasis which it is placing on agreeing an new negotiating mandate for the LomÃ© convention, and on its desire to give human rights the attention which is required."
"The British Presidency has indeed set itself an ambitious agenda."
"It includes a wide range of issues, issues about which people are desperately concerned."
"In my experience the international menace of the drugs trade is undoubtedly one of those issues of greatest concern to the people of Europe and I for one warmly welcome your commitment, Foreign Secretary, to take up this fight in earnest."
"It is indeed heartening to hear also your commitment this morning to work with the European Parliament."
"I can assure you that the European Parliament is more than happy to work with you."
"Partnership, consensus, cooperation are our joint words, we share a common approach to Europe's development."
"Finally, I wonder if I could conclude with a personal note."
"At the end of the presidency the European Summit will be held in my constituency, in Cardiff, the capital city of Wales."
"I am delighted that this will be the case and I am confident that at the end the presidency we will see a Europe which is more confident, a Europe which is more dynamic, a Europe which is more relevant and a Europe which once again has the full support of our people."
"Let us all work together to ensure that the Cardiff Summit is the people's summit."
"Mr President, we very much welcome the opening of the British Presidency of the European Union."
"Although the Labour Party has changed its mind six times on our membership of the EU since we joined 25 years ago, for the last few years it has been fairly consistent."
"I hope the UK Presidency will be a great success."
"Before I come back to the presidency, I should just like to deal with one or two remarks made by Mr Cook in his speech."
"It is extraordinary that he should talk about bringing the European Parliament closer to the people when his government is about to impose a system of proportional representation on the United Kingdom which is, as I understand it - and we are still waiting to find the definition - a closed list system."
"Although this is relevant to the European Parliament and although I know that Mr Cook is a long-time proponent of PR, would he agree with the attitude taken by his colleague, Mr Straw, the Home Secretary, that the electoral regions will be very large, and that it is highly unlikely that an individual candidate will be known by more than a fraction of the electorate in that region?"
"Voters cannot, therefore, be expected to make an informed choice between candidates of the same party."
"That in itself speaks volumes about the Labour Party's attitude toward the European Parliament."
"I should also like to say that the fact that two Members of the European Parliament have now to leave the Labour Party in order to speak freely, one sitting with the Communists and one with the Greens - one who told me this morning that he was expelled by fax - suggests to me that the control-freak tendencies of the Labour Party are now becoming known to people in Europe as a whole."
"I would add that, since we are all concerned about candidate selection, quoting from the Conservative Party's own manual on candidate selection, it says: ' Edmund Burke's words still hold good today."
"Your representative owes you not his industry only, but his judgement and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion."
"Authoritative instructions, which the member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey, though contrary to the dearest convictions of his judgement and conscience, are utterly unknown to the laws of the land and against the tenor of our constitution.' The Conservative Party will stand by those principles, unlike the Labour Party, which..."
"(Murmurs (of dissent) ) we understand, will allow the National Executive Committee to make the rankings, the order of the list and the selections in toto , in secret and impose those candidates on the United Kingdom."
"(Murmurs (of dissent) )I am going to return to the presidency because that is what I am expected to speak on."
"Conservatives largely agree with the government's priorities for the presidency: enlargement, jobs, cleaning up the environment and the fight against crime."
"These are all important policy objectives that we too would have put high on the agenda."
"We hope progress will be made on enlargement."
"It is a historic challenge."
"We have a moral duty to embrace the people of Eastern and Central Europe who lived under a cruel and alien tyranny for so long."
"Enlargement is in all our interests because it will dramatically increase the single market."
"Indeed, one of the many reasons why the Treaty of Amsterdam left so much to be desired was its total failure to get to grips with this challenge."
"On enlargement, Labour has a clear objective for the presidency and the setting of a detailed timetable for those applicants in the first wave."
"I hope they succeed, despite the fiasco of the treatment of Turkey at Luxembourg."
"Britain's record on jobs is far better than the European average."
"Unfortunately, Labour's approach to this question is likely to lead to more unemployment, not less."
"Any party that can contend that signing up to the social chapter and the regulations made, and to be made under it, increases flexibility in the marketplace does not deserve to be taken seriously."
"Europe needs to tackle head on the unpalatable truth that unless we cut our social costs and free up our labour markets, we will be out-priced and out-performed by the rest of the world."
"Unacceptable levels of unemployment will persist."
"Red tape and regulation are luxuries Europe can no longer afford."
"I have been distracted during the course of this address."
"I have had far more reaction from this Assembly than Mr Cook did earlier on."
"His speech was heard in almost total silence."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, undoubtedly the European Union will experience in the next few days and in the near future a period of great change and major challenges: the euro, the enlargement, the application of the Treaty of Amsterdam but also the definition of a more appropriate and courageous political and institutional framework, at least I hope so!"
"In these six months we will be embarking on the first negotiations for the reform of the structural and cohesion funds and for us this is a very important task given that the changed conditions in many regions of the Union, often for the worse, require particularly great attention."
"It will also be the six months of the start of the measures decided by the special Council on employment, six months in which the Member States must produce their plans of action for the Cardiff Council; we trust that British pragmatism will be able to banish dangerous demagogic solutions for achieving the urgent employment targets we have set ourselves."
"We also trust that, with the same pragmatism, the British Presidency will be able to strive to bring to completion the operational rules of the internal market, by which I mean that deregulation and simplification of the legislation will be amongst the priority objectives to be pursued."
"I think this will be the real help which we can and must offer to our citizens, to whom in fact the British Presidency seems to want to direct particular attention."
"I wonder if the presidency could not also convince the national governments of the need for general simplification of the legislation which is burdening citizens, firms and civil society in general."
"Finally, we agree with the timetable of activities and initiatives of this six months according to the legislative programme which this Chamber has already debated, above all for the intention expressed by the President-inOffice of the Council, Mr Cook, to take serious and determined action against drugs."
"But in concluding I must call on the Council to ensure that more decisive and strong action is taken to deal with those emergencies which, as such, are not predictable in a legislative timetable."
"I refer to those aspects of foreign and security policy which often find both our respective countries and our Community institutions unprepared."
"The absence of the Union or its serious delay in dealing with problems like refugees, genocides, international tensions and conflicts in general, are no longer tolerable in a Europe which we want to have a strong and solid presence in the eyes of world public opinion."
"So we also draw the attention of the presidency to the advantages of continuing without delay a serious and responsible Mediterranean policy which can contribute stability to the regions and develop our relations, recalling that this Parliament will also start a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary forum as soon as possible."
"As a Member of this Parliament, as joint leader of the UPE and as a European citizen, I sincerely wish the British Presidency the will and the wisdom to give a strong impetus, more than just a nudge, to Union policy thanks precisely to the proverbial Anglo-Saxon pragmatism, now that Albion seems to have converted from initial Euroscepticism to become a convinced and loyal Europhile."
"I myself, being responsible for the international institutional reports of the Mediterranean Laboratory Foundation am happy to make available the results of the second Euromed civil forum, which the Foundation held in Naples last December after having collected the testimony from Spain of Barcelona 1995, and I obviously remain available for an official presentation to the Presidency of the Council and trust that in future above all the Presidents-in-Office, like the other Community institutions, will also give continuity of attention and support to the action of the Euromed civil forum."
"Mr President, I welcome the statement by the President-in-Office."
"The United Kingdom is neither a large state nor a small one."
"It is a middle-sized Western democracy with a complicated historical legacy."
"It cannot regain the glory on the world stage which it once enjoyed."
"But where it once thought of power, it can now think of responsibility."
"The President-in-Office's speech offers hope that is the new United Kingdom approach."
"Britain's new approach to Europe will be welcomed in this House."
"Britain has been notorious for governments - Labour or Conservative - who have believed that the Atlantic is narrower than the Channel."
"That belief has kept us first out of the European Community and then for years on the periphery of its affairs."
"But if the UK is eager to join in, to show leadership, then we must recognize that you cannot lead from behind."
"The decision not to join the single currency at the start is one much regretted by my party."
"If the United Kingdom is so keen to make the single market function properly, to get people back to work as the President-in-Office says, it should put its money where its mouth is."
"Liberal Democrats welcome the importance that the presidency has given to Europe's constitution."
"If the Presidentin-Office wants to connect the people of Europe with the European Union, we must open the Council of Ministers to public scrutiny."
"We must allow Parliament to develop to its full democratic potential."
"The President-in-Office is personally extremely well placed to do this."
"As a compatriot of mine, he has suffered from the pantomime of misleading Druidic nonsense which passes for a British Constitution."
"European Liberal Democrats welcome the UK Government's proposals to reform the electoral procedure in the UK to give us a House where all Members are elected on a common principle."
"The President-in-Office spoke of restoring people's faith that the EU can speak and act for them in the world."
"It is a pity he did not give longer to the ethical foreign policy he has spoken of at home."
"At the helm of the Union, the UK is uniquely well positioned to deliver a powerful moral punch."
"The code of conduct on arms exports of which the President-in-Office spoke sounds too much like codes of conduct everywhere which are observed mainly in the breach."
"We need a legally binding EU arms export code and we need the establishment of a permanent international criminal court."
"We must not let the torturers go unpunished nor lose hope that we can change the course of history, and that the 20th century in which our weapons technology has made the argument of force easier than the force of argument and has brought such human misery, can give way to a 21st century in which the power and the imagination and the skill of Europe can be harnessed to create a stable, just and peaceful world."
"Liberals in this House wish the presidency well."
"We recognize there is a fresh wind in the highways and byways of the UK, in the main streets of its villages and towns and cities, and that there is in it the warm purpose of the British people to make a constructive contribution to the building of Europe."
"As Gladstone said, you must trust the people."
"Hope makes a very good breakfast but a rather poor supper."
"We in this House will watch the presidency closely to ensure that it has the courage of its convictions."
"Mr President, Robin Cook, there are good things in the presidency's programme on openness and quality in legislation, but the task - and the opposition - are so great that it will not succeed unless the presidency insists on new methods."
"As far as openness is concerned, the presidency should secure the support of seven other countries in the Council to change the Rules of Procedure so that every meeting and every document is automatically open unless a 2/3 majority on the Council decides otherwise."
"Thus it would be those who wanted to close a meeting or a document who would have the burden of proof."
"The principle was adopted unanimously in Parliament's Committee on Institutional Affairs and is included in the report by our New Labour colleague who presided over the sitting, Mr Martin, which was adopted by a large majority in this Chamber."
"The biggest problem today has to do with the quality of EU legislation."
"EU legislation is impossible to understand for ordinary voters."
"An EU law typically consists of a directive or a regulation and then a long list of unreadable amendments."
"You never know whether you have got everything. The presidency should insist that no more amendments are made to existing laws, but that the amendments are presented in a special script in a compiled and consolidated edition."
"Every department which needs an amendment will thus be forced to make the legislation accessible to people other than those who have specialist legal departments in Brussels."
"And the existing body of law, comprising 20 000 directives, regulations and other legislative documents will be halved simply by recording the amendments separately."
"You could then go further by compiling laws on the same subject and thin out the legislative jungle."
"Finally, about decentralization."
"If there is to be decentralization in Brussels, each rule should include an automatic lapse after, for example, five years."
"Thus, in order to continue a law would have to again..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, after listening to Mr Cook's statement - and I thank him for its clarity - I would like to be able to repeat what was affirmed recently by the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair, in an interview given to the Financial Times, namely that the British Presidency represents a great opportunity to demonstrate that the United Kingdom intends to play a constructive role in Europe and for Europe, and an opportunity to demonstrate that the agenda of economic reforms for monetary union is proceeding."
"I want my good wishes to convey this message as well, in the hope that the United Kingdom will carry out a constructive role in this six months of presidency."
"I believe, the days of British anti-European feeling are long gone; the era of Labour seats left empty in this very Chamber after election by direct universal suffrage is long gone."
"More than historical, the episode must be considered emblematic of a certain ideological approach to politics."
"The historical processes, as in this case, cannot be suffocated by sectarian and factious attitudes and it is an irony of history - and we are delighted at this - that today it is the Labour leaders who are giving us assurances on the constructiveness of their action to the advantage of Europe."
"This constructive role emerges from the fixed priorities of the British Presidency and in particular from the hoped for success of economic and monetary union, from the start of an authentic Union foreign policy, from the struggle against organized crime and from the defence of the environment."
"We are sensitive to this commitment for the definition of a common foreign policy and we give all our support to initiatives to end the Algerian carnage which tragically continues to strike tens of thousands of innocent victims."
"The presidency will achieve much if it succeeds in seriously committing the Union against the expansion of fanatical and murderous fundamentalism and contributes to bringing peace to a friendly country linked to us by cultural, political and economic ties and establishing authentic values based on the defence of human rights."
"The list of things to be done was long and has touched the various sectors of activity of the Union."
"Just two comments: the first is about the preparation for enlargement of the Union."
"Let us act in such a way that the reform of the agricultural policy does not involve penalizing zones and regions privileged because the fruit of the work of centuries gives typical and noble food products."
"The second concerns the reform of the structural funds which should not negatively strike zones and regions already burdened by serious social problems resulting from structural situations and the economic crisis."
"In both cases the risk of deeper crisis is real and the populations would not understand the operation of the Union as compared with the aims of regional policy."
"These fears and doubts also betray uncertainty and incomprehension on the part of the citizens, which characterize this phase of the construction of Europe."
"The single currency, which we want to be a federating instrument, raises fears in reality."
"The United Kingdom itself, although operating in favour of EMU, has already decided not to form part of the first euro platoon."
"Why? Our voters are wondering."
"This uncertainty is born of the fear of the potential risks without the Union having the political instruments to face up to any eventuality."
"In any case the question that we are asking, Mr President, is what European Unionism needs to become a reality, and what is still needed to achieve European political union?"
"We have to give an answer to this question!"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as an Austrian - and indeed my country will be the successor of the British Presidency - I thank you Mr President-in-Office of the Council for your clear statements, for a people's Europe, a Europe which wants to draw nearer to its people and citizens and a Europe which treats jobs and the environment as priority issues."
"But as a foreign policy speaker for my group, the PSE group, I would like to deal with two trouble spots close to us, but which affect us quite specifically in our own security interests."
"I should like to call upon you Mr President-inOffice of the Council, and urge you, to do what you have often announced, today as well in this house, to demonstrate a high level of commitment in influencing developments in the Middle East and Algeria."
"This is not a question of interference, but the legitimate participation of Europe in the shaping of a collective environment, in the preservation of our inherent security interests."
"The Middle East, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is certainly also a central element of your presidency."
"The peace process has unfortunately been interrupted."
"The European Union is paying an awful lot of money, most of which - and this is not our fault - is ultimately having a negative result in Palestine."
"We ought no longer be the paymaster following the motto of Europe pays and others - particularly the United States - deliver, as is the case in Bosnia and the Middle East."
"I would like to fully support your efforts, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and especially your efforts at the talks in America, to encourage the Americans to develop a stronger partnership in the Middle East in the interest of peace."
"We want to support, not hinder, everything that America has done."
"But we also want to do something else, Mr President-in-Office of the Council: with our efforts in the Middle East and Israel, but also in Palestine, we must also turn our attention to human rights as well as taking up the fight against corruption."
"This must be our objective wherever our money is used."
"With regard to the situation in Algeria, the fate that country is experiencing is particularly tragic."
"Here too, we must focus on a common territory, the common economic and political interests and the control of migratory movements; but above all it is a question of a humane outcome."
"None of us should be indifferent to the shocking events in Algeria, the brutal and gruesome murders, the horror of the Algerian nights!"
"It is a mockery for the government to allege it has everything under control."
"It has nothing under control!"
"There are allegations, presumptions, that sections of the government and sections of the military are directly or indirectly behind these murders."
"We have no proof, merely anonymous statements."
"This makes contacts and discussions in Algeria all the more urgent."
"We from the Parliament will have to take the same action as you."
"It is our sisters and brothers who are being murdered there."
"We must not be indifferent to that!"
"We must do everything to prevent it continuing."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the European Union the spring of 1998 is of crucial significance."
"The course is now being set for the third stage of economic and monetary union."
"Central features of this are the question of the group of participants, the fixing of the exchange rates between the participating Member States and the personnel heading the European Central Bank."
"On 25th March the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute will submit their reports on which Member States fulfil the stability criteria on the basis of the statistical data then available."
"The deliberations of the European Parliament and the parliaments of the Member States will subsequently commence in April."
"In Germany the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, and probably various regional assemblies as well, will submit their comments."
"So in this sense April of this year is the month of the parliaments."
"At its meeting on 1st May, on a Friday, after the bourses have closed, the Council of Ministers for Economic Affairs and Finance will adopt a resolution on its recommendation as to which Member States should belong to the smaller grouping of the monetary union ."
"In the morning of the following day, 2nd May, a Saturday, the European Parliament will give its opinion on this proposal at a special sitting."
"This special sitting of the European Parliament is necessary because the Treaty expressly prescribes that the Parliament must render an opinion on the Council's proposal."
"The final decision on the group of participants will then be taken in the afternoon of the same day at the meeting of the Heads of State and of Government of the European Union."
"Consequently, on the evening of 2nd May it will finally be certain which Member States belong to the smaller grouping of participants in monetary union ."
"However, the schedule for monetary union also envisages two further resolutions being adopted over this weekend."
"On the one hand this involves the final fixing of the exchange rates between the currencies of the participating Member States, and on the other hand determination of the identity of the President of the Central Bank."
"Therefore the finance ministers, whose activities are as we know not subject to entertainment tax, will probably meet again on Sunday, 3rd May in order to finally determine the bilateral exchange rates and to submit a proposal on the personnel for the managing board of the European Central Bank."
"Since the Maastricht Treaty the European Parliament has been directly involved in personnel decisions relating to the appointment of the President, Vice-President and the other members of the managing board of the European Central Bank."
"The Maastricht Treaty granted Parliament these rights, which were formulated according to the prototype of comparable rights of the Senate of the United States and which have no prototypes in the parliamentary tradition of Europe."
"The procedure for the appointment of members of the managing board is precisely laid down: proposal by the Council, opinion of the European Parliament and finally the decision by the Heads of State and of Government of the countries belonging to the smaller grouping of the monetary union ."
"The envisaged hearing of the candidates will take place within the relevant committee of the European Parliament during the week from 11th to 14th May, and the European Parliament will probably put its opinion to the vote on 14th May."
"The Heads of State and of Government of the participating countries will then make their final decision."
"This means that the managing board of the European Central Bank will be in place at the conclusion of the British Presidency and that the Central Bank will be able, as envisaged, to begin its work in the second half of the year."
"This week four German professors appealed to the Federal Constitutional Court against monetary union with the objective of at least postponing it if not completely abandoning it."
"Constitutional experts have ascertained that the media interest in this legal action is inversely proportional to its prospects of success."
"The Federal Constitutional Court will merely have to examine whether the entry criteria, as contained in the Maastricht Treaty and the appurtenant Protocols, are fulfilled."
"In this connection it has expressly allowed the institutions of the European Union scope to assess, evaluate and forecast the situation."
"The German Federal Constitutional Court could only make a negative decision about Germany's participation in the monetary union if the Heads of State and of Government were to be in violation of the Maastricht Treaty in their decision about the participating countries."
"However, since all participating parties are determined to adhere to the Treaty in all its details, we need not be troubled by such legal actions; they will not be successful."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I must be the only MEP today representing the oldest ally country of the UK speaking here."
"We have been allies since John of Gaunt, and so we know the British well and understand their way of thinking."
"I would like to thank you for the new position you have adopted, but I should also say very clearly and very frankly that the British Euroscepticism has also helped Europe to reform in many ways."
"I want to be sincere in what I say!"
"The truth is that Europe has not managed to change its institutions to get closer to the citizens."
"This is an undeniable fact."
"That is what is needed."
"It is also true that it has not managed to harmonize its criminal laws for corruption and fraud on financial and food matters to be punished."
"It is not enough just to talk about control."
"We need to find penalties and punish offenders."
"It is easy to talk, but difficult and not always politically correct to punish."
"I hope that the current presidency will have the courage to face this problem, which is one of the problems of greatest economic significance, to the extent that it is not just the States that have been robbed or the Union's money, but it is also a way of introducing unfair competition, which is certainly not in line with the economic model we are all aspiring to in a global economy."
"However, it has also been easy to make the countries, even the weakest ones, accept all the principles and obligations of monetary union."
"Nothing has been done with regard to a convergence of education, vocational training that actually brings the citizens closer to progress and actually makes Europe more open, more able to defend itself against the threats of a global economy."
"Finally, the common agricultural policy certainly has to be reformed, it certainly has to be modulated, but, for God's sake, Mr President, let's not sink to the depths of making junk food, which is what we are seeing in those countries which speak on behalf of consumers but do nothing for their health."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, like other groups, my group has already given its opinion on the content of the British Presidency's programme but I would also like to pass in review some of the points which seem to me significant."
"In particular, Mr President of the Council, I would have liked you to have developed and gone deeper into some of the other subjects which, to be frank, you often only touched upon, the subject of combating drugs, a subject which moreover is currently under discussion here in the European Parliament."
"I think that during the six months we will certainly have occasion to deal with our positions and have a dialogue on a subject which I think is very important, which cannot be taken lightly and which thus increasingly requires, in an increasingly integrated Europe, an increasingly single market, a coordinated approach at the European level."
"But in my speech, Mr President, I want to touch on one single point, hoping that it can be received by you and hence it can constitute another front on which to measure, in a certain sense, the British Presidency, also because it is a subject which the European Parliament has very much at heart but on which I want to complement the British Presidency, in particular its government, for the position which it has already taken as a presidency."
"I refer to the subject of the permanent criminal court, Mr President, a subject which is, as we know, in the negotiation stage at the United Nations and which this very year, at the end of the British Presidency, from 15 June to 17 July, will be the subject of an international diplomatic conference called in Rome and which must give life to the permanent criminal court."
"His government, at the last UN preparatory committee, took a courageous and important position, choosing to sustain with force not only the creation of the court, but also of a just, impartial court, not subject to the veto of the Security Council."
"You are the first permanent member of the Security Council to have assumed such a progressive position, which can be called the position of the like-minded countries. In contrast, we know how much reticence there is on the part of another permanent member of the Security Council and member of the European Union, and we also know how strong is the determination of the other countries like Germany, Italy, and so on."
"Will the British Presidency seek to coordinate the European Union to ensure that the voice of the Union should be one voice and only one voice, in favour of an impartial court effective from June 1998?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a pamphlet entitled, ""The Status of Monks' by Ibn Taymiyya."
"This pamphlet is on sale in Brussels, and also in Paris, in the rue FossÃ©s-St-Bernard."
"It justifies the massacre of the monks of TibÃ©hirine."
"The person who translated this pamphlet is Nasreddin Lebatelier: you could perhaps ask Mr Jean Michot, President of the Belgian Muslim community and lecturer at the Catholic University of Louvain, what Mr Nasreddin Lebatelier's real name is?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ignorance about Islam is tragic."
"I heard Mr Cohn-Bendit earlier talking, all in all rather like Mr Raymond Barre, who told us, ""We need a French form of Islam, an Islam where the mosque works according to the principles of the Republic' ."
"This shows no understanding of Islam at all."
"He cannot have read the Qu'ran, for there is no alternative Qu'ran."
"The Qu'ran does not understand the distinction Christianity makes between the spiritual and the material."
"There is no understanding, here, of the reality I lived through in Beirut for fifteen years, where I saw areas of the city changing slowly, where first the police, then the army, and finally even ministers were submitted to identity checks."
"In the 400 regions of my country I see the Tahl Zaatar that I knew in Beirut being created."
"It is the House of Islam which is being imposed and, furthermore, the House of Harb, but you know nothing about all that."
"A trip to Algeria probably would not open your eyes, since we have all the information here."
"A little Islamic culture would do wonders for the uneducated people of this House."
"Mr President, could I just explain to the President-in-Office of the Council that the last speech represents a very tiny minority of people in this Chamber and is not representative in any sense of the views of the European Parliament."
"I want to raise the issues of economic and monetary union and economic coordination."
"One of the principal roles of the presidency will, of course, be to guide very carefully the final phases of economic and monetary union."
"In spite of the decision that the UK Government has taken on Britain not joining the single currency in the first phase I think that the vast majority of people in this House recognise that it is the determination of the new government and of the presidency to safely and securely bring about the final phase of the EMU."
"What we are very concerned about in this House is the accountability of the European Central Bank, the role after the establishment of the EMU of that Central Bank and indeed of the euro in general."
"We would like to begin a dialogue with the British Presidency and then to follow that with the Austrian Presidency on the role of economic coordination and the accountability of that bank."
"We are very concerned that the European Central Bank will be almost beyond the touch of the citizens of the European Union."
"While the Maastricht Treaty enshrines the independence of the Central Bank, that does not mean it should be unaccountable to the people of the European Union."
"I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council if he will engage in a dialogue with the European Parliament over the next six months to ensure that we have proper accountability of the European Central Bank and to ensure that the aims and objectives of economic and monetary union will promote the objective of employment within the European Union."
"We will have monetary union on 1 January 1999 but many of us do not believe that we will have economic and monetary union on 1 January 1999."
"I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council on behalf of my group what steps can be taken during the British Presidency to ensure that it is a proper economic and monetary union."
"In his speech the President-in-Office mentioned that employment is a key goal of the British government."
"Could he explain to us, perhaps when he replies to the debate, what more can be done during the British Presidency, given that we are going to have EMU within a matter of months now, to ensure that the goals of EMU are compatible with the goals of creating more jobs within the European Union."
"We recognise also that selling the euro to the citizens of the European Union is essential."
"At a point when we are finishing the technical work of economic and monetary union, citizens in the EU simply do not understand the whole process."
"It is essential that the British Presidency gives a great impetus to the campaign of informing citizens across the European Union that this is their project, not only the project of politicians, and that it is something important to their lives."
"Therefore in conclusion could I also ask the President-in-Office to say something about the campaign that needs to be organized during the course of this year to make sure that the citizens understand the process of the EMU and realise that it is for the benefit of their lives and the future that this project is completed properly."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, at the beginning of your speech you joked that every presidency says it is facing a historic moment."
"That is true."
"But they also say something else: they promise to cooperate closely with the European Parliament at all times."
"Some of us have been here for some time now, and six months from now we will judge you by what you have done, not by your good intentions."
"However, for the time being, I thank you for those good intentions."
"Mr Cook, your speech reminded me of some of Sir Edward Elgar's compositions: nice to listen to, elegant and easily hummed."
"You say you want an efficient Europe."
"So does this Parliament."
"And on 19 November this Parliament gave a few recipes, in its statement on the Treaty of Amsterdam, which Mrs Green reminded you of today. In order to have an effective Europe, the Commission will have to be strengthened, codecision and the qualified majority will have to be extended, and there will have to be a re-weighting of Council votes."
"Mr Cook, you said you want a strong Europe, which acts and speaks in the world as one."
"That is true, and we want it too."
"And in order to achieve that, in the realm of international economic relations, you have a weapon: giving the Commission the power to negotiate, as established in the old Article 113 of the Treaty."
"You say you want to form a policy to combat drugs, because that is what people are concerned about."
"We agree."
"Let me ask you a question, Mr Cook. Do you think the report by Mrs d'Ancona (who is a member of your group) addresses people's concerns?"
"As for the single currency, you - the British Government - have the right to opt out."
"There is nothing to object to in that."
"You say there are too many risks and uncertainties, and you want to ""wait and see' ."
"Well, as regards the Group of the European People's Party, all the governments are going to take that step on 3 May."
"We are going to run those risks and meet the political cost of the uncertainties."
"You have the right to opt out, but I must point out to you that yours is a comfortable position - waiting until the risks and uncertainties have disappeared - and as with all comfortable positions, you will have to pay for it at the appropriate time."
"You spoke of tackling fraud and preventing money from being wasted."
"You are right."
"We agree, and this Parliament has always been at the forefront of that struggle. However, I do not think it is very clever to spread the suspicion that taxpayers' money is wasted in the European Union."
"Investigate it and penalize it by all means, but do not spread the suspicion."
"It is not true, anyway."
"Lastly, Mr Cook, you had much to say in your speech about cooperation, the market, efficiency and pragmatism."
"The world has changed since the days of Monnet and Schuman you said, and that is true."
"But the ideals of that world have not changed."
"Europe is not just a market, Mr Cook. You tackled that aspect back in the sixties when you formed the European Free Trade Association."
"Europe is much more than a market."
"When you, the British people, decided in 1974 to join the European Communities, by means of a referendum called by a Labour government, you joined not just a market, but an extremely important political project."
"I should like to hear the British Presidency saying more about Europe as a political project, not just as a market project."
"That is very important, because this Parliament believes that the European Union is a political project, and we do not want the British Presidency to make any mistake about that. To quote Lord Halifax, we would not like you to experience what happens to people who do not know where they are going, and therefore can end up anywhere."
"I hope that does not happen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and that your presidency is fruitful and productive for everybody."
"Mr President, Britain is assuming the Presidency of the Council at a very important time in the Union's history."
"It has fallen to Britain's lot to begin the accession negotiations with the new candidates for membership, and this time the candidates all have something different about them."
"On the one hand, there are countries which were behind what, in the cold war years, we used to call the 'iron curtain' , and on the other hand there is Cyprus."
"The histories of Britain and Cyprus were closely linked and to some extent parallel for several centuries."
"As a colonial power and later guarantor in Cyprus, Britain influenced the island's course positively but in some cases also very negatively, and it has an obligation towards Cyprus: it must begin the accession negotiations with the government of the Republic of Cyprus in the spirit of the decisions repeatedly expressed in this Chamber, as well as by the Commission and the Council, namely that a solution of the Cyprus problem is not a prerequisite for accession."
"As Commissioner Van den Broek also stressed, this means that Cyprus cannot remain hostage to the Turks for ever."
"Besides, if I have understood correctly, that is what the President-in-Office of the Council too implied in his speech."
"On the threshold of the new century, the European Union faces many other problems, but entertains many visions too."
"After the exceptionally successful Luxembourg Presidency, which proved that so-called institutional arguments for the exclusion of the smaller countries from the six-monthly Council Presidency are simply groundless, Britain has in its hands the file on employment and the obligation to follow up the excellent Luxembourg Summit."
"It must work on Agenda 2000 and give new impetus to the Union's internal and external policy, in a world which has become almost without frontiers."
"EMU is another huge chapter to which extensive reference has been made."
"And that is not all."
"Equal opportunities, policy for youth, health, culture, the environment, transport, telecommunications, agriculture, tourism, energy and so many other matters require further impetus."
"The British Presidency takes office with the good wishes of us all, for the good of us all."
"Mr President, Robin Cook started by recollecting the words of all presidents when they start; the ambition, and so on."
"It might be slightly amusing to recollect the concluding words of all presidents, namely the lament that six months proved so terribly short."
"After this wish list it is perhaps salutary to be reminded of that."
"I would like to focus on employment and social policy."
"I base myself on a brochure published by the presidency under the heading: Europe working for the people , which contains two priorities related to employment."
"The first is the so-called third way in Europe: economic reform based on employability ."
"The second is education and legislation."
"I would like to focus primarily on this second point."
"To my mind the significance of the combination of flexibility and security, a combination we here in the European parliament find quite important, is not done enough justice."
"Nor is the economic significance of a good social policy with good social rules done enough justice."
"This is not a plea for rigidity and bureaucracy; but economic reform occurs most easily and smoothly if individual people have security."
"This has been proven in various studies."
"These same studies also show, for that matter, how retraining and extra training is best achieved when people are remunerated well."
"It is a tragic contradiction; the worse someone is paid, the less their ambition to seek additional training, and the less ambition amongst employers to invest in it."
"Britain joining the Social Chapter was a great relief to us members of the Socialist Group working in the social sector."
"We saw the signing of the Social Chapter as a choice by the United Kingdom of a different model, a different model for the United Kingdom, too, with a social dialogue, and better organisation and fairer distribution of working hours."
"I call on the presidency not to let this vision be overshadowed by a too-restrictive call for flexibility and liberalization."
"Liberalization which in my country has led to a gap in health care between the haves and havenots."
"I am extremely satisfied with the fact that you wish to make more of Cardiff then a mere deadline ."
"That you first want there to be an evaluation of the national plans."
"But may I start by pointing out that Luxembourg truly meant a lot more than education, education, education, and EMU."
"Luxembourg was and is a choice for a policy mix , for a shifting of the burden on labour to other sources, and for a reorganization/redistribution of working hours."
"Cardiff should therefore be far more than gathering or even evaluating plans."
"In the follow-up of Luxembourg, attention should first of all be paid to the design of balanced economic management in the Union, and the development of a coordinated European employment strategy, including taxation."
"I sorry to have to observe that as far as those aspects are concerned, the messages from the United Kingdom are extremely vague at the moment."
"I hope some clarity will be given today."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, further to the comments already made by colleagues in my group, I should like to draw the attention of the presidency to some of the written resolutions of this Parliament in December, which are of great significance both to the Commission as well as the Council."
"In its resolution on the second reading of the budget the Parliament also formulated various criteria which are significant to the working programme of the presidency, and I should like to ask you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, whether you are prepared to comment on these today or to deal with them when the presidency participates in the individual committees."
"On the basis of the successful budgetary procedure for 1998 we said that we anticipate an informal collaboration with the Council at the beginning of the year in order to put in motion the setting of realistic common budgetary objectives."
"Secondly, we said that in view of the successful procedure for agricultural expenditure we anticipate that this procedure will be institutionalized and that we should have a discussion on this in March 1998 at the latest."
"I should also like to say that in the resolution on the working programme of the Commission we urged that on the question of the legal basis we must finally come to an agreement between the institutions, and I think that the British Presidency of the Council should also devote itself to this tiresome subject."
"I want to add that along the lines of what was discussed in Luxembourg and what has always been the view of this Parliament, preparations for the reform of the system of capital resources must also be made because this is a very lengthy process which cannot be dealt with within six months."
"In view of what we learnt in the BSE Investigatory Committee, for me there is also really something missing from what must already have been discussed in the general Council under the Luxembourg Presidency."
"It is good when you say that we want to have public debates in the Council in the interests of openness and transparency, but in the interests of positive and improved cooperation between all the institutions, and irrespective of the legal interpretation of Article 3 of the inter-institutional agreement on the right of the Investigatory Committee, I also expect the Council to formulate a declaration whereby in the future it is made clear that, irrespective of the legal interpretation of this agreement, national ministers will also say that in the interests of transparency and responsibility we will accept invitations of investigatory committees of the European Parliament."
"I would be very pleased if you would provide a positive answer to this in your capacity as President-in-Office of the Council as well."
"Two brief comments on agricultural policy."
"Clearly, here you have also presented the traditional, historically determined agricultural philosophies of the United Kingdom."
"I am very anxious to know whether during the course of your presidency of the Council you will - also in terms of the basic philosophy - manage to set in motion the necessary adjustment to the regulation of the banana market and harmonize this with the concepts your presidency of the Council has of agricultural policy."
"This will be a very exciting debate and I would add that we must be very much on the alert in this respect."
"Improvements are necessary with regard to the Agenda 2000, which the Parliament is also discussing: liberalization on the one hand, increased levies for European agriculture and at the same time a reduction of expenditure, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"This is in fact a crash course which no one can withstand."
"What we must agree on is a necessary reform, an adjustment, to achieve a smooth passage enabling the implementation of a model European agricultural policy and at the same time the realization of a consumer protection clause within the framework of the WTO."
"Mr President, concrete actions seem to be the leitmotif of British presidencies."
"That is why I have several questions for Mr Cook, to whom I wish every success with this weighty and historic task."
"First point, Algeria."
"It is quite right that the EU should reach out a helping hand, but can the British Presidency indicate how it is to chart the activities of groups from Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, who sent their aggressive plans simply from behind a fax machine in London?"
"And what is the British Presidency going to do about this?"
"Second point, the Asian crisis."
"In June last year I suggested to the Council in a written question that it should consider a special EU ambassador for the region."
"When will I get a reply?"
"This person should have long been in Asia to help solve the crisis."
"Yesterday we discussed the Transatlantic Agenda in this House."
"On the eve of your visit to Washington I ask you to discuss the future of SFOR with the Americans and to plead for audiovisual products to be given access to the American market."
"Will you be making a start on the necessary adaption of European institutions to make enlargement genuinely possible?"
"Fourth point, Turkey."
"I believe the relationship with the country should not be allowed to become secondary to the Cyprus question."
"What are you doing to lift the financial barrier against Turkey?"
"We are using Turkey as a NATO partner, but are not prepared give clarity on their chances of membership."
"Mr Cook, you wish to be concrete, not abstract."
"You have an opportunity here as far as the stability of Europe is concerned."
"Mr President, I cannot begin to express my delight at seeing the presidency here today and at noting the presence throughout this debate of Commissioner Kinnock which recalls the effective cooperation between the two gentlemen in the past - particularly, of course, in a certain leadership campaign in 1983."
"I am delighted that the President-in-Office has made a commitment to making the foreign security policy more effective."
"I would urge the Council therefore to start work now on those arrangements foreseen in the Amsterdam Treaty for making the CFSP more effective, particularly the planning and early warning unit."
"So, as soon as the Treaty is ratified we can get to work on a more effective CFSP."
"Clearly the immediate priority has to be Algeria, which seems to be a country currently drowning in its own blood."
"But we also have to recognize that we will only achieve something in Algeria by quiet diplomacy, by confidencebuilding and by developing a dialogue."
"And that, of course, is precisely what the Parliament has been trying to achieve with its hearing on Algeria and its intention to send a delegation to talk to parliamentarians in Algeria."
"That I think shows that the Parliament, when addressing questions such as these and human rights issues in general, can play a responsible and effective role."
"I would hope that the presidency would take advantage of this year, the 50th anniversary of the UN Declaration on Human Rights, to have a dialogue or trialogue with the Commission and Parliament to ensure that the European Union's policy on human rights has greater focus and coherence than it has had in the past."
"I would also urge him to pay attention to two areas which are likely to be lost in the sound and fury of other debates."
"Firstly, in former Yugoslavia we have a potentially explosive situation in Kosovo which appears to be deteriorating by the day."
"I hope the presidency can take initiatives in that field."
"Similarly, in the Ukraine, I hope that we will push for the partnership and cooperation agreement to be put into effect properly and do all we can to encourage reforms in Ukraine where the situation is also deteriorating by the day."
"Finally, I welcome the commitment to enlargement but I hope we can give attention to the European Conference because I believe it offers the opportunity for a genuine European political area which will allow us to develop dialogue with countries who are not yet ready to join the European Union or are negotiating, so that we can make them feel part of our family as soon as possible."
"I recognize the commitments to Turkey and I hope that we can bring Turkey on board, provided it is prepared to accept the ambitions and vocation of the European Union in terms of enlargement, particularly in relation to Cyprus."
"Minister, I have two minutes in which to address you."
"Ten seconds of this I will use to express my sincere hopes for the success of your six month presidency, and to acknowledge your efforts in making your country a greater part of European construction."
"That leaves me with one hundred and six seconds to mention four considerations, based on the declarations made by yourself, or your Prime Minister, today or during the last few weeks."
"The first is regarding your very commendable concern to bring a united Europe closer."
"I think that up until now we have not considered sufficiently the two notions of ""proximity' and ""subsidiarity' , which do not mean the same thing."
"The need to prioritize the issues to be resolved, and the right level of response to be provided, are more important than a Europe which, wishing to be one people, involves itself in everything on a daily basis."
"I hope that your pragmatism will enable intelligent progress to be made on this issue."
"My second observation: you want to play a leading role in Europe."
"Nobody is complaining."
"But do you not think that by refusing to be involved in the euro, and even the EMS, from the start, when your economy is in a position to do as well as, even better, than some others, that you are considerably weakening your declared will?"
"If you are too European for London but not European enough for Brussels, you must choose the path of the future with courage and, consequently, not leave others to deal with the teething problems."
"Third observation: you judge very harshly the common agricultural policy."
"However, you strongly desire a third path to be trodden between liberalism and protectionism."
"This means that, faced with globalization, which brings more advantages than disadvantages but whose logic leads, all the same, to standardization, you are in agreement that a project of civilisation should be built, a truly European project."
"Do not forget that one of the pieces of this project is a certain concept of agriculture, of rural development and of the environment."
"Fourth and last observation: in European construction, each one of the great European nations brings its historic experience."
"Often, this experience creates fears and stereotypes on the part of the others."
"The continent frequently has the impression that, in the area of international politics, for you the Channel is as wide as the Atlantic."
"Think about this, for it is you who is going to steer Europe for the next six months."
"In conclusion, Minister, if you take these four observations into account, we French will forgive you the fact that you embarked on your presidency in Waterloo."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as I have been trying to indicate all morning, we have a serious problem: we have now 30 minutes' worth of speaking time to fit into 13 minutes."
"Clearly it cannot be done."
"We have two options."
"All the remaining speakers are PPE and Socialist speakers."
"Either those with three minutes agree to speak for two minutes and those with two minutes agree to speak for a minute and a half, or we conclude the debate now with the President-in-Office."
"Would the groups agree to that?"
"I know it is not very satisfactory but these are the two options."
"The indication I am getting is that Members would prefer to have a shorter time to speak in the presence of the President."
"Mr President, I will speak rather more quickly and apologise to the interpreters."
"Mr Presidentin-Office of the Council, developments over the last few weeks concerning asylum policy in the European Union are causing us great concern."
"We recommend that your presidency of the Council pays particular attention to them."
"I recently had the opportunity to visit the Kurdish refugee camps in Italy and came to the conclusion that the official portrayal of the influx of refugees into the European Union is not in accordance with the reality."
"I say this with bitterness because the public in Europe have been given the impression that we are facing a massive flood of people coming over from Turkey and from Iraq."
"In reality this involves a few hundred people who are guarded by the Italian police and strictly controlled by the Italian authorities, and whose asylum cases are being conducted strictly according to legal and statutory regulations subject to the most stringent control and without freedom of movement."
"This is my first observation, from which I infer a second: with the constantly increasing development of the economic sphere and the constantly progressive liberalization of the internal market, there is no analogy in the European Union with regard to the legal stipulation of basic civil freedoms and its organization."
"There is no clear definition of the external borders and the powers for authorities to protect the external borders."
"Nor do we have any right of immigration in the European Union, which leads to the right of asylum constantly becoming the criterion for immigration and ultimately lowering acceptance of a basic right, namely the basic right to asylum."
"We do not need a five-year term to harmonize laws relating to asylum, immigration and external borders."
"On the contrary!"
"The events of recent weeks show that this must be brought forward."
"We would be very grateful to you if you also took this into account in your presidency of the Council."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I look forward to the new British Presidency which has a positive attitude towards further developments in the Union."
"Since 1979 the governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major have done everything to stop European social developments."
"This led to a lopsided development of the Union, and at a certain point to unacceptable discrimination against employees in Europe."
"Fundamental social rights were not applicable in the United Kingdom."
"Thankfully the Labour government has ended this, and the Social Chapter is able to operate for the Fifteen, and can be adopted in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have clearly underlined that you would like to make a success of EMU."
"For the people, EMU will be a success if, likewise, a social Union is developed."
"A social Union which upholds the principles of the social market economy, that is to say, social justice and solidarity."
"The problem of the internal market is that the social dimension is not developing fast enough and concurrently."
"I therefore fear that the British Presidency's social programme offers too few perspectives on this front."
"Too few legislative initiatives are provided to strengthen the social base with minimum standards, both on the areas of labour market policy and the social security."
"The shock caused by the brutal closing down of the Renault factory in Vilvoorde a year ago seems to have passed."
"The call for a more social Europe seems just a faint echo."
"It would be a big mistake to underestimate how urgent the need is now for a more social Europe."
"Social urgency which will play a part, when we are discussing the third phase of EMU, when we are discussing accession negotiations, when we are discussing taxes and especially when we are discussing employment, which should not merely be training, but also giving people jobs through transeuropean networks, community services, environmental investments, and so on."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, allow me to say to you: ' I was very pleased to hear that the major environmental spheres of water, air and waste are included in your list of priorities.'"
"If the British Presidency of the Council assists the European Parliament in this respect it will count amongst the progressive and successful presidencies."
"However, I would also urge you to bear in mind that what you refer to in such general terms implies integration in other spheres of policy, and that when you are considering the revision of the structural funds regulation you see very clearly that environmental policy is applied in all structural funds, and also that you keep an eye on this over the next six months and tell everyone else about it as well please."
"When I see the Commissioner for Transport nodding, at the same time I also applaud the fact that you link transport and environmental policy, because these are important spheres."
"And I will be grateful to you if you can reduce emissions of noxious substances."
"It is of course no surprise that I expect you to place consumer protection at the top of your agenda."
"You did not mention this but I know that it is close to your heart."
"So close, indeed, that on Friday I know you will take very attentive note of how the WTO panel decides on the hormone question, and will definitely ensure during the presidency of the Council that the European Union adheres to its prohibition of hormone and growth enhancers."
"I will say something else about consumer protection, and that is what everyone now expects from me: BSE."
"Of course I will say something about this."
"It is certainly a coincidence that the Commission, right at the start of the British Presidency of the Council, will consider a partial lifting of the export ban, and I know that you, Mr Kinnock, have fought particularly strongly for this."
"I am on your side if consumer protection and safety are taken into account, and I ask you, Mr President, to make it very clear that Great Britain - although, and precisely because, you have the presidency of the Council - will ensure in a completely unselfish manner that safety and vigilance are given top priority, that deception in the meat trade and other areas, for example, is combated and that you will not jeopardize the trust that you have also re-established in Europe, in the European Parliament and amongst the people."
"(Applause from the Group of the Party of European Socialists)"
"Mr President, we welcome the British Government's decision to place the fight against organized crime at the heart of its agenda for the presidency."
"Whilst all crime is disturbing, organized crime is particularly repugnant because it infiltrates and feeds off society itself."
"No civilized country and no union of civilized countries can be complacent or tolerant of organized crime, and the citizens of the European Union, in our view, have a right to expect the strongest action at a European level."
"While I do not want to pre-empt tomorrow's debate on the d'Ancona report, to which reference has already been made, I cannot leave aside the issue of drugs on behalf of my group, because we feel very strongly that the drug trade is at the heart of organized crime."
"You cannot fight organized crime unless you fight drugs."
"Therefore, as a group, we expressed unanimous and vigorous opposition to the proposals in the d'Ancona report to provide for the legalization of cannabis and the freer supply of all drugs under prescription."
"If time had allowed, I would have expanded on this aspect but time does not apparently allow."
"Furthermore, my group also supports and encourages the presidency's objectives of promoting police and customs cooperation against drugs, of finalizing the establishment of a Europol with real powers and resources, and of cutting the supply routes of drugs into the European Union."
"Our message to the Council is that it is not enough to put the right policies and organizations in place: policies and organizations must be supported, coordinated and well-resourced."
"Finally, a reference to asylum policy, on which I had hoped to say more."
"This is another area where the presidency should be more active, ahead of the incorporation of the Schengen agreement into the European Union."
"I have to leave it there but we need to make a clearer distinction between political refugees and economic migrants."
"Mr President, in the six months of the British Presidency of the Union, a series of important decisions will have to be taken as regards cooperation with developing countries."
"As well as the specific dossiers on which the Council must decide, it seems to me that there is an essential question on which it will be necessary to concentrate attention, that is the definition of the negotiating mandate of the Commission on the future of relations with the ACP countries."
"As the European Parliament already expressed by a large majority last October, the renewal of the LomÃ© Agreement assumes a fundamental importance, both from the symbolic point of view and in its concrete aspects: symbolically, because, depending on what decisions are taken, it will be possible to judge whether the commitment of the Union towards our partners in the poorest parts of the world, will either be confirmed or will be reduced or actually cancelled; concretely, because it is also from how the objectives and rules of European development cooperation will be redefined, and especially its most important instrument, which will depend a great deal on the possibility for the Union to influence the world situation positively."
"This House has already said that it would be appropriate to have, after the year 2000, a fifth LomÃ© Agreement."
"But what needs to be done, with much more consistency than in the past, is to bring into the agreement those objectives and concepts which have been affirmed in the great United Nations conferences of the last few years, as well as in our Community documents, but which have only rarely pervaded the practice of cooperation."
"The objective is that of human development, participatory and sustainable, giving force to the growth of civil society and human resources in all the southern countries of the world."
"But also important is the way in which the legitimate interests of the countries and the populations of the poorest countries are taken into consideration in the drawing up of the instruments of commercial policy and in the international economic agreements."
"Decisive is the way in which the European Union participates in the international instances, like the World Trade Organization."
"Even up to today some parts of our cooperation have had to beat a retreat faced with the supremacy of other strong interests."
"The event of the banana panel is perhaps the most significant example of this."
"The Council must pronounce itself on the new banana regulation which, as far as we know, threatens to penalize severely some of the traditional banana supplier ACP countries, particularly Somalia."
"It will be necessary to avoid this situation and make it possible to guarantee that such countries can remain in the Community banana group."
"We ask that, on all the legislative dossiers, like those on the NGOs, decentralized cooperation, human rights and similar questions, on which the presidency, the Council must express itself, the opinion of the European Parliament should be taken into due consideration."
"In general, what needs to be reconstructed is a capacity, which only the European Union can have, of developing a political dialogue and a ""strategic alliance' with our developing country partners to be able face up to the challenges of globalization together."
"Mr President-in-Office, I will not hide my astonishment from you."
"Earlier, when you were talking of the initiatives for Algeria, you did not note that the European Parliament was the first to react to the situation in that country."
"Many urgent resolution have been voted for since 1995."
"It was through the initiative of this Parliament that in September it was envisaged to send a delegation to Algeria."
"For 48 hours we undertook an examination of the hostile forces, in conditions which were, however, calm and healthy, and we have been waiting for several weeks to be able to go to Algeria."
"Now the Troika, represented for the moment by senior civil servants, is going to Algiers."
"We hope - and tomorrow morning the parliamentary delegation will meet - to be in Algiers as soon as possible, that is, 7th or 8th February next, so that we can meet with all the representatives of the political groups who sit in the Algerian parliament."
"We are assured that at this political level, which cannot be considered interference since we are discussing parliament to parliament, we will be able to make various contacts, not only with politicians, but also with civil society, and that we will be able to visit the places where people are suffering."
"I would like you to tell us, as President-in-Office, what you think about this initiative."
"Amidst the pity and overall compassion, at a time when the massacres are causing worldwide emotion, I believe it is time to recognize that Parliament has been the only institution which, for months, has demonstrated its horror, but we would today like..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, as our group leader has already said, we know very well that the Agenda 2000 debate on on the subjects of the CAP will take us into the second half of the year, partly too because there will be elections in Germany."
"However, we confirm, we cannot just play a waiting game on an issue which is, moreover, very urgent."
"Our group held a conference on the future of the common agricultural policy on 13 and 14 November."
"We talked about a new social pact to be renewed, a pact between agriculture and society, highlighting how inertia is the greatest enemy of a CAP which wants to be more modern and renew itself."
"We are concerned by the times, because since 1995, when the strategy paper on the future of the CAP was adopted in Barcelona by the European Commission, unfortunately we are still at general statements, perhaps too general and generic, on the European agricultural model."
"The Foreign Secretary, Mr Cook, has spoken of the taxpayer, the consumer and the rural community."
"These are in fact the three basic issues."
"I do not think the taxpayer should have to be faced with the dilemma of increasing the financial allocations to fund the common agricultural policy."
"It is rather a matter of the better utilization of funding that already exists for the common agricultural policy, with more targeted, more transparent aid which responds better to the requirements of protection and valorization of quality."
"This is the issue which also interests consumers."
"It is not by dismantling the common agricultural policy, on the wave of a pure and simple thrust towards savage liberalization, that the consumer is best protected, but with a policy of quality which the experience of BSE has taught everyone."
"In my opinion, Mr President, these are the fundamental points."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Algeria is a very ill country, whose illness has not been diagnosed, making it very difficult to treat at the moment."
"Therefore I think there are two basic matters which need to be tackled urgently."
"Firstly, to convince the Algerian Government that it is an absolute priority to supply all the necessary means to stop the dreadful killings of so many innocent people."
"The European Union should collaborate and cooperate towards this objective, lending all the necessary material, political and diplomatic assistance which the Algerian Government may request."
"Secondly, to tackle this conflict, we need an urgent diagnosis of the disease."
"The visits from, first, the European Union Troika, and later the European Parliament (which my colleague Mr Soulier mentioned) should help us Europeans understand a little of what is going on there."
"Algeria, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is not just a producer of gas and oil."
"It is a Mediterranean country with great human potential, which is asking for privileged relations with the European Union."
"There is a constant flow of Algerian emigrants towards Europe."
"The country's history is linked to the history of European countries around the Mediterranean."
"Its culture and religion are shared by millions of human beings."
"None of the things going on there are irrelevant to European culture, economy and society."
"The European Union and the Algerian Government should reflect jointly (within the scope of their respective institutions and powers, and with absolute respect for them) on the solution to a conflict with extremely serious repercussions for the peace, stability and development of the peoples of the Mediterranean."
"(Applause from the Group of the European People's Party)"
"I now give the floor to the President-in-Office to respond to the debate."
"Mr President, I have found this morning's debate genuinely interesting."
"A lot of very valuable points have been made."
"There has been a lot of support which I think we can build on in the six months ahead."
"I have to confess also to a private fascination in trying to figure out how some people got 1 1/2 minutes, some 2 minutes and some 3 minutes."
"As yet I have not come to an explanation of the principle but I am sure I will grasp it during the next six months."
"By my count, we have had 37 speakers in the course of the last three hours."
"I have ten minutes."
"Much as I would wish, I cannot attempt to go back through each of the 37 contributions, all of which were equally interesting."
"If I were to attempt it everybody would get only ten seconds."
"So, I shall try to summarize what has been said and my response to it."
"My starting point must be that, as I understand the discussion I have been listening to, my opening remarks got a pass mark."
"I hope I am right in saying that, though I will be prudent enough not to put it to the vote!"
"There were many warm and welcoming contributions."
"I even took as an endorsement the remarks that our presidency programme reminded one Member of rock and roll."
"Even Mr McMillan-Scott gave a welcome to the British Presidency, although later on in his speech he appeared to move reference back of his own welcome."
"(Laughter) If I do not now respond to all the questions that have been raised and the points made, please do not think that they have not been taken careful note of and will not be borne in mind in the months ahead."
"There has been a broad degree of agreement among the Members present with my opening remarks on our programme."
"First of all, I am very encouraged by the large number of contributions which have welcomed the importance we are attaching to a programme of direct relevance to the citizens and the electors of Europe."
"If we want to restore legitimacy to the European project among our peoples we have to make sure that we demonstrate how that project is relevant to the lives of our peoples."
"During the British Presidency we will be doing it by means of direct involvement of our people in the presidency."
"For instance, we have already involved young children from all across Europe in designing our logo."
"We have a scheme to send some of our young people from Britain around Europe as ambassadors for a day."
"I am pleased to say that some of my opposite numbers, such as Klaus Kinkel, have agreed to take a British student with them for a day as ambassador for a day."
"I will be watching very closely how well they do because we are always on the look-out for another good ambassador!"
"(Laughter) When we go to Cardiff - which, as Wayne David rightly said, will be a very important occasion for Europe, for Britain but also for Wales - we are also going to host an alternative summit of non-governmental organizations and others, who will be meeting for two days on the eve of the formal summit, so that they can among themselves explore the themes of a people's Europe and subsequently make their recommendations and conclusions available to the Heads of Government summit which follows."
"All of this will not achieve what we want unless we demonstrate that on issues of real substance the European Union and the British Presidency can work for the people of Europe."
"The most common point made in the many speeches we have heard in this discussion was the repeated statement that Europe must give priority to winning the war against the drugs trade and the drugs barons."
"Tragically, last year 6, 000 people across Europe died as the result of misuse of drugs - overwhelmingly young people, an enormous waste."
"Nor is that tragedy confined to those individuals."
"The prevalence of drugs in our society threatens to corrupt parts of our civil society and all of us have an interest in making sure that we contain that drugs threat."
"I give you an assurance that this will be high on the priorities of the British Presidency."
"(Applause) Also high on our priority will be the issue of jobs, which many of those who contributed to the debate also highlighted."
"Cardiff will give us an excellent opportunity both in the Council and in Parliament to review progress on those action plans that were drawn up under the Luxembourg guidelines."
"How much progress are we really making in Europe towards training?"
"How much progress towards opening up opportunities to the long-term unemployed?"
"How well are we investing and using the extra money that was found at Luxembourg to create job opportunities?"
"And how much more have we done to remove the obstacles to the single market, to open up prosperity and opportunities for our people?"
"But there is another dimension to the people's Europe."
"One of the most important benefits Europe can offer its peoples is the benefit of peace and security."
"Enlargement will be a key part of that process."
"But also, as a number of speakers in this discussion have pointed out, we must take active measures to bring stability to those areas on the borders of Europe which threaten conflict."
"I entirely share the point made by a number of speakers that the situation in Kosovo is unacceptable and deeply unstable."
"(Applause) There is no other place anywhere in Europe or the Balkans where universities have been closed for six years, and that is not acceptable in the modern age."
"The tragedy is that in foreign policy, work to prevent conflict never gets the same public attention as the reaction to conflict when we have failed to prevent it."
"That must not distract us from the importance of taking every possible step we can to stabilize the situation in the Balkans and, in particular, to avoid Kosovo spilling over into wider violence."
"As part of that general programme of promoting security and stability, I hope that in this presidency we will achieve that agreement on a code of conduct and arms licences for arms exports which a number of people referred to, so that we can have in Europe one clear, firm, common standard on the export of arms and so that none of the countries of Europe find that they take a stand on an issue of human rights only to be undercut by a partner."
"Let us make sure that we confront this very important issue together and have one common standard on human rights and on arms exports."
"(Applause) It would be right to say that one of the other most frequent themes of the contributions was the worrying and deeply disturbing situation in Algeria."
"I accept the observation made by a number of those who contributed."
"Of itself, the mission cannot resolve the problem."
"But it has to be the starting point."
"I hope that mission will go soon."
"I hope that mission will be there in time to report to the General Affairs Council on 26 January and that, from there, we will be able to take forward whatever concrete and specific steps Europe can take to end the terrorism."
"In the meantime, since I have been rebuked on this point in my opening address, let me say that I fully understand the welcome lead given by the European Parliament on this matter."
"The communiquÃ© issued at the end of the Political Committee yesterday specifically encourages more parliamentary contact between Europe and Algeria."
"I believe that is a very important part of the way of bringing Algeria to a more open, more democratic state."
"Although much was said with which I can agree and little with which I would disagree, it would be wrong of me to finish my remarks without signalling out for disagreement the observation of Mr Gollnisch on trade."
"We have to be quite clear that there is no way forward into the next century and a new millennium on the basis of reverting to the protectionism of the last century."
"(Applause) Millions of our people in Europe are dependent for their jobs on their exports to the rest of the world."
"We cannot demand free trade to the places we export to whilst insisting on protectionism for ourselves at home."
"(Applause) Nor should we regard it as a threat that as a result of freer trade in the world, other parts of the world are becoming wealthier and richer."
"On the contrary, that is our opportunity."
"So long as people remain in poverty we cannot sell them our exports."
"If they, themselves, achieve a prosperous economy then there is a bigger market for Europe and for the people who work in our factories."
"I am very conscious, Mr President, of the remarkable efficiency with which you shut up people who over-run."
"I have no wish to suffer the same fate."
"So let me draw my remarks to a close by picking up some of the observations that were made about the position of Britain."
"I come to you, not as the British Foreign Secretary. I come to you as the President of the General Affairs Council."
"It is therefore not proper for me to address or to push particular national perspectives."
"But let me say one or two things about the points that have been raised about the specific British position."
"First of all, we will pursue reform of the common agricultural policy not because it is a British policy, but because it is a matter which is in the interests of the whole of Europe, and on which we have a report from the Commission."
"(Applause) Indeed there is an encouraging degree of consensus about that reform."
"When the Agricultural Council met in November, 14 out of 15 Member States wanted to take forward the Commission's proposals."
"That is a good start on which we would want to build."
"Secondly, concerning the single currency, we have looked at the issue very carefully."
"The conclusion we have come to from our own national perspective is one firmly founded on an economic analysis, namely that we are at a very different point at the moment in the business cycle to most of the countries of Europe, and that there is not the correct convergence for us to join with safety."
"But that is not an objection of principle, nor is it in any way a criticism of those countries of Europe who wish to proceed to a single currency."
"Over our next six months in the Chair, we will make sure that we consistently act with regard to our duty as President, to provide impartial, effective and competent arrangements for those countries who wish to proceed with the single currency to do so with the best possible prospects of success."
"(Applause) We will also, of course, make sure that we do not allow any difficulties over beef to become a matter that comes between us, as presidency, and our duties as the presidency."
"Since one or two colleagues have raised it, let me respond to what has been said by saying this: we have been absolutely open on the situation regarding both the risks of BSE and the health consequences in Britain."
"Indeed, I stand before you as a member of a government which reversed the previous refusal to discuss this issue with the European Parliament."
"(Applause) One of the very first steps taken by our new Agricultural Minister was to come to the European Parliament and discuss it with the committee in the European Parliament."
"I can give you an undertaking, not just on this occasion, as President-in-Office, but also as the British Foreign Secretary, that whether as the presidency or whether as the British Government, we will seek always to cooperate and be open with the European Parliament."
"We will never ever succeed if we work against each other rather than sharing openly and frankly with each other what the problems are in the hope that we can better arrive at a common solution."
"I close with one last national thought."
"I was interested that many of the people who spoke from different countries, and different parties within those countries, nevertheless often portrayed a common national perspective on Europe."
"The British are a very open and very honest nation."
"We display our disagreements, even in front of everybody else in the European Parliament."
"(Laughter) I would hope that the British Presidency might achieve just one national objective, which I do not think any other nation in the Hemicycle will begrudge us: I would hope that the British Presidency may, by the end of it, have gone further to building a national consensus in Britain about our future in Europe,"
"(Loud applause) and that by the end of that presidency we may have a British public more content with our place in Europe, more at ease with our future in Europe, and recognizing that we can work in cooperation with Europe to our mutual advantage."
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"Thank you very much, President-in-Office."
"Thank you for your cooperation this morning and, on behalf of the House, can we wish you, personally, every success in the next six months."
"The debate is closed."
"Votes"
"Mr President, in accordance with Article 60, paragraph 2, as rapporteur I would like to request a postponement of the draft resolution."
"Yesterday, M. Bangemann, on behalf of the Committee, gave a very negative opinion on a large number of amendments. Even if he accepted some of them, the balance is, in any case, sufficiently negative for me to request a postponement of the vote."
"Of course, the vote will take place soon, but prior consultation with the Committee is necessary."
"Please note that for the four other dossiers, my request is identical, but I must formally repeat it."
"(Parliament approved the proposal to defer the vote on the legislative resolution) II. honey (COM(95)0722 - C4-0403/96-96/0114(CNS))"
"(Parliament approved the Commission proposal (as amended) )"
"I am sorry to sound repetitive, Mr President, but I am making the same request as for the previous vote, in accordance with Article 60, paragraph 2."
"To clarify, I would like to add that we voted for a request to amend the legal basis, which is in any case an important element of debate."
"I would like to insist, for the following dossiers, on the fact that the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights was given on the five Directives in September 1996, that is, at a politically different time to today."
"Everything concerning the food industry has become clearly more sensitive, and I therefore think our request is justified."
"(Parliament approved the proposal to defer the vote on the legislative resolution) III. fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption (COM(95)0722 - C4-0404/96-96/0115(CNS))"
"(Parliament approved the Commission proposal (as amended) )"
"Mr President, for the third time, I again request the implementation of Article 60, paragraph 2."
"(Parliament approved the proposal to defer the vote on the legislative resolution) IV. certain partly or wholly dehydrated preserved milk for human consumption (COM(95)0722 - C40405/96-96/0116(CNS))"
"(Parliament approved the Commission proposal (as amended) )"
"Mr President, for a fourth time, I again request the implementation of Article 60, paragraph 2, that is, an adjournment of the final vote."
"(Parliament approved the proposal to defer the vote on the legislative resolution) V. fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and chestnut puree intended for human consumption (COM(95)0722 - C4-0406/96-96/0118(CNS))"
"(Parliament approved the Commission proposal (as amended) )"
"Mr President, I once more request a postponement of the final vote."
"(Parliament approved the proposal to defer the vote)"
"Mr President, I voted for Mr Fayot's report differently from my group, because life outside Parliament requires Parliament to take a quick decision on this issue."
"Central to the resolution will be the acceptance or rejection of the document."
"I am therefore in favour of Mr Fayot's proposal for practical reasons."
"This is no precedent for how things should proceed in future."
"Regarding secondary issues in connection with the report on the third stage of economic and monetary union we would also like to deal with, the opportunities for doing so will no doubt present themselves."
"Along with my colleagues in the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, I voted against the insertion of new Article 79a into the Rules of Procedure, as proposed to us by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"My first reason for this is the numerous irregularities apparent in the text: firstly, there is irregularity in the procedure for adoption since, as I said when I put my preliminary question, the version proposed in the House is not that which was adopted by the Committee and, moreover, corresponds to the text of an amendment which was rejected by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"There is irregularity also in the very content of new Article 79a, which has been drawn up in line with the assent procedure - already anticipated in Article 80 of the Rules of Procedure - and not as a compulsory consultation as anticipated by Article 109 j of the EC Treaty."
"Furthermore, the parallel that can be made with the usual consultations of the European Parliament is illuminating."
"In fact, the consultation of the European Parliament foreseen in Article 109 j, paragraphs 2 and 4 of the EC Treaty, is a compulsory consultation of a particular type, in which the European Parliament is requested to give its opinion to the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government, on the conclusions presented in the form of recommendations by the Council, that is the ""Ecofin' Council."
"In this doubling up of groupings within the Council, the ""Ecofin' Council, in relation to the European Parliament, is playing the normal role of the Commission and the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government."
"The terms agreed by the European Parliament in setting its consultation procedure should have, as with the normal legislative consultations of Parliament in the process of Community decisions, expected a report containing an explanatory statement, along with a proposal for a legislative resolution advocating approval or rejection of the Council's ""findings in the form of recommendations' , or proposing amendments to those recommendations."
"Similarly, the possibility of tabling amendments to that proposal for a resolution should not have been ruled out."
"This solution is so logical that - and this is revealing - it is the very one which the European Parliament adopted on 28th November 1996, when it gave its opinion to the Council, meeting in the composition of Heads of State or Government, on the recommendation drawn up by the ""Ecofin' Council in accordance with Article 109 j, paragraph 2, of the Treaty. It was then a matter of the decision to postpone the date of entry into Stage Three of economic and monetary union."
"The appropriate Committee had made a written report, drawn up by Mr Alman Metten and including a proposal for a resolution. Twelve amendments were tabled in the House."
"How can you accept that what was allowed at the time of the decision postponing the implementation of the euro should be refused at the time of the decision - fundamental for the countries of the European Union - on its implementation properly speaking?"
"This is a flagrant violation of the basic rules of democracy by the majority in our Parliament, who often decry the lack of democracy in the European Union and who ceaselessly demand more democracy in many countries around the world."
"Moreover, when it is consulted on a text comprising a number of recommendations, Parliament must be able to express itself, to amend, add, remove, and it is the right of each one of its Members to be able to amend these recommendations and to vote separately on each one of them."
"As from today, I wager that when the time comes, Parliament will regret having taken such a strict position that forbids any discussion on the ""Ecofin' Council recommendations because of the obligation to accept or reject them as a whole package."
"These recommendations could, for political reasons, be quite different from the positions taken by the Committee, on which Parliament will have had time to give a detailed opinion without the Treaty anticipating this."
"The European Parliament, which is normally concerned to uphold or even extend its prerogatives - in particular in relation to the Council - has therefore adopted an extremely paradoxical position."
"Our group are not satisfied with this, and will do all it can to ensure the preservation of parliamentary rights."
"The report on inserting a new Rule 79a, presented by the chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, Mr Fayot, has been the object of prolonged and deep discussion within the committee. As a result, wide agreement has been reached, but this is not shared by our Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"In contrast, the majority position by far (which produced the wide agreement necessary for its approval) was that Parliament's plenary debate should be based on the oral presentation of a proposal by the relevant committee, with no opportunity to present any amendments."
"Our group has decided not to present Parliament with the amendments we fought for in committee, because we think agreement has been reached with regard to another procedure which, although it allows the European Parliament to deliver an opinion, does not do so in the manner and with the hierarchy which we think are necessary."
"Therefore, although we have decided not to present Parliament with a series of amendments which we knew in advance would be rejected, and although we realize that Mr Fayot's proposal gives the European Parliament a procedure by which to deliver its opinions, we have decided to abstain."
"This is because we think that procedure is inadequate, and we believe abstaining is the best way to indicate our overall position."
"There is no reason to depart from the Treaty and change the Rules of Procedure just because a timetable has been drawn up which forces such changes in order to be able to take the decision on the euro as planned."
"It would be meaningless to talk of the independence of Parliament if we could not make any amendments or propose split voting."
"If the Treaty could be circumvented so easily in this case, it would set a precedent for also doing so in other contexts."
"on the Ford report (A4-0400/97)"
"We voted for the Ford report on changes in the Rules of Procedure in order to make the work easier for Parliament's delegation in conciliations with the Council."
"The report involves minor improvements of a practical nature."
"At the same time, however, we would underline our fundamentally critical view of the procedure itself."
"The conciliation procedure means that a central part of the actual legislative process takes place behind closed doors in the form of negotiations."
"That is contrary to fundamental democratic principles, according to which lawmaking should always be done in complete openness and by elected representatives."
"I have voted against Mr Ford's report for the following reasons:"
"It does not relate in any way to the question raised by Parliament on the need to increase the number of Vice Presidents from three to five, as raised by the President, Mr Gil Robles, on suggesting the amendment to Article 75(3); this amendment was deemed to be the fundamental requirement for the distribution of votes made by the President and applied since the beginning of the second part of the Legislature."
"On making the detailed amendments to the other articles of the Rules of Procedure, leading to a request for the President of Parliament's opinion, the report shows the hypocrisy of changing something so that it includes everything."
"Consequently, the appointment of two more Vice Presidents by the President who, in practice, will not have any duties on the Conciliation Committee, is meaningless."
"Besides the obvious discrimination in having Vice Presidents to perform the same duties, some by the first and others by the second, in this case irrespective of the nationalities of the new members proposed by the President, which never seems to have been the original intention of the President of Parliament, it must be noted that the overall solution presented is the result of the collective pressure exerted by several MEPs who are sometimes involved in conciliation and who do not want to lose the opportunity they occasionally get."
"And also, irrespective of his competence in the office of presidency of the Conciliation Committee, the report reflects a reaction of defending the fortress and the inertia of the status quo which the chairmen of the most important political groups do not have the political desire to oppose or even clarify."
"In these terms, the Ford report is an important report for the statistics of the Committee on Government and the rapporteur, but is no of no importance whatsoever for the future of the institution."
"on the Lambraki report (A4-0001/98)"
"The Swedish Social Democrat Group has abstained from the vote on this report."
"Our basic position is that the common agricultural policy must be fundamentally reformed."
"However, this report proposes an increase in subsidies, although it concerns a very limited area."
"The proposal means an increased burden on the EU's budget of around ECU 30 million per year."
"We are afraid that a subsidy trap is being made for the producers concerned."
"on the Filippi report (A4-0002/98)"
"The Swedish Social Democrat Group has abstained from the vote on this report."
"Our basic position is that the common agricultural policy must be fundamentally reformed."
"This report concerns details in the area of rice production."
"on the Chesa report (A4-0003/98)"
"I think that the common agricultural policy must be fundamentally reformed."
"This premium for the abandonment of wine-growing areas is also very dubious."
"Paying grants which lead to nonproduction does not necessarily guarantee that production will cease."
"It can be moved, changed or return etc."
"I am abstaining from the vote on this report because I do not think that this abandonment project can be regarded as a good use of money."
"on the Cabrol recommendation (A4-0004/98)"
"We have voted against Mr Cabrol's report on a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community."
"Mr Cabrol wants to replace the proposed network between the Member States with a permanent structure at EU level."
"The rapporteur also wants to standardize the Member States' methods and definitions in this area."
"We regard this as the expression of an unnecessary centralism."
"A direct cooperation between the Member States in network form should be sufficient to solve the problems which arise in this area."
"Today the Danish Social Democrats voted for the report on the surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community."
"We believe it is important that there is cooperation in this area because of the many diseases which do not respect formal national borders."
"Nonetheless we doubt that an actual EuroCentre for communicable diseases is the correct way to go, unless such a centre fully fits into the international picture."
"A EuroCentre which operates independently of WHO, for example, cannot be worth very much."
"The aim here is of course a good one, namely the setting up of a centre for the control of infectious diseases."
"However, I am very sceptical about the value of constantly setting up new institutes at 'Community level' ."
"Sweden has already developed networks for this purpose, including cooperation with WHO."
"If a network is to be set up in Europe, then it should be a pan-European structure."
"These constant new EU institutions require resources, and these resources have to be taken from somewhere."
"The positive choice of an EU institution may therefore perhaps require negative decisions at the national or global level, especially when we remember the negative attitude towards taxes in the Union."
"on the Cabrol report (A4-0406/97)"
"Cases of asthma have been on the increase, and the cause of growing mortality, for the last twenty years."
"There is a human, economic and social cost to this."
"The most recent medical statistics collected by the World Health Organisation suggest that the increase in asthma is largely linked to the environment and to allergic factors in the atmosphere."
"It all combines to cause an outbreak of the illness when these conditions encounter an hereditary predisposition to the illness."
"As a doctor I can say to you that it has today become essential to look into this problem."
"This is what the Cabrol report recommends, when it considers the different human, sanitary and economic factors linked to the reduction of solvent emissions."
"The ten million jobs affected, in more than 400 European businesses covering nearly 20 different sectors of economic activity, are physically able to adapt to lower emission standards than those currently acceptable."
"This is why it is important to harmonize emission levels in this area for all the Member States and for all companies, whatever their size."
"If the implementation of this is not strictly enforced, we will leave the field open to the commencement of unfair competition, disguised as subsidiarity or support for SMEs."
"I will therefore vote in favour of the Cabrol report, especially as the delay in transposition and application within different national legislations will enable, through its flexibility, an adaptation in time according to the efforts already initiated by companies for the protection of workers, users and people."
"As a parent of asthma sufferers I welcome the production of this report and many of the proposals that it makes."
"Volatile organic compounds and other industrial solvents contribute to the formation of ozone at ground level."
"This unfortunately intensifies problems for those suffering from asthma in particular, but it also contributes to headaches, eye problems and heart disease."
"I therefore support Mr Cabrol's proposals to amend the Commission proposals."
"He is correct when he rejects the Commission proposal to exempt those Member States which have drawn up national plans."
"Harmonization on an EU-wide basis is the more correct approach."
"It also ensures a level playing field and prevents unfair competition."
"I hope that following today's vote Member States will move quickly to implement its proposals, even in advance of the October 2007 deadline."
"Rejection of application 40 to amend is completely unreasonable for SMEs."
"Therefore rejection of the overall report."
"This directive has been created on the basis of a real need to reduce emissions of so-called VOCs."
"Especially in regions with a lot of industry it is an important task for public health to combat air pollution, and a task I can support."
"The fact that VOCs also contribute to the destruction of the ozone layer and so lay us open to serious climate changes, only makes the need for action even greater."
"On that basis, however, it is worrying that by implementing this directive we would subject small businesses and regional authorities to a long list of administrative burdens, the effectiveness of which we cannot be sure of."
"In my opinion there are problems with basing controls on spot checks because in that way you punish the businesses which carry out thorough inspections and so have a greater chance of finding breaches of limits."
"I think we should consider whether the control and administration set out in the directive are cost-effective and whether there are not possible alternatives."
"The destruction of the ozone layer is a transnational problem."
"That is why it is good that we are looking for common solutions to the problem of emissions."
"However, we must also bear in mind that the emission of volatile organic compounds has regional consequences."
"In areas with a lot of businesses which use these chemicals, the discharge contributes to creating smog with its subsequent health problems."
"Against that background I can only support the Commission's proposal that individual States may draw up their own plans to reduce this pollution."
"The problems are not the same all over Europe."
"As long as we stick to the requirement of a reduction in discharges, it is advantageous to allow the authorities which are close to the citizens to find the most effective methods."
"I warmly support the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection's Amendments Nos 2, 17 and 20 which point out that there are also health aspects connected with the emission of VOCs."
"We must not forget that people who work with organic solvents on a daily basis are exposed to a large health risk."
"This directive will also improve the everyday life of these people."
"I would therefore like to request that the reduction of emissions takes place by finding alternative products."
"Mr President, in the reply to our contributions yesterday to the Lannoye Report and in particular to the proposal concerning honey, Commissioner Bangemann replied that it was not the objective of labelling to settle questions relating to the quality of the products, or even measures to support the beekeepers."
"I must say that I was rather amazed at these statements because I - perhaps I am naive - have always assumed that the objective of labelling is actually to inform the consumer, including information about quality and origin."
"If this occurs the consumer is indeed automatically informed about the quality of the product."
"This then implicitly supports the high-quality honey of our beekeepers and the protected designation of origin, which the Commission indeed itself publicises with expensive advertisements and glossy paper."
"A good use of European tax monies moreover, especially as the Commission also urges honey to be accorded just as much respect as St. Ambrosius."
"This is implicitly a measure which can help to ensure that enough bees continue to be kept, thereby guaranteeing the valuable occurrence of pollination."
"I am very pleased that colleagues here have lent such massive support to our applications, in order to ensure that the consumer can still distinguish between the high-quality agricultural product of honey from our Member States from the cheap imported honey of inferior quality."
"I am also pleased that Mr Lannoye and the Parliament have resolved not to put the legislative decision to the vote."
"We are therefore now spared from what happened to me with my report on the improvement of the production and marketing of honey in June."
"Actually the Council completely ignored the fact that we had unanimously adopted 22 applications and my report here."
"A few days afterwards it adopted as Point A the regulation in a downright undercover action, as the Commission had recommended to it."
"In September I then discovered in talks with agriculture ministers that most of them had no idea that they had rejected our proposals."
"(Interruption by the President)"
"As I value your presence in this House, I have granted you twice the allocated speaking time."
"But please, do not take advantage of that."
"I am not taking advantage."
"I simply wanted to tell you, Mr President, how the Council of Ministers has dealt with our amendments."
"I did not want to mention it yesterday as I did not have any speaking time."
"When it is a matter of important problems concerning nature, the environment, production, we have no speaking time."
"We have time to spend on everything that goes on in the world, except concerns of interest to our citizens."
"There, Mrs Lulling, I can see that you are touching on a serious matter, but you will have to fight within your group and within the other groups for that to change."
"I am obliged to enforce the Rules of Procedure."
"Unfortunately."
"It was you who voted for the Rules of Procedure, not I!"
"We voted against the resolution because we think that questions of sport are outside, and should remain outside, Parliament's and the EU's areas of competence."
"Mr President, as the initiator back in December of the demand for a Commission statement on this matter of the withdrawal of a place in European competition from the winners of the Coca-Cola Cup, and author with my colleague, Tony Cunningham of the Socialist Group Resolution, I am delighted that Parliament will be backing the Football League in their dispute with UEFA."
"UEFA's action threatens the well-being of dozens of football clubs in the UK with the prospect of the Coca-Cola Cup losing successively: interest, spectators, television coverage and sponsors."
"Why?"
"As a punishment for the failure by the premiership to toe UEFA's line on the size of the division."
"But the Coca-Cola Cup is run by the Football League not the Premiership."
"This is absolutely illogical and clearly at odds with Community law respecting abuse of a dominant position."
"Football is a sport, but it is also an important European industry."
"It cannot escape the consequences of European legislation."
"The sooner UEFA wakes up to this fact the better it will be for them, football and its fans."
"on the Souchet report (A4-0410/97)"
"The most important details are dealt with in recital B and chapter 8, which requests less asymmetric and unequal relations with the United States. This is in particular true on a commercial level, but also in the areas of security and defence."
"I have my doubts regarding recital H which congratulates the European-United States cooperation in the area of the crises in ex-Yugoslavia and the Middle East."
"In our opinion, the United States has no role to play in the former Yugoslavia, which is a European issue in the broadest sense of the word and not an American one."
"As far as the Middle East is concerned, we condemn the policy followed by the United States in Iraq, which will end up starving the civil population."
"Finally, if it is true that there are common values between Europe and the United States, then there are also differences between the two: classic European humanism must be defended against a society exclusively based on money, which is too often the case in the United States."
"Furthermore, it seems necessary to include eastern Europe, the Orthodox religion, including Russia, closely in the destiny of Europe."
"The strengthening of ties with the United States is only justified if, at the same time, there is a strengthening of ties with eastern Europe."
"If not, the world will be unipolar and exclusively dominated by American power."
"I will abstain with regard to this report."
"The extensive changes which the international landscape has been through since the 1980s have also changed the relationship between the EU and the USA."
"The constant American flavour which has characterized most of the post-war period is no longer accompanied by a systematic willingness to intervene in the event of crises in Europe."
"The new American attitude requires greater European independence."
"The report recognizes the new situation, but also establishes that there is still a need for close cooperation across the Atlantic with a view to ensuring peace and stability in the world and respect for values like democracy and human rights."
"The differences of opinion between Europe and America relate in particular to the areas of economics and trade."
"As the rapporteur so rightly points out, the EU and the USA will work on reducing these disagreements to a minimum."
"I am delighted at the adoption by the vast majority of this House of the report I presented on future relations between the European Union, its Member States and the United States of America."
"The success of transatlantic economic dialogue, which will from now on be at the centre of our relations with the United States, seems to me to be dependent on a number of conditions."
"It is first of all essential that Europeans are able to discern and clearly formulate their own interests."
"It is also essential that common Euro-American interests are clearly, relevantly and realistically defined, that they are concretely identified and that the themes for dialogue are the object of a rigorous and concerted effort to define them."
"The two partners will from now on have to show themselves capable of making progress in the satisfying of these interests through dialogue, in particular regarding the question of the remaining obstacles and that of the optimal management of the numerous frictions that such an interweaving of interests necessarily implies."
"The management of disagreements is one question which will have to be tackled frankly and deeply, not limiting it to a simple warning mechanism."
"Success in transatlantic dialogue also assumes an active participation of Member States and business circles."
"Without such participation, this instrument risks being put to the better advantage of Americans than Europeans, given the important differences in the nature and way of functioning which separate the European Union from the United States"
"The characteristic of transatlantic dialogue is that it is necessary to be better armed than the others in the tackling of all subjects, including the most sensitive, whether it be a question, for example, of financial services, of social or environmental standards, or extra-territorial legislation, which are factors of legal insecurity for foreign investors."
"It could be considered that these different issues have, until now, been carefully avoided within the more recent and more delicate dialogues that the United States have embarked upon, in particular within the context of APEC or the Americas Summit."
"Transatlantic dialogue can only be truly profitable if Europeans are able to defend firmly and cohesively the interests they identify in common."
"Our American partners are able to defend their national interests pugnaciously."
"They expect us to do the same."
"This is why the Commission must make extremely sure that there is a strict reciprocity in concessions, a symmetry of allowed advantages and a globalization of negotiations when concerning issues of foreign trade relations with the United States."
"It is also essential that the European Union is able to have at its disposal permanent instruments which are likely to form, if necessary, a credible threat of reprisal with regard to our partners."
"Finally, given the essential role played by the American Congress in the area of foreign policy, and in particular foreign trade policy, interparliamentary dialogue with the United States assumes a particular importance: if managed well and firm in the decision to tackle all subjects, it can play a very useful role in reciprocal direct information and conflict prevention."
"If all of these conditions are met, we can anticipate a good future for the new transatlantic dialogue."
"That concludes Voting Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Continuing training"
"The next item is Mrs Waddington's report (A4-0405/97), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission report on access to continuing training in the Union (COM(97)0180 - C40208/97)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since today is a special one for the UK Presidency it is appropriate to quote from a statement entitled 'Partners in Europe: Learning and Working together' the first words are that 'Success in promoting employability and tackling unemployment will be a key test of whether the EU is making Europe work for people."
"Employability is vital both for a competitive labour market and to provide people with security of employment by equipping them with the education and skills they need to adapt to a changing labour market' ."
"It is therefore very timely that the European Parliament and the Commission are now studying a report on access to continuing training which was produced as a result of the Council recommendation in 1993."
"That recommendation identified 15 areas where it was felt that Member States needed to take action to encourage the development of access to training."
"However, the Commission's report produced as a result of this recommendation does not provide us with the data which is necessary to determine if progress has been made, nor does it assess the impact made by the European Training Programmes and the structural funds resources on the development of access to training and its impact on employability in Member States."
"The report in the main simply provides examples of best practice collected from Member States in 1993."
"In fact the latest statistical data that we have on participation by European adults in training was produced by Eurostat in 1996."
"Eurostat examined training participation of people aged over thirty during a four-week period in 1996 and they discovered that only 3.6 % of Europeans had been involved."
"There were considerable inequalities of access and this evidence of inequality is backed up by many other studies."
"People who gain access to training are much more likely to be employed, to be in professional or managerial jobs, to be younger and more highly qualified, to be Northern Europeans and to work for larger companies."
"There is, without doubt, clear recognition by the European Union, Member States and the social partners of the need for greater access to education and training for adults in order to increase employability, job security, flexibility and competitiveness."
"It is therefore necessary to address the issues of low and unequal levels of participation in training and to determine measures that should be taken to make progress."
"Here the Commission has a vital role to play."
"The report from the Employment and Social Affairs Committee contains some very concrete proposals which are within the Commission's powers to implement and I believe that the European Parliament expects the Commission to take them up immediately."
"In summary, the Commission should present proposals for a common set of qualitative and quantitative indicators in order that a monitoring system can be established on access to training across the EU, to measure progress and provide benchmarks."
"Secondly, action research should be undertaken to assess the quality and quantity of training available to unemployed and underqualified workers, including older people and those in a typical and insecure employment."
"Thirdly, a dissemination strategy should be developed so that successful initiatives taken by Member States and those taken with EU resources can be shared more effectively."
"The Employment Committee is suggesting that 'showcases' of good practice should be presented at education and training fairs across the EU."
"Fourthly, pilot projects to encourage individuals to assess their future training needs and receive guidance and to enable firms to develop their skill forecasting systems and training plans should be established using European resources."
"Fifthly, and very importantly, the work and programmes and forward planning of the Commission in the fields of training and employment need to be coordinated."
"This could and should result in a concerted approach between labour market related programmes such as the European Social Fund and training related programmes such as Leonardo da Vinci."
"In future training at EU level should not be considered in isolation from other employment related issues such as work organization and job creation."
"Finally, it is time for the social partners to conclude a framework agreement on access to training."
"They must be encouraged to do so, since there is considerable agreement between them on the need for progress and the Luxembourg Job Summit has provided them with a further incentive."
"However if the social partners fail to make progress, the Commission should bring forward proposals of its own without delay."
"Really there has been no better time for the EU to seize the opportunity to work with Member States and the social partners to make life-long learning a reality for European adults, the employed and the unemployed."
"The UK Presidency has promised to concentrate on securing progress towards adaptable labour markets which are responsive to economic change and on ensuring that individuals can acquire the skills they need in a modern competitive economy."
"I believe that the recommendation of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee on access to training provides an action plan and some new ideas to make progress a reality."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this almost seems like the midnight sitting which is to follow later, but I do not wish to draw any conclusion from this about the significance of our subject."
"In the Committee for Culture, Youth, Training and Media we formed an opinion on the report of our colleague Mrs Waddington, and of course we see a few other key points and perhaps we view one aspect or another differently."
"One thing seems important to me: on the question of access to further training, a distinction must be made between two areas, namely on the one hand the area of job-related assistance, so to speak, i.e. the development of skills which serve to advance a career in the occupation already being pursued, and on the other hand measures aimed at qualifying someone in order to be able to succeed amongst the competition as well as on the labour market."
"In this connection, in our report we also referred to those women who, because their careers are structured differently, sometimes do not fit in the same way into the pattern on which the overall trend is based."
"I should like to share the rapporteur's criticism of the paper submitted to us by the Commission."
"It is also my complaint that no clear structure is discernible and that although a collection of individual examples can certainly provide one suggestion or another, this ultimately fails to create a basis which can be further developed."
"There is one point which we from the Committee for Culture, Youth, Training and Media - and which is also referred to in our own application to amend submitted by my group - would like to stress; it relates to something also mentioned by the rapporteur, namely that one must have a certain amount of skills to actually take advantage of offers which are made."
"Therefore, we in the Committee for Culture, Youth, Training and Media consider it particularly important that as early as the basic training stage the ability to continue learning, pursue lifelong learning and develop own initiatives is taught so that available offers can be taken advantage of with real effect."
"With regard to the evaluation of quality and quantity, we should also like to point out that there will certainly always be categories of occupations for which there is greater scope for further training and others for which this opportunity cannot be provided to such an extent, for example in markedly practical activities. So the focus should not only be on the cognitive sphere, but other spheres should be incorporated as well."
"We thank the rapporteur for her work and hope that the suggestions fall on fertile ground at the Commission!"
"Mr President, as draughtsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights I am pleased with the Waddington report."
"The majority of the Commission's proposals have been incorporated into the resolution in close consultation with the rapporteur, and I thank her for this, and in close consultation with the Committee on Social Affairs."
"The constructive criticism of the Committee on Women's Rights concerns particularly the following points:"
"Firstly, we deeply regret the fact that in the European Commission's report no survey had been held within a number of sectors which are so very important to women, such as public administration, health and education."
"Secondly, too little attention has been pad to access to training for part-time and other flexible workers."
"We regret this, as it largely concerns women."
"We would like to see an intensive target group policy, with special courses, amongst other things, aimed at women."
"Thirdly, women in small and medium enterprises, and female entrepreneurs must be given more attention during professional training and life-long learning."
"Women must be encouraged through targeted training to start their own businesses, and ta take full advantage of new technology."
"Finally, the European Commission is always talking about mainstreaming and there some good plans on the table, like the one on the integration of equal opportunities in general policy."
"I wonder why then, when reading the evaluation report, I get the uncomfortable feeling that the focus on women's training opportunities is primarily founded on arguments like ageing or demographic factors."
"Just like men, women are a valuable human resource who should be used now, and they should be given opportunities for training and life-long learning."
"We believe that as long as women have a disadvantaged position, positive action is needed."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for, as usual, a well drawnup and very good report."
"Society is changing ever more rapidly."
"In the old industrial society it was the person who owned the money who had the power and influence."
"In the new society which is emerging, it is increasingly the person who possesses knowledge who is also going to have power."
"In the old society power was unequally divided between those who had access to money and those who did not."
"There is also a risk of such an inequality in the new society, if we do not ensure that everybody benefits from education."
"That is the most important issue."
"Education is going to be increasingly important."
"If we are to have an equal society in future we must ensure than everyone, men and women, those who are now poorly educated, the unemployed and others can share in the education society, can share in basic education and can share in life-long learning."
"That is one factor."
"The other factor is that we must ensure that when we obtain an education we obtain one which can be used for a long time."
"There has to be a broad basic education, because society is changing ever more rapidly."
"It is not possible to have a quick education."
"Furthermore, there has to also be life-long learning."
"Working life and education must be fully integrated."
"Both society and the social partners have a responsibility in this work."
"Society has a responsibility by providing sufficient resources, by creating an active labour market policy, by creating a tax policy which encourages education and by creating a social insurance system which also provides the opportunity for education."
"The social partners have a responsibility, because in future it will not be possible for people to simply sit down and negotiate about loans and general terms of employment."
"It will be increasingly important to include education as part of the negotiations."
"I was myself responsible for a report a month ago concerning changes in the organization of work."
"There are clear connections."
"The most important question if we are to develop new organizations of work is to have a welleducated workforce, and a workforce with a broad education, because organizations of work are going to have to be changed according to the needs of the time."
"So a workforce is needed which is also capable of meeting the needs of the new era."
"Finally, I would once again like to thank Mrs Waddington."
"These are excellent proposals, concrete proposals on best practices , on using the structural funds and on improving the statistics."
"I hope that the Commission listens to them."
"Mr President, I must firstly offer the rapporteur my very sincere thanks."
"Her task was not easy, but she managed it very well."
"Access to further vocational training is of crucial importance to all employees."
"Conversely, well-trained employees are the basis for commercial success for every employer."
"Completely inadequate information and obsolete statistical data cannot form reliable bases for a good and meaningful analysis."
"To this extent the Commission's report is unfortunately not very informative."
"On the other hand, the Commission has presented no evaluation at all of the contribution of the joint programmes in its initiatives."
"Although on a European level the social partners are in agreement about the factors which are significant for the promotion of access to further vocational training, but unfortunately there is a serious difficulty because there is no agreement about the measures to be taken and the implemental levels."
"Further action must therefore be taken here because this makes it difficult to establish common prerequisites and the performance indicators proposed by the rapporteur."
"In the relevant training programmes the financing of pilot projects must definitely be taken into account."
"The measures should in particular include women as well as small and medium-sized companies."
"Information events with the participation of the social partners could in fact represent useful aids."
"A coordination of the projects in the particular sphere of employment with those in the sphere of further vocational training is required."
"A framework agreement on the opening of business enterprises for vocational training is certainly desirable."
"However, I would venture to doubt whether our own assessment and advisory services, which would again incur costs, are absolutely necessary."
"Allow me to point out a danger."
"In the opinion of the social partners the recommendations of the Council in 1993 on access to further vocational training unfortunately scarcely had any effects on developments in the Member States."
"And in the opinion of the ETUC there is only a very limited number of successful examples."
"This means that the lack of reliable and stable structures and mechanisms is hindering successful work in this area."
"The social partners have so far failed to agree as to whether a Directive is necessary."
"This must be considered in detail, and it is also a question of subsidiarity."
"This question therefore involves the principle of subsidiarity."
"There are still some hurdles to be cleared for a successful implementation of the guidelines to this report They must, however, be overcome forthwith in the interest of employees and employers."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I of course would also like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done, as well as the rapporteurs of other committees, who have come up with good issues."
"I would like to ask a fundamental question, however."
"I wonder whether the European Commission is able to manage this major problem in the right way."
"We are dealing, in fact, with an issue of subsidiarity."
"Competition policy is on the tip of the tongue of some very highly placed individuals in various Member States."
"I have a feeling that the degree in which it is thought that education can be used to a certain extent in competition policy, plays a part in the dissemination of information."
"The reports by the Member States contain too little information."
"On that front, the European Commission has also failed to monitor a number of issues, such as government, health care, education, and life-long learning."
"We do not really have any information on these."
"When we look at the Eurostat figures we have to conclude that people working for big companies have a lot more opportunities for training paid for by the social partners than those who work in small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Strategies should be developed together; the European Commission working together with the Member States."
"In my opinion too much is still missing at the moment."
"Maybe following the Employment Summit a few things can still be done on this front."
"We are talking about employability ."
"If there is one thing which will give people the opportunity to return to the labour market and to allow them to be more competitive with people who have completed the right training, it is life-long learning, and the attention it is given."
"It is the responsibility of the Commission to get the Member States to put aside their own interests in favour of the general European interest."
"I call on the Commissioner to give this point in particular more substance."
"Mr President, Mrs Waddington has once again succeeded in producing an excellent report on an important issue."
"Opportunities for adult education and training are becoming more and more vital with ageing populations and increased demands at work."
"The report also states that training must be targeted at women, the unemployed, the poorly educated, and older workers."
"I myself would like to remind everyone particularly of the right older employees have to further education and training."
"A 45 year-old person is only pretty much half-way along his career path, and is therefore worth investing in."
"The over-45's have generally had a poorer education than their juniors."
"This is worth bearing in mind."
"Another group it is difficult to cater for as far as further training is concerned is people working in non-standard employment relationships, of whom most are women."
"These people particularly need to be better trained so as to prevent the permanent division of workers into two main castes: skilled workers in steady employment, and the reserves, picking up the scraps as and when needed."
"Mr President, I would like to join in the congratulations for Mrs Waddington's excellent report."
"I would like to congratulate the whole of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, partly on this report and partly on the report which we adopted a few months ago concerning life-long learning Both of these reports are very important."
"A lot of good things are written about life-long learning, about further education and about education in general."
"There is no great disagreement about the necessity and value of further education."
"This issue has also come very much into focus now in connection with the summit in Luxembourg where people also discussed and focused on how important further education and labour market training are."
"However, reality looks a little different."
"We can really question whether education has improved."
"We all know that basic education is a precondition for people to be able to benefit from further education."
"But still there are daily cutbacks in basic education in schools."
"There are, for example, teacherless classes and a shortage of school materials."
"The classes are too large, so pupils who need help to learn reading, writing and arithmetic cannot get the help they need."
"These pupils are therefore already excluded when they leave school."
"I would like to stress that we all have to accept our political responsibility when it comes to safeguarding a good basic education as a precondition for being able to take advantage of life-long learning."
"Where the social partners are concerned, as is taken up in the report, it appears as if their discussions about the level at which decisions about further education should be taken have stalled."
"I am a bit sceptical about the wording of paragraph 15, i.e. that if the social partners cannot reach agreement, then they will be overridden and a directive will decide what level this should be."
"I do not believe that is a good way to proceed, because it will become apparent that countries, or societies, which do not invest in further education and good education are the major losers."
"I think that is also clear from the report."
"Mr President, on the basis of the document from the Commission and the Waddington report, this debate on access to continuing training in Europe needs to be considered on three levels, economic, social and cultural."
"In the face of the tragedy of unemployment, to which we all give priority, we should more closely examine what the expressions ""race for competitiveness in the world market' and ""intensification of competition' mean."
"In fact, behind this debate there is another more fundamental debate on the very concept of the world market, the common market, the single market, linkages with the world market, a debate which needs to be held."
"What kind of market economy do we have?"
"What market economy do we want?"
"Do we want it more in keeping with the culture, with the personal and social interests of our different countries?"
"I do not unfortunately have time to go into this issue in depth."
"For the moment, I would like to follow up the interesting comments contained in Mrs Waddington's report on a particular point."
"With this in mind, I address myself to the Commissioner, who was not insensitive to this point when I expanded it in her presence two years ago, in the Committee on Women's Rights."
"If it is normal to take into account a break in the careers of mothers wishing to return to the job market, the ""re-entrants' as they are called, to use a rather ugly word, then the problem of young women - and this is the point you were open to, Mrs Cresson - who marry young and have children after having started training, even when they were sometimes about to finish that training, should also be taken into account, since they find themselves totally excluded from all the proposals mentioned precisely because they are married and have brought up their children."
"Is this not an injustice that should be rectified?"
"They, too, have a right to continuing training."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in our modern giddy-paced industrial society lifelong learning is an absolute must in order to master the new challenges constantly facing everyone."
"This trend is most clearly visible in the world of work where the completion of further vocational training courses and the acquisition of specialist skills is a prerequisite for the professional advancement of the individual, but also for the maintenance of the company's competitiveness."
"It is a political responsibility to secure access to vocational training and further training and to make it equally available to everyone."
"It is not good enough for further vocational training to be reserved only for those who are already the best and most highly qualified."
"Must we not rather also offer employees with a low level of training opportunities to acquire further training to give them the chance of a longterm job and open up prospects of advancement?"
"And must we in particular not also take women into account, who often have to curtail their careers in any event as a result of the additional burden of family/occupation, by paying attention to their needs and integrating them better into further training?"
"Governments are therefore urged to point out these defects and adopt measures to counter them."
"Only through widespread information about further training opportunities and promoting further training by creating and extending occupational incentives and by removing all access restrictions can further steps be taken against increasing unemployment and social peace be maintained."
"Mr President, I congratulate and thank our rapporteur, Mrs Susan Waddington, on an excellent report characterized - as Susan's work is always characterized - by completeness, perspicacity, and political and social sensitivity."
"We are talking about vocational training, its efficacy and its democratic development, in other words about how it can be made accessible to all Europe's citizens, as it should be, and worthwhile for them all."
"That effort should be made not just to be of use to us in our own countries or to ourselves in the European Union as a pretext or an alibi, but as a substantial ingredient of a sincere and bold effort to combat unemployment."
"New and ambiguous terms are becoming current, such as employability, adaptation, flexibility of labour, terms which are of our times but which need to be freed from sinister connotations and defined clearly, because it is natural that in a climate of unemployment such terms and approaches could create fears in our fellow citizens."
"Reorientation of our approach to work and hence to vocational training as well, is a demand of our times."
"That is what present-day needs impose."
"Of course, the weight of our responsibility here in the European Parliament and in the European Union as a whole, faced as we are by the nightmare of unemployment, gives no cause for celebration."
"Yet, I would like to stress the fortunate timing of today's debate on the subject, just after the appearance of the British Presidency's programme in which unemployment has been given high and innovative priority, and just a few days, a few weeks after the special conference on employment and in anticipation of the implementation of special action to deal with unemployment and in anticipation, precisely, of the next Summit in Cardiff."
"Here are two fundamental thoughts: I believe that in the effort, which Susan's report mentions analytically, to develop special methods and surveys, we could see, and you too, Madam Commissioner, could look into how to make the best use of Cedefop in Thessaloniki to carry out such surveys."
"And as a last additional thought, I would like to mention that in the Eastern European area and in anticipation of enlargement, both during this transitional phase of intensified pre-accession procedures and in the long term with the future prospect of the new countries, we should already be considering how to extend vocational training to make it accessible to all."
"Mr President, once again I can comment on a report which originates from Sue Waddington."
"I again applaud her precise work and expressly her constructive criticism of the weak spots in the Commission's document."
"The approach, Madam Commissioner, is to be welcomed as an initial attempt to analyze progress in vocational training in the Union and Member States."
"It is understandable that there are shortcomings wherever systems and measures vary too greatly in quality and quantity."
"However, it is not acceptable that there is no clear distinction between business sectors and between target groups - from those actively employed to older people."
"In this connection CEDEFOP and EUROSTAT must be incorporated to a much greater extent."
"The situation of women should be particularly emphasized."
"As a result of their employment often being part-time and seasonal, they are often excluded from learning about new technologies and acquiring new knowledge, although they have just as much intellectual potential as well as a high degree of flexibility."
"In the Commission's report there is no review of the joint programmes, i.e. European Year, LLL lifelong learning , or the ADAPT initiative."
"Various colleagues have already pointed this out."
"The coordination of the training programmes - such as LEONARDO DA VINCI - with the programmes in the structural funds is also still outstanding."
"Further important actors are the social partners."
"They are in agreement about special support for SMEs, in agreement about new training methods and the better mutual recognition of diplomas, but not in agreement about the decision-making levels."
"Right at the top of the agenda must be a framework agreement geared towards the demands of modern work organization."
"At times of crisis further vocational training is judged to be the most dispensable area in the public sector as well, a grave error."
"For how can the shortage of specialist workers in companies otherwise be remedied?"
"Given increasingly shorter product cycles, changes in production and higher market demands, how can employees keep up to be prepared for the 21st century?"
"In the global competitive environment the consistent promotion of the most important resources - human resources - through further training is essential."
"In addition, it is indispensable for intellectual and physical mobility and the personal development of the individual!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, as Mrs Waddington in her excellent report stresses, and as has been often stated here, we need proper information on the feasibility of structural funds and Community programmes for training before we can take decisions on their reorganization and continuation."
"Training, employment and competitiveness are firmly interconnected."
"For that reason Community actions in these areas must be better coordinated."
"The EU must not, however, aim at a united system or programme for further training: on the contrary, I believe that differentials between Member States and the multiplicity of their training solutions is a rich resource that all can draw on."
"In place of a uniform system we must strengthen structures of cooperation."
"In this way we will be able to effectively spread the word on expertise and exchange experiences to learn from one another."
"I would particularly like to emphasize three matters to do with the attainability and quality of further education and training: equality, entrepreneurship and getting prepared for the information society."
"There is greater need for further education and re-training to address the needs of women's equality."
"Naturally the quality of school education plays a key role in the effectiveness of further education and training."
"The skills and will to face the prospect of lifelong training should be the goal of the school curriculum."
"Similarly, school should also prepare women for the multi-faceted nature of women's professions."
"Those who work in or intend to become entrepreneurs in SMEs need special support in the organization of suitable further education and training."
"The right type of training could encourage women to even found their own small businesses and learn production skills."
"Upheaval caused by the new information technology is the main challenge to further training at work."
"Training has to be extremely flexible and diverse, giving consideration to greatly differing needs and individual circumstances."
"Rapid technical development puts adaptability to the test and good-quality further training should, along with providing purely professional skills, strengthen people's ability to take control of change in their lives."
"Training should also include cultural elements, and the ability to improve people's skills of participation and interaction."
"Mr President, I too would like to say that Mrs Waddington's report is very positive, particularly when seen against the outdated figures presented in the Commission's document, and the bureaucratic and both quantitatively and qualitatively inadequate situation of continuing training in the Member States, or at least in Greece."
"Alongside the important vulnerable and particularly sensitive categories, such as women, I want to point to three other important categories, which other speakers too have mentioned."
"First, people approaching the end of their productive years, who become unemployed, have problems with training, but also have a very short time during which to continue their productive life."
"A characteristic example is radiotelegraphists who no longer work on ships.-Secondly, the very young, who come out of university and tertiary education but without training for employment.-And thirdly, immigrants."
"Certain interventions in the area of language, knowledge of the laws and other educational factors would be important in assisting their incorporation into the labour market."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to begin with thanks to Sue Waddington for her report, which as we are already aware has been submitted as a document of very high quality."
"She has very accurately recognized the shortcomings in the Commission's report and I share her criticism of the Commission."
"It is certainly well meant, Madam Commissioner, but in our opinion your concept for the future is too defensive."
"All respect to subsidiarity, but the networking of the economy, the internal market and also the euro make a European strategy necessary."
"This is no contradiction, but a plea for more cooperation."
"The insufficient cooperation of the Member States, which the Commission also ascertained, shows this shortcoming in European thought."
"For some sectors no data were even available, including - conspicuously - data for the training sector."
"The figures on participation in further training measures are also interesting, and the unemployment figures are particularly negative."
"I think, and indeed we all hope, that this will now change as a result of the Amsterdam guidelines."
"For we all know - and I should once again like to specifically point out - that over 50 % of the long-term unemployed in Europe are inadequately or wrongly trained and further trained."
"This demonstrates the special significance of further training in Europe, particularly in connection with the combating of unemployment."
"Formal access to vocational training is certainly guaranteed in all 15 Member States, but the reality - the opportunities for European citizens - varies considerably."
"I refer here quite specifically to the demands of Mrs Waddington in points 10 and 11 of the report."
"The various sectors are also different: for example the building sector, which quite urgently requires a further qualification, because there as well the working materials and the methods are new and they are developing further."
"In the building sector only 15 % are engaged in further training compared to 57 % in the insurance and banking sector."
"There are good approaches and opportunities in many countries, including Germany."
"However, I discovered that all the projects I saw interestingly have a European context."
"They have either been co-financed via Europe through joint initiatives or they are European in-service trainee ships which have been arranged by farsighted teachers."
"The German Federal President Roman Herzog recently gave a remarkable speech, which I do not agree with on every point."
"But in each case I share his criticism of the provinciality of Germany and other Member States."
"We will not achieve competitiveness in Europe by cutting back social rights, but only by promoting lifelong learning."
"Mr President, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur sincerely on the excellent work carried out."
"The subject of education and training is certainly one of the most fascinating and important for the cohesion and advance of any evolved society and, on the eve of the Twenty-first Century, I think we must find a new way of dealing with some of the tensions and contradictions we have before us and which only education and training can help us overcome."
"First of all the relationship between the process of globalization, increasingly extensive and inevitable, and the defence of the values, the roots of each one, the values of the local Community."
"Then there is a need to know how to resolve the conflict between tradition and modernity, because only with a just balance between these two factors is it also possible to govern the more global transformations."
"A third central element is the relationship between the need for competitiveness and the preoccupation with equality and guaranteeing opportunities to all, especially the weakest and the excluded."
"And at least the correct analysis of these three elements can lead to more focussed reflection on the problem of continuous education and training, which must become a central objective of the action of the European Union and the initiative to be adopted at all levels, European and national."
"This concept of lifelong learning may be one of the keys to success in the next century; this has been talked about for a long time, but still too little is done and the Commission's communication, which we are debating today, demonstrates that."
"This concept must be rapidly translated into operational choices, contractual incentives, investments."
"At the Luxembourg Council a precise commitment was made in this direction; we will check in Cardiff whether the Member States will demonstrate consistency."
"I also hope that the Commission will incorporate into its own future work the valuable and important pointers contained in the Waddington report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I highlighted in my address to Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs last July, the Commission is very happy with the particular attention granted by Parliament to this report, which has been discussed within three parliamentary committees, the Committee on Women's Rights, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which has been the lead committee."
"I thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Larive for the Committee on Women's Rights, Mrs GÃ¼nther, for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, and especially, of course, Mrs Waddington for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for the quality of the debate within these committees, as well as the opinion and the draft resolution from Mrs Waddington."
"I can but be satisfied with the support provided by Parliament to the approach taken by the Commission in this first report on the state of affairs in the area of access to continuing training in the Union."
"The Commission shares Parliament's point of view when it notes that regular monitoring in the area of access to continuing training is of great importance in the formulation of the necessary policies and that particular attention should be paid in the future to defining common qualitative and quantitative criteria which will enable results obtained in different countries to be compared."
"Like Parliament, the Commission considers that Eurostat and the CEDEFOP should play a more active role in this follow up."
"From this perspective, the Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 2 and 4 proposed by Mrs Waddington, along with the amendment corresponding to conclusion 2 of the opinion established by the Committee on Women's Rights and the amendment corresponding to conclusion 4 of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media."
"The Commission also considers that it is very important to provide a means of dissemination, at Community level, of good practice in the area of continuing training at all levels, within all industries and fields etcetera, by actively involving the social partners in this step. The Commission therefore accepts Mrs Waddington's Amendment No 6."
"Another point of agreement between the Commission and Parliament concerns the particular role of the social partners in the promotion of access to continuing training."
"They should be able to define, together and at the appropriate level, a certain number of minimal conditions of access, particularly in the light of the Member States' employment guidelines."
"The Commission therefore accepts Mrs Waddington's Amendment No 3."
"Furthermore, the Commission is of the opinion that all future initiatives for the encouragement and monitoring of access to continuing training and the development of new forms of skills acquisition, in particular those associated with modernization of the working environment, must be taken at the level of both Member States and the Union, in close collaboration with social partners."
"These initiatives should be in coordination with the employment guidelines, taking particular account of the conclusions of the extraordinary European Council on Employment, in Luxembourg."
"In this context, I am counting on the British and Austrian Presidencies to widen access to training to an increasing number of our citizens."
"The Commission will watch over the complementarity of these different programmes and Community initiatives in this respect."
"The Commission therefore accepts Amendment Nos 5, 7 and 8 of Mrs Waddington, as well as the oral amendment regarding point D and Amendment No 5."
"The Commission also accepts the amendment from the Committee on Women's Rights, regarding conclusion 1 of its opinion."
"In addition, the Commission will give greater attention to the issue of equal opportunities in the promotion and follow up to access to continuing training."
"It therefore accepts the amendments corresponding to conclusions 8, 10, 11 and 12 of the opinion drawn up by the Committee on Women's Rights."
"Finally, it will take into account, in future initiatives in the area of access to continuing training and skills acquisition throughout working life, the present resolution of Parliament."
"As you know, since the meeting of Heads of State and of Government in Essen in December 1994, Europe has given priority to investment in professional training, which was confirmed in the preamble to the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The rise and development of the competence of the work force is today considered a determining factor in the employability of individuals, as well as in the adaptability and competitiveness of businesses."
"Improvement in access to continuing training and the perspective of training which develops throughout one's working life, enabling continual acquisition of new areas of competence, are at the heart of active employment policies, as the conclusions of the extraordinary Council on Employment on 21st November last and the guidelines for employment policies adopted by the European Council last December showed."
"This direction had already been clearly declared in the national reports of several countries such as Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom."
"The present report, presented today, has three important results."
"Firstly, it shows that the objective of access to continuing training for all workers in the Union remains to be achieved."
"On average, in the Community, only a little more than one worker in four has participated in some form of further education during the year, and less than two out of every three businesses could be considered to be developing a policy regarding ongoing training."
"These figures constitute an encouraging base, but are insufficient in light of the speed of the technological and demographic developments previously highlighted."
"Secondly, Europe must face up to the problem of inequality of access to continuing training."
"Large differences exist, both between categories of businesses and workers."
"Generally speaking, the countries where companies are at the top of the scale also seem to be the most dynamic."
"There is therefore a clear risk of seeing differences forged within the Union."
"Finally, the fact that initiatives in the area are numerous is an encouraging phenomenon, which stems equally from State authorities as from the social partners or businesses."
"This dynamic of initiatives is an interesting and encouraging opportunity to disseminate best practice and to ensure more favourable development as the whole."
"It seems to me important to refer to the follow up the Commission intends to give to the report, in particular the proposal for commencing a process of consultation with the social partners."
"The Commission has noted the new dynamic of Community social dialogue with regard to the agreement reached on part-time contracts with a great deal of interest."
"In addition, if a new phase of social dialogue commences on the theme of information, of worker consultation at national level, it would be possible for training to be fully a part of this, choosing the themes through consultation with the social partners."
"Before any new proposal for follow up to this report I, along with my colleague Padraig Flynn, who is in charge of the issue of social dialogue, wanted to be able to have an in depth discussion with the social partners in the Community on the different paths possible."
"We have also noted that the welcome given to this report by the different Community bodies has been extremely favourable."
"This process of cooperation between the Commission, Member States and the social partners has enabled the establishment of the necessary bases to put in place progressively at Community level a framework enabling each Member State and the social partners to appreciate better the progress achieved, to situate its own actions in relation to others, and to gain inspiration from the experiences of others."
"We therefore have the intention of reconsidering the possibilities for a proposal for a Community instrument which would set up a method of regular monitoring, on the basis of common criteria, established at Community level."
"Thank you, Commissioner Cresson."
"The debate is closed."
"Voting will take place tomorrow at 12: 00."
"Participation in profits (PEPPER II)"
"The next item is Mrs Hermange's report (A4-0292/97), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission report on PEPPER II: promotion of participation by employed persons in profits and enterprise results (including equity participation) in Member States, 1996 (COM(96)0697 - C4-0019/97)."
"Mr President, the report I am today presenting is in line with the Council recommendation of 1992 regarding the promotion of worker participation in company profits, which was a follow up to a Commission report on the situation in 1990."
"In this non-binding instrument, the Council made eight recommendations to Member States for the promotion of participation and asked the Commission to draw up a report over four years on the development of participatory systems in Europe."
"It is this PEPPER II report which constitutes the basis of our reflection today."
"This basis must, however, be improved upon since, if we are delighted at the existence of this report and its contribution to the relaunch of the European debate on financial participation, it has to be noted that it raises, Mr Commissioner, a feeling of frustration insofar as it highlights the weak follow up to the Council's recommendations by the different Member States and proposes no concrete actions for the European Union."
"It is for this reason that our Committee wished to present a certain number of concrete proposals with a view to studying the conditions of implementation and the effects of the PEPPER systems, with the aim of promoting them in Europe."
"The very diverse methods of financial participation vary from profit sharing to share holding, passing through fixed formulae or business plans."
"Furthermore, we all know that legislation varies greatly from country to country."
"Great Britain and France probably have the most advanced legislation in this area, whilst in many countries the issue is left to the discretion of the social partners."
"Financial participation has three associated objectives: to involve workers more fully in the running of the company, to encourage the setting up of collective savings and finally, to develop investment."
"In this way, both employers and workers can be satisfied through a well understood mutual interest. On another level, the State is also satisfied."
"Why are the employers satisfied?"
"Because they often note an improvement in productivity and competitiveness."
"Why the workers?"
"Because they obtain a supplement to their salary, have the chance to build up a progressive capital sum and feel more involved in the success of their company."
"Finally, as far as the State is concerned, it can be observed that participation strengthens the competitiveness of the economy as well as worker satisfaction and could possibly be one of the answers to the problem of modernization of the state pension system in Europe through the financing of complementary pension funds."
"From this point of view at least, the discussion is worth being had."
"Finally, it seems that PEPPER systems may have a positive effect on employment, insofar as worker participation brings about new behaviour and new equilibria within the company."
"This question of employment is at the heart of our concerns these days."
"It is the reason why we are asking the Commission to carry out rapidly a study on the effects of PEPPER systems on employment, production and flexibility of salaries."
"This study should also concentrate part of its analysis on financial participation in SMEs."
"With this in mind, I would like to say to Mr Menrad that I am in complete agreement with the amendment he has introduced, apart from one or two inaccuracies in the French version."
"In my opinion, the question of participation in multinationals must also be subjected to close scrutiny."
"This is the reason why, Mr Commissioner, we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs proposed the creation of a working group made up of representatives from the social partners, Members of the European Parliament and experts from the Commission."
"We would like you to give your opinion on this proposal and, if need be, a timetable along with practical ways in which this working group can be set up."
"Finally, we proposed the establishment of a programme aimed at promoting exchange of information regarding good practice."
"In this respect, a commentary on this programme has been included in the 1998 budget line relating to social dialogue."
"In this spirit, I would like to note that on 7th and 8th May next, a first meeting of worker shareholders will take place in Brussels, which will give rise to the establishment of a European federation of worker shareholders."
"We hope that this programme may be financed within the framework of the promotion of exchange of information."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner! Mrs Hermange has drawn up for the Social Committee an excellent report on the participation in profits and equity of employees and on the Commission's PEPPER Report."
"Many congratulations!"
"In this connection I can submit the response of the Economic Committee for which I have been given three minutes speaking time additionally by my Group of the European People's Party."
"Therefore, at the end I will emphasize those principles of my group which have been incorporated into the response."
"The PEPPER Report contains an overview of the voluntary participation in profits and equity models in the EU and deals with what can be learnt from the collective experiences."
"As we heard, major experiences have been gained above all in Great Britain and France."
"The successes in these Member States with a large number of models are connected in that the idea of statutory framework conditions to promote the financial participation of employees is inspired by many different political powers there."
"Mrs Hermange requests the Commission to reinforce the exchange of information via participation systems amongst the Member States and to start information campaigns in these states, mainly with the social partners."
"The report of the Social Committee adopts the idea of a wages policy which is oriented towards productivity."
"Since the White Paper on Employment it has been recommended time and again by the EU to employers and employees."
"The employees know that in clear text this means restraint in increases in cash wages."
"A franc or a mark can only be spent once, in cash or for investment."
"The report and the response make it clear, however, that it is not enough to fob off employees with a 'thank you' for their understanding."
"They should rather be given interests, on the basis of voluntary models, in profits and investments which would not arise at all without their restraint."
"The PEPPER Report relates rather one-sidedly to employees' corporate equity investments, where they are documented through securities such as shares, employees' shares, stock options, bonds and convertible bonds."
"The Economic Committee rejects investment alternatives if there are no corporate opportunities."
"It also wants to include the promotion of forms of investment in the discussion because they predominantly occur in small and medium-sized companies."
"In Austria and Germany these are undisclosed partnerships."
"This also corresponds to application 4 to amend."
"Application 2 to amend of the Greens Group in the European Parliament seeks to strike from the report the idea of a supplementary retirement pension through property formation and thereby remove it from the debate on capital formation policy."
"Indeed, the PEPPER Report is not a legislative initiative but a stimulus for discussion, and this aspect of capital formation policy should be discussed in any event, especially as it in no way relates to a replacement of statutory social insurance."
"Mr Wolf, I prefer what the speaker for the Greens, Joschka Fischer, recently said at the budget debate in the German Bundestag. 'A broad participation of employees in the capital gains in a company of coowners is the prerequisite for pension security' ."
"The concept of property formation in employees' hands belongs to the most important demands of the Christian-social movement."
"Nell-Breuning, who undertook the essential preparatory work for the social encyclic Quadragesimo anno , once said that partnership and the participation of employees would only take hold as pincers with two jaws."
"One jaw was information and participation."
"Here we commit ourselves to the rights of information and consultation of the European employees' councils."
"In addition, we demand the opportunity to participate in the planned European limited company."
"The other jaw was the participation of employees in productive assets."
"The idea of participation of course not only has Christian-social roots, but amongst other things roots in the Enlightenment as well."
"Francis Bacon, the great English thinker and statesman handed down the maxim: ' Ownership is like dung."
"Today, the demand for a broad spread of productive assets corresponds to this 400-year-old proposition."
"It is not about a backward-looking distribution of ownership."
"The objective is to provide more assistance in the future to those who have been disadvantaged in the past, by adopting supportive solutions."
"Primarily, the social partners are called upon to provide tailored participation models within a national framework."
"The right response of our time is: partnership instead of class conflict."
"With this in mind, I ask you to approve the report by Mrs Hermange, whom on behalf of the Economic Committee I would once again like to cordially congratulate and thank."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to cordially congratulate Mrs Hermange for her excellent report."
"She assimilated the suggestions of the members of the Social Committee into her report, and so the overall report was never contentious."
"My group is therefore against the first three applications to amend which were submitted, and in favour of application No 4 because this is a sensible supplement to the report."
"In June 1992 the Council adopted a recommendation to promote systems relating to the participation of employees in operating profits."
"It resolved - and I am presenting a summarized account of this - to create legal structures for the introduction of such systems of participation, to examine the possibility of whether tax incentives could be introduced, to promote the systems by way of an information campaign and to take into account the findings from other Member States, to ensure that legal and administrative provisions were formulated in such a way that a broad range of systems would be available and would be the subject of consultations between employees and employers, and in particular to take this into account in tariff negotiations."
"After three years all national data were to be made available to the Commission for a new overview."
"These national findings are now presented in the Commission's report and they are, to put it mildly, inadequate."
"Apart from France and Great Britain, practically no Member State has taken any initiatives and there is a complete absence of an international exchange of information."
"Unfortunately, the outcome of this report proves once again that recommendations which have no binding legal force are adopted by the Council only for show."
"After the adoption of resolutions the Members of the Council submit cloudy press releases and leave the recommendations to disappear in the bottom drawers of their desks."
"But we want to see action!"
"The participation of employees in operating profits itself is accompanied by improved productivity."
"It encourages employees to obtain qualifications, at least these are the experiences from France and Great Britain."
"And also, at a time of high unemployment it could, with the introduction of the company participation systems in smaller and medium-sized companies, also ensure better and more secure employment"
"We therefore expect the Council to adhere to its own resolutions of 1992."
"But from the Commission we expect more than merely a report with a description of the facts."
"It should carry out investigations on the effects of the PEPPER systems, set in motion a programme for the exchange of information, set up a working party to promote the introduction of PEPPER systems particularly in international companies and consider a Community initiative on capital formation policy to solve the problem of participation rights for migrant workers as well."
"Model projects should also be developed for the central and eastern European countries."
"However, we expect the social partners to provide information and inform themselves about the PEPPER systems, as well as having regard to these systems when conducting their negotiations."
"Mr President, this is a recommendation from 1992, which according to the Committee and the report has not led to very many national measures."
"Now the Committee is largely behind this report and the proposals for measures we want to introduce, tax relief via the State, grants etc., to increase profit sharing by companies and worker influence."
"That is good, but I think that we should state very clearly that it cannot progress more quickly than the Member States themselves want."
"You cannot dictate from above that this is what people should do and expect that things will necessarily be so."
"I would particularly like to point out some examples which have worked quite well in my country, Sweden."
"We have had cooperatives for a long time, both producer cooperatives, such as in agriculture, and consumer cooperatives which work very well."
"There people go in with one share and have one vote, so it does not work in the same way as the share system, where people go in and buy as many votes they like by buying lots of shares."
"These cooperatives therefore work well."
"Most of them can be developed."
"In addition, there is the possibility of also using economic societies, as they are formally called, i.e. cooperatives, for small companies."
"I think it is important to stress that, and I would like to point out that perhaps people should concentrate more on measures of that kind."
"I personally am also very much convinced that people support companies which are wholly employee owned."
"It provides a totally different way of creating a sense of belonging in a company and a sense that this is something people are doing together."
"That is hardly mentioned in the report."
"However, on the whole the report is positive and we in our group think it is important to strive in this direction."
"We also believe that this can create employment in Europe's Member States in future if it is drawn up in the right way."
"However, it must happen at the speed and in the way which each Member State itself desires."
"On the whole we are also able to support the amendments with some exceptions."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by reminding all of us that the left, both the political and the trades union left, has never in any way been against the people working in companies also having a very, very large influence over the business, both over the corporate environment as a whole and over the use of profits."
"But I think that to begin one-sidedly to emphasize personal shares and personal shareholdings as a driving force for increased productivity in this way is extremely biased and very blinkered."
"What we want instead is a dynamic and creative development with regard to corporate democracy."
"It would have been very good, I think, if both the Commission and the rapporteur had included the need for companies to invest in funds for the future and what we recently talked about, life-long learning, so that there is investment not only in personal ownership, but also in short-term training in order to increase expertise, not just for the individual, not just for the company, but also for society as a whole."
"Mr President, what follows from this?"
"I believe that this must once again be clarified."
"It is not a general question, Mr Menrad, of partnership or class conflict."
"I cannot help commenting here that anyone who cannot engage in conflict will not be taken seriously as a partner either."
"It is a question of how participation systems can be developed beyond the Ford factory, i.e. beyond the large company, with co-management or other means of involving employees arranged by the trade unions."
"We know that the low-denomination share is no answer."
"The shareholder is torn one way and the other between the shareholder value, which calls for sackings, and his interest as an employee, which calls for employment."
"That is the case at Volkswagen, that is the case at Renault and that is always the case wherever low-denomination shares are broadly scattered amongst employees."
"We must urgently examine to what extent we can expand the corporate concept which focuses on the functional context instead of the mere formation of property; modern franchise company chains should be examined in this connection."
"We must also consider the redefinition of the boundaries of corporate and social democratisation."
"In this respect I disagree slightly with the GUE, because local and regional coordination also calls for new forms of incorporation and in that case a reliance on ownership makes complete sense."
"However, in particular this is a matter of genuine participation in profits, not of wages being paid out over an extended period of time, and also of the necessity for providing official cover for the employees' shares."
"We have submitted the appropriate applications."
"We can also support the applications of Mr Menrad, since it seems to us rational to once again support rational privatization with appropriate participation strategies; a specific concentration on small and medium-sized undertakings also seems to us to make sense, provided their particular circumstances are adequately taken into account."
"However, the fundamental issue is to deal with the question which has already been raised in connection with the Meitner plan in Sweden in the full bloom of Fordism: how can a mechanism be effectively installed which cancels out the automatic process whereby the holders of capital accumulate the corporate wealth and the dependent workers can at most reproduce their own working capacity?"
"This is the question we are faced with, and in this respect the PEPPER Report is really only a precursor, as much as Mrs Hermange is to be thanked for drawing something positive from it with the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, recognizing the right of subordinate employees to participate in the profits and success of the company has always been one of the priority objectives of the Italian political right."
"For fifty years we have been maintaining that overcoming the class struggle and eliminating the conflict between capital and labour must essentially come through the participation of employees in the company capital."
"That is why the parliamentary group of the National Alliance is delighted to welcome the reproposing of this subject and congratulates the rapporteur, and we also note the fact that even about six years after the recommendation of the European Council, little or nothing has changed in the various Member States."
"We have the clear sensation that in Europe the issues of occupation and industrial democracy, of a different and qualified role for employees, had become commonplaces, slogans to be used only to display goodwill which then do not find any concrete expression."
"In fact, excluding France and the United Kingdom, where progress has been made in the last five years on the ground of financial participation of employees, in the rest of the European Union a sterile debate continues about understanding whether these new participation systems should be the responsibility of government or the social partners."
"The European Union must demonstrate more courage, more determination in this delicate matter, that is it needs to move from words to deeds, if only through the establishment of a European participation council, with the task of promoting the introduction of participation systems under comparable conditions throughout the Community."
"It is necessary to act so that the social partners include this system in their negotiations and operate so that a regulatory framework is available in the Member States."
"At a time when unemployment remains the most serious economic problem in the European Community at this millennium end, Europe must make every effort to induce the governments of the Member States and set out down a secure road, already successfully tested but so far only used by few."
"Grand intentions are no longer enough!"
"Mr President, I am very pleased about this initiative from the Commission."
"It places emphasis on the advantages there can be in employees sharing in the profits of businesses."
"Profit sharing can make employees more satisfied and motivated, put more in their pay packet and create a better psychological working environment."
"It can make the profits of European businesses grow if productivity increases and it could possibly help improve employment in Europe, which is needed."
"Profit sharing can appear in an infinite number of variations."
"Financial profit sharing, financial democracy or employee shares."
"Favourite children have many names."
"The model which is chosen in the Member States will depend on how the labour market is set up in the country concerned."
"When the Commission's report states that there is no profit sharing in Denmark, that is incorrect, Mr Flynn."
"Employee pension funds own a large share of Danish businesses."
"That means in fact that wage-earners have a large stake in capital in Denmark."
"We should not therefore stick to a rigid picture of what profit sharing means or a narrow European model."
"We should start with the countries' different traditions and learn from each other's good and bad experiences."
"I would therefore support a study into how the various schemes function in the Member States."
"It is also a good idea to set up a working group which should include the social partners."
"This working group could, among other things, examine questions of a transnational character, such as profit sharing in multinational companies."
"In Denmark we do not believe that European legislation is necessary, but we are pleased that in this way we can put the subject on the agenda in the EU."
"This is an area in which we should take the voluntary path."
"It would be wonderful if we could make businesses aware of the advantages of profit sharing through the exchange of experience and studies, but decisions on the introduction of profit sharing should either be left to the individual business or be made the subject of agreement between the social partners."
"Mr President, first of all let me thank Mrs Hermange and the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs on the thorough work that they have done on the PEPPER II report."
"The PEPPER II report gives an overview of the way that the Member States have promoted financial participation of employees in profits and enterprise results since 1992, following the adoption of a Council recommendation on this very issue."
"Since the adoption of the PEPPER report last January financial participation has, amongst many other topics, been discussed in the context of the Green Paper on partnership for a new organization of work."
"The employment guidelines that were adopted in December also invite the social partners to negotiate agreements to modernize the organization of work, with the aim of making undertakings productive and competitive and achieving the required balance between flexibility and security."
"In this context, the participation of employees in profits and enterprise results could assume a greater importance."
"As the PEPPER report shows, profit-sharing is in all cases associated with higher productivity levels, no matter what methods, model specification and data are used."
"Other positive effects of the schemes are on wage flexibility, employment and employee involvement."
"The Commission agrees with Parliament that the impact of financial participation schemes on employment, productivity and wage flexibility should be further studied."
"We agree with Parliament here - measuring the exact impact of such schemes can often be very difficult, particularly given the different fiscal and social security schemes that exist in the Member States."
"The Members will be aware of the great diversity here and it is very hard to get the proper assessment and comparable data analysis in place."
"Furthermore, since it seems that the lack of comparable information may be an obstacle to the promotion of financial participation schemes, the Commission supports the idea of launching incentive measures to promote information exchanges between Member States, provided adequate funding is available."
"I think this is a key request which the rapporteur and Parliament are making today."
"The applicant countries could also be invited to participate in this particular understanding, insofar as exchange of good practice and information is concerned."
"As regards other actions proposed by Parliament, the Commission would prefer to wait until the final results of the consultation launched on the basis of the Green Paper on work organization, plus the issue of setting up a working party, could be considered in the context of the possible follow-up to the Green Paper."
"Thank you Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Kurdish refugees"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation of Kurdish refugees and the position of the European Union."
"Mr President, thank you for your introduction and for the opportunity to address Parliament this afternoon."
"This is my first opportunity and it is one that I relish."
"This is a very important issue which is being debated today and it is a privilege to take part in your debate."
"The presidency shares many of the concerns expressed by the European Parliament."
"The scenes we have all witnessed during the last few weeks of large numbers of distressed and vulnerable people arriving on the shores of Europe are deeply disturbing."
"Some of these people are genuine refugees entitled to the protection of the international community."
"But many are economic migrants in no real danger of persecution in their countries of origin who are merely seeking a better life in the European Union."
"Both categories appear to be being exploited by unscrupulous racketeers who take their money in return for attempting to smuggle them illegally into the European Union."
"As the presidency we are determined to deal with this difficult and complex problem in an effective but humane manner compatible with our international obligations towards genuine refugees."
"This is not just a Schengen problem; it is a common European Union problem."
"It is a problem which challenges our ability to act together both in European Union domestic policy terms and in foreign policy terms."
"The presidency has drawn up proposals to tackle this difficult problem."
"On the domestic front, immigration and asylum policies of the Member States need to be fair and firm."
"External border controls need to be rigorously enforced."
"We are looking within the European Union at what further steps we can take."
"We have suggested that we could be more rigorous in applying sanctions against airlines and other carriers who bring undocumented passengers into the European Union."
"We can ensure that our embassies and consulates, where applications for visas are made by Iraqis, have adequate training."
"We can train airline staff in the detection of false documents."
"But this in itself will not be enough."
"We have to track down and bring to justice the organized criminals who are trafficking in human beings by encouraging people to leave their countries and part with their savings for an illegal passage to Europe, often in appalling conditions."
"The meeting of police chiefs in Rome on 8 January was an important step in this direction."
"Several representatives of those European Union law enforcement agencies most directly affected by the problem were able to pool their knowledge."
"The presidency will seek to build on this."
"We will continue to ensure our law enforcement agencies have the political support they need to be able to work smoothly together to confront this kind of international crime."
"As the presidency we will do what we can to achieve this."
"Since some of the people being smuggled into Europe are genuine refugees fleeing persecution in their own countries, our actions have to be consistent with our international obligations towards such people."
"The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will be kept advised of any measures being planned."
"In turn, the presidency has sought - and we will continue regularly to seek - UNHCR's advice on the humanitarian situation in the regions from which the migrants come."
"But the measures we take domestically will not be able to stem the human tide unless we are effective on the foreign policy front as well."
"We have to look at the root causes of these migratory pressures: the human rights and humanitarian situation in the region and the repressive nature of the Iraqi regime, as well as the fighting in which so many civilians are caught up in Northern Iraq and the south-east of Turkey."
"We have to think hard about what we can do together to solve these problems."
"In particular, we have to support the efforts of mediators in the reconciliation process between the Kurdish parties in Northern Iraq."
"Through humanitarian intervention we need to help create the conditions in Northern Iraq that will remove the incentive for people to leave."
"Turkey has a key role to play in handling this crisis."
"The presidency has discussed the matter with the Turkish Government which is taking the problem seriously and has tightened security measures at ports."
"The presidency has attached the highest priority to work on the action plan on illegal immigration from Iraq commissioned at the Luxembourg European Council."
"This crisis is a real test of the European Union's ability to take rapid and effective action within the framework of both the second and third pillars to deal with a serious problem."
"The presidency intends to do what it can to see that together we pass the test."
"Mr President, the Commission also welcomes the opportunity to discuss this important issue in your Parliament If we want to do justice to those who justly lay claim to protection as refugees on the one hand, but if on the other hand we want to protect our citizens against the problems of illegal immigration, the European Union will increasingly have to strengthen its cooperation and harmonize its asylum, immigration and visa policy, or as the case may be, coordinate more decisively."
"Mr President, the European Union understandably exerts an attraction on many outside the Union who find themselves politically or economically oppressed."
"When the European Union does not offer a common policy in exchange, the pressure of illegal immigration will only increase, resulting in the genuine refugee becoming the victim."
"This is not acceptable."
"We owe a more effective policy to the Member States who are presently carrying the heaviest burden as regards receiving refugees."
"Mr President, when we are talking about the recently observed, increased inflow of Kurdish people, it seems to us that this cannot be primarily attributed to new political or economic causes."
"The Kurdish question is, as we all know, past history, yet unfortunately it should be recognized that a solution cannot be expected in the near future."
"Nonetheless the European Commission is trying for its part, through the MEDA programme amongst other things in the south east of Turkey, but also in northern Iraq through the ECHO humanitarian aid, to improve living conditions there, with the aim of preventing migration as a first option."
"The extra negative dimension we are presently witnessing, and the presidency pointed to this just now, is an increasingly large scale smuggling operation in which criminal organisations earn big money from the misery of thousands who, for whatever reason, wish to live in Western Europe."
"These criminal practices cannot be combated toughly enough."
"We therefore very much welcome the talks between police chiefs which recently took place in Rome."
"Mr President, on issues concerning the third pillar, in which the national authority of Member States dominates, the Commission has taken the necessary initiatives and has submitted proposals, a number of which I would like to mention here."
"The Commission has submitted the proposal for the ODYSSEUS programme, which aims to promote exchange and training of functionaries who work in the field of emigration, external borders and asylum issues."
"This proposal is presently still being discussed in the Council of Ministers."
"We would like to point out the joint action of March last year to recognize temporary protection of asylum seekers, to which your Parliament has given its support."
"The recent events indicate the need for temporary protection, and the Commission hopes that the Council will be able to reach a decision soon."
"Already in 1995 an institutional framework had been adopted for cooperation between Europe and Turkey in the fields of justice and internal affairs, but the mechanisms for implementation have, unfortunately, for well-known political reasons."
"The statement of 16 July last year on the deepening of the relations between the European Union and Turkey contains proposals for further cooperation in the sphere of police and customs; this is backed by financial resources."
"The European Council of Luxembourg considered the consequences of the large tide of migrants, and then, too, the issue of Kurds from Iraq was discussed, and, as you know, the Council is preparing an action plan in which third and second pillar aspects are gathered."
"In this context the Commission wishes to point to the complementary nature of the Union initiatives on the one hand, and action as part of the Schengen agreement on the other."
"This is important because the Schengen agreement was incorporated into the Treaty of Amsterdam, and because current developments might endanger the implementation of one of the objectives of the Treaty, namely the abolition of border controls."
"Yesterday a task force met to discuss a whole range of practical measures to control external borders on the basis of a list drawn up on 15 December."
"Mr President, in conclusion the Commission would like to express its appreciation of Italy's efforts to respond adequately to the pressure of hundreds of new immigrants, and to do so in compliance with the obligations of international conventions, such as offering humanitarian aid and the opportunity to submit an application for asylum, whilst at the same time meeting its obligations to protect the external borders as effectively as possible."
"Mr President, the joint action plan which is being prepared by the Council, will try to gather together all policy areas."
"The Commission on its part will vigorously support the presidency's efforts for far-reaching agreements between the Member States."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe the two statements have shown that there are very many points of agreement between the institutions of the European Union."
"Firstly, it is important that the right of asylum is fully safeguarded in this Europe."
"Secondly, however, it is important that we put an end to criminal organizations, which cannot be tolerated or sympathized with because they commit the ultimate sin of exploiting human misery out a lust for profit."
"Thirdly, I should like to fully support what the President-in-Office of the Council also mentioned: it is a question of combating the causes of migration, as you also stated, Mr Commissioner."
"I believe we must all endeavour to solve the problem of the Kurds - the economic, social, political and cultural problem of the Kurds, not only in Turkey but especially in Turkey."
"However, I would like to take this opportunity to state quite clearly that to many people it appears to be no coincidence that this immigration occurred a few weeks after the Luxembourg summit - this reaction appears to be no coincidence."
"It may indeed have happened with the knowledge of the Turkish authorities."
"We must follow up several reactions closely."
"We must be patient."
"We must continue the dialogue with Turkey despite all the problems this involves, because a problem such as that of the Kurds can ultimately only be resolved jointly, with mutual support and assistance."
"We must also convince Turkey that it is not only an internal problem, not only a problem to be resolved politically or even militarily, but a socio-economic and cultural problem which is to be resolved; and that Europe wants to help, not oppose Turkey, and would like to point Turkey in the direction of assistance."
"Fourthly: the burdens."
"The Commissioner also addressed this matter and others have addressed it - if we want to combat the xenophobia, which there most unfortunately is, and in some cases also the hysteria which accompanied it, we must consider how the burdens and the responsibility incidental to the refugee question can be better apportioned."
"We also addressed you on the matter, Mr Commissioner in the Committee for Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"I believe that more must be done to make it clear that in the event that some countries - Italy has on many occasions acted in an impeccable manner in this connection - becoming directly affected by floods of refugees, other countries in Europe cannot say that this does not concern us, that is their problem, or perhaps react in an even more negative manner."
"In Europe we must assume responsibility for this jointly, and jointly create a rational asylum policy in this Europe."
"This has not yet happened, and there will be other colleagues addressing the subject."
"The common foreign policy must ensure that the right of asylum is safeguarded in this Europe, that no fortress of Europe comes into being, but that a rationally controlled immigration policy ensures that xenophobia is eliminated and that we are an hospitable Europe, but for those who really need our help and support."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I think Commissioner van den Broek was right to recognize that the problem of the Kurds cannot be regarded just as an operation of police containment or security to be progressed with exclusively containment operations, given that it is a matter of an eminently political question which goes precisely to the root of things."
"Twenty million people, divided between five states, a people without a land, an ancient cultural identity torn apart, people without citizenship, subjected to harsh repression and authoritarian regimes."
"All this cannot be removed from the European conscience."
"I believe the problem must be approached with due caution but also putting the issues back into proportion."
"Only 2 646 Kurds have disembarked on the Italian coast, 1 500 Turkish and 1 384 Iraqi."
"Italy has operated, and I want to give credit to Commissioner van den Broek for having recognized it, according to the international agreements and respecting the Schengen Treaty, strengthening the controls, expelling the clandestine immigrants - 54 000 and 38 000 in 1997 - sticking to all the obligations which are necessary but also adopting the measures which must be taken to be able to respect the right of asylum, without unloading its own responsibilities onto other countries."
"But the question must be dealt with in a unitary and political way, also seeking to develop a different kind of policy towards Turkey which remains, precisely, a central country in decisions in respect of the Middle East."
"I would like to say here that Europe is not only the Europe viewed horizontally, as Mr Cook viewed it this morning, framing it from Edinburgh to Vienna, but it also goes from Edinburgh to Barcelona, to Naples, to Athens."
"Only by looking at Europe in comprehensive terms can these problems be dealt with, applying that due wisdom and also that due humanity which is imposed from the start to these problems."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when in days gone by Kurdish refugees disembarked in Italy and to the appeal for solidarity launched from my country for a common European action came the response that the problem was entirely Italian, our European citizens had the proof, once again, that they belonged to an acephalous Union, a Union which imposes rules on everything that can be regulated in everyday life, but which then goes into hiding when world-scale events become urgent for our continent."
"The disembarkation of the Kurds in Calabria and Puglia is just the latest chronologically and the Union will increasingly be considered a priority destination by refugees."
"There are two points I consider fundamental, the first political, the second legal and institutional in nature. We who have contributed to the dissolution of the eastern regime, we who have started action to strengthen the weak democracies of those countries, we who have opened up the Union to enlargement to the other countries operating, in fact, a choice which also opens up new fractures, we cannot ourselves turn away before such emergencies."
"So a coherent and tangible policy is needed, also to promote economic development of the regions of Asia Minor, the Mediterranean and its peoples."
"As regards the legal and institutional aspect, I would mention that Title IV or the new treaty confers on the Council the task of defining, within five years, common rules for crossing external frontiers, visas, asylum and immigration."
"Given that the southern coasts of the Union are no longer national boundaries but frontiers of the Union, we ask that common and lasting solutions be urgently found."
"Mr President, I think the Council Presidency and Commissioner van den Broek are very clear that it is absurd to think that they can stem the Kurdish migratory flood without a radical change in the situation in the places where they live today."
"I am thinking primarily of Turkey and Iraq."
"The causes of the migratory flood must be understood, it has been said. The causes are simple: war is being waged against the Kurds in Iraq, and the Turkish army has carried out massacres against villages inhabited by Kurds."
"Those are the causes of this flight: political causes, primarily political, which make the Kurdish question a political question."
"I believe that all this makes it urgent and necessary to hold an international conference on the Kurdish question."
"That is a very pressing necessity and the European Union can and must take this problem on board."
"A commitment from the Commissioner on this issue would be important."
"I only want to add that I too consider important the recognition shown for the positive role played by the government of my country."
"It has not been a pretty sight to see other governments say that the problem of migration was just an Italian problem;"
"I think it is now time to pose the question of a common political asylum policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate concerns political responsibility."
"It is a question of dealing responsibly with the subject of 'flight' and a coherent European response to the question of helping refugees who are seeking protection."
"This debate is about refugees and helping refugees, not about preventing refugees from taking flight in the first place."
"We are experiencing precisely the opposite."
"Refugees are being criminalized indiscriminately and the medium of Eurodac, Mr Wiebenga, is a means of criminalizing refugees indiscriminately."
"They are per definitionem being turned into illegal immigrants, and now an entirely new concept is being introduced into the debate: that of the illegal exit."
"I am familiar with this concept from the linguistic usage in the GDR, and Mr Swoboda uses this concept when he demands that Turkey as it were prevent refugees being able to escape from Turkey in the first place."
"With the calls for Schengen to be repealed, which is only possible if there is an actual threat to public order and internal security, 2, 000 people in flight are declared to be a threat for 370 million EU citizens."
"This is demagogic and represents an exploitation of the misery of people in flight for party political purposes, for election purposes and for purposes quite different from ensuring that the right of asylum is upheld here."
"When now above all the Federal German Minister of the Interior, who over the last few days has posed as the taskmaster of Europe, criticises Italy this is an open call to violate prevailing asylum law."
"He also calls for the Geneva Refugees Convention to be violated!"
"He calls for the European Convention on Human rights to be violated!"
"Indeed, where have we arrived at here if European responsibility now only means undermining the law of asylum as far as possible."
"The Kurdish problem is not a police problem"
"Please allow me to say one more thing: four weeks ago Mr Juncker said here in this room that he would not sit at a table with torturers, and he was referring to the Turkish Government."
"Four weeks later these very people are being cooperated with, the Turkish police are being cooperated with and there are discussions with the Turkish police as to how the culprits can combat the victims"
"(Applause) This is deceitful and cynical and makes it clear how seriously human rights policy is conducted!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, many colleagues have highlighted the cacophony Europe and some Member States have demonstrated faced with the issue of the flood of Kurdish refugees into Italy."
"I associate myself with those criticisms, I say that the Italian authorities have acted properly and have shown, from this point of view, a great sense of responsibility, but at the same time I answer the fact - if I may - that, if we had thought in time that these frontiers and these asylum measures for refugees are measures to be taken henceforward at the European level, it cannot but be recognized that neither in the Treaty of Amsterdam, nor in the action of the Council, which has blocked a draft convention on external borders since 1991, are there encouraging signs."
"Europe is there, but when it is needed it is missing and missing too often!"
"It is a task which the British Presidency will surely have to deal with to bring order to a situation which can no longer be left to the national governments."
"Having said that, may I say, Mr President, on the text that we will be voting on, that we are preparing to vote unilaterally, without dwelling for a moment on the Turkish question which was left in suspense in Luxembourg, and voting on a text of this kind risks being another slap in the fact to that willingness to re-open the dialogue on the participation of Turkey in the European Conference which we are all looking forward to and on which we are working, but which, unfortunately, has had no reply from Parliament."
"Mr President-in-Office, I would first of all like to wish the British Presidency the best of luck."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the influx of hundreds of Kurdish refugees into Europe gives us the opportunity to question ourselves on the functioning of the police cooperation foreseen in the Schengen agreements and in the section concerning the total abolition of border controls on movements of people."
"The assessment is clear."
"This arrangement is inappropriate."
"Italy joined the Schengen group on 26th October last, and yet nearly 10, 000 illegal immigrants pass through southern Italy every month in order to gain entry into the rest of Europe, benefiting from the internal borders which are easily crossed."
"Austria, who joined Schengen on 1st December 1997, has just invoked the safeguard clause in order to increase controls at the Italian border."
"France, which already uses this clause on its northern borders, has considerably strengthened controls along its borders with Italy, without even attempting to invoke the legal cover of the safeguard clause."
"In any case, we have to recognize that the whole world is making a fool of the Schengen agreements."
"As an MEP of a border region, I know that border controls in no way constitute a hindrance to freedom of circulation, just as showing our parliamentary or civil servants' identity cards is not a hindrance to our entering these Parliament buildings."
"As an MEP of a border region, I know the political and socio-economic damage caused by unfettered emigration."
"Each country must remain free to decide who lives within its borders, to protect and respect those it accepts and to refuse this right to those who do not respect its laws."
"It is precisely within this context that the Treaty of Amsterdam anticipates, within a five year period after its enforcement, the abolition of all controls on movement of people, including those from third countries, at the internal borders of the Union."
"And they want France to amend its constitution to this end?"
"I simply hope that the French, and in particular those from Alsace, will be able to give their opinion on the subject and reject the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Mr President, once again I am wondering what Europe wants and what role Europe is playing in the face of the daily events of extra-European immigrations of entire peoples."
"On the one hand it welcomes the new arrivals and encourages this mass transfer, and on the other it tramples indecently on the rights of the peoples of the Member States: Padania is an example of that."
"Turkey and Iraq share the territory of Kurdistan, while Italy and the Member States share the Kurdish people robbed of their homeland."
"I wonder if the Union did not have the political strength to react or did not want to react against the Turkish government, which speaks of democracy and in reality bombs and kills Kurds and in its own country obliges citizens to write their religion on their identity cards."
"What Europe do we want to build if we fail once again to demonstrate the capacity or the will to combat effectively the criminality which organizes mass exoduses speculating on the lives of desperate people?"
"Of course the criminal organizations know how inefficient Europe, this Union is, better than the Union knows the criminal organizations."
"In this way, dear Europe, we will again show our incapacity or, worse, our true objective: doing exactly the opposite of what we say."
"Mr President, I think I too must highlight this fact that has shaken all of us: the Europe we have discovered on the occasion of the arrival of the Kurdish refugees in Italy has been the Europe of exposed nerves and ugly conscience."
"Exposed nerves because slightly more than two thousand refugees were enough for someone to call for the immediate annulment of a pact, an agreement, a treaty which has cost so many years of work and which built the possibility of free movement."
"Moreover, ugly conscience because it is that same Europe, those same forces, which did not want to reach the only possible conclusion which the citizens ask us for and which is a common policy on immigration and asylum; now, not in five years time."
"Fortunately facing this Europe there is another: a Europe which we have seen, with a delegation from the Party of European Socialists led by my colleague, Mr Schultz, to Puglia and Calabria; the Europe, that population, those administrators, those governmental organizations, the Catholic church, in the first row, clamouring for common policies on immigration and asylum, calls for Schengen to be experienced for what it is, as a solidarity pact and not as an opportunity to unload the barrel on the other, above all on those mother nature has blessed with a beautiful sea: the sea, not the small internal borders of a state like Luxembourg."
"And still they ask us, they have asked us, starting with the Archbishop of Lecce, whom we met, to formulate a policy on the right of asylum."
"We are no longer in the presence of emigration, we are in presence of migrations which will increasingly tend to resemble what is happening in other parts of the world."
"We also ask for something else, they ask for it, but we also ask for it: a fight against crime."
"You know that at present, for example in Puglia, other arrivals are expected in the coming months, but not in the great ships immortalized in Amelio's film; high speed rubber dinghies are expected at night, which will land a few people at a time."
"To control 120 kilometres of European coastline, is perhaps the case of contributing to the operation of our government in southern Albania to stop the criminals organizing this exodus."
"We have talked with Kurdish, Tamil, Singhalese refugees: US$ 4, 000 each to get to Hamburg and Amsterdam."
"We explained to them that, correctly, the Italian government, for humanitarian reasons and also for practical reasons, had decided to apply the right of asylum."
"I say practical reasons, because with the old law, even facing things that we did not want - expulsions - the way would have been open to reach the north."
"From this angle - if you will permit - those who abused our government were twice mistaken, but above all made a grave error: that of demonstrating that this Europe of exposed nerves, of ugly conscience is alive in their person and in their behaviour."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we Europeans will, it is to be feared, more frequently have the opportunity to talk about refugees escaping to Europe."
"Therefore, it must firstly be emphasized that what is happening in Italy at the moment does not represent an Italian problem, nor a German problem, nor even a German-Italian problem, but that the movement of Kurdish refugees is centred in Turkey."
"Therefore, the first demand to be made to the Turkish Government is that the conflict with the Kurds be settled peacefully and by constitutional means and on the other hand that it be ensured that criminal organizations which also make capital out of human misery and use Turkey as an escape route be rigorously prosecuted."
"That is the first demand."
"Secondly, it has been said that the Schengen Agreement must be repealed."
"Now, ladies and gentlemen, we must refrain from demanding the repeal of European provisions whenever there are difficulties."
"Schengen contains all the possibilities of dealing with such situations."
"This is precisely why we concluded the Agreement!"
"I accept that the Italian Government is playing its part in fulfilling these obligations and it must be acknowledged that it is more difficult in Italy than in other countries."
"We must also develop an awareness ourselves that with the protection of the external borders, increasingly fewer decisions will be taken on illegal immigration."
"Because - in an age of mobility - we neither can nor want to turn Europe into a fortress, decisions on illegal immigration must be taken in the individual countries."
"We must decide whether refugees can stay in our country or not, and such decisions must be made quickly and constitutionally."
"If we come to the conclusion that they cannot stay, they simply have to be returned to their own countries."
"This also relates to the regulation of immigration, not only the protection of external borders which is being discussed at the moment."
"A final point: everything we are now witnessing in connection with the situation in Italy cries out for a European ruling."
"We cannot pretend that such problems can only always be solved by the countries which are currently affected."
"This requires joint European efforts such as they are laid down in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"They should therefore be implemented quickly, not only when the five-year term has ended; we should make a start immediately."
"This is what the case of Italy, the case of the Kurdish refugees, warns us about."
"Mr President, it is very sad that the fate of the Kurds started to preoccupy the European Union more intensely mainly only after a small part of the problem began being exported to the West."
"If we had not confined ourselves to pious words when the bombing of whole villages and the annihilation of a nation began at the Iraq-Turkey frontier and on Iraqi soil, Europe would perhaps not now be facing another flood of immigrants from the East."
"The suspicions that Ankara itself may be involved in the recent waves of illegal immigration to the West in retaliation for the well-known Luxembourg decision do very little to change the general picture."
"The Kurds are still being annihilated in their own homeland, which is divided between four countries."
"And as has already been said, we are speaking of 20 million people."
"Before the West of Europe began to worry about recent events, for years Greece had already been troubled by the latter-day slave traders who transport the illegal immigrants."
"But at first, nobody cared."
"At the beginning of the century Europe had and missed the opportunity to solve the Kurdish problem once and for all."
"Now, of course, things have changed."
"Yet, there are always ways and means for peaceful intervention, both to stop the genocide and to stem the flow of illegal immigrants."
"The issue is not just a matter for Schengen."
"Beyond Schengen, Europe has a very profound humanitarian and cultural tradition, this is a major political and humanitarian issue, and we cannot ignore the humanitarian dimension."
"Mr President, I see positive developments in Europe's policy towards the Kurdish problem, which because of this dramatic, biblical exodus, has been elevated to the status of a major issue, an issue which goes beyond the problems of immigration and asylum and takes on the character of a policy of ethnic cleansing."
"Mr President, since I am about to ask the President-in-Office a question, I would like him to follow what I am saying."
"Of course, I do not know whether he speaks Greek."
"I would like the President-in-Office of the Council to follow my speech."
"I do not know if you can speak Greek and understand my Greek."
"You can understand my Greek?"
"OK."
"To continue, then."
"There is the aspect of ethnic cleansing, reducing the Kurdish population and, as we did with the Moslems from former Yugoslavia, whom we took in but at the same time strove to intervene and made proposals for a solution to the Yugoslavian problems, so too we ought to make proposals for a solution to the Kurdish problem."
"There are, however, no such proposals."
"For the first time we are debating whether we can see through to the roots."
"And my question to Mr Henderson - to which I would like an answer - is whether the General Affairs Council of 26 and 27 January will go to the roots of the problem and whether the proposal made by the Italian Government for an international conference on the Kurdish problem is to be discussed."
"I await Mr Henderson's answer."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, we Italians are very expert, historically, in the fact of migratory flows."
"In fact, for centuries the people of central and northern Europe have crossed the Alps to find in Italy such a happy place they even make it their empire."
"I add, also at the historical level, that the present Turkish tragedy is a consequence of the hypocrisy and egoism of many so-called civilized and advanced countries, which have contributed to - and have often connived in - the fact that this people is still denied one country, safe and peaceful."
"I agree with those who have already maintained that the problem of the Kurds is not an exclusively Italian problem, even if we are experts in emigration and occupation, but it is a problem which is above all and uniquely European, if for no other reason than that the many arms manufacturers selling arms to those countries so that they can peacefully slaughter each other are European."
"So the problem is European from that viewpoint as well."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was not satisfied either by the explanation of the President-in-Office of the Council or your explanation, Mr van den Broek."
"We are talking about the fate of people who are forced to escape because they are threatened life and limb, because their property is threatened, because they are driven out of their native country, because members of their family have been killed and because their basic living standards have been destroyed."
"Although what the President-in-Office of the Council tells us, and what you tell us, is right, cannot be denied and holds true in all respects, it is not enough."
"We cannot respond to these phenomena merely with a technocratic reaction."
"You made it precisely clear what the spirit at the Commission and in the Council of Ministers is when you said 'We must protect people from persecution, but we must also protect the citizens of the European Union from floods of refugees' ."
"No!"
"We do not have to!"
"The citizens of the European Union are not currently threatened by any flood of refugees."
"This involves 800 people whom I myself was able to visit in camps and of whom the overwhelming majority come from the Iraqi part of Kurdistan."
"Who are the 50 % currently in the camps in southern Italy escaping from then?"
"They are escaping from Saddam Hussein for example, and not only from Turkey but from the Turks as well."
"But when Saddam Hussein occupies Kuwait and when this man produces weapons which are internationally outlawed and forbidden, an international alliance comes together to overpower him, which is right."
"We talk about the victims of this man here as if we had to ward them off."
"This spirit is dangerous, it poisons the atmosphere in the European Union and with this kind of policy and this kind of discussion we help such powers to have the upper hand in the European Union, who want what Mr Nassauer does not want."
"We do not want a fortress Europe, that we agree about, but we are not the majority."
"There is a whole group of people in this Parliament as well who do not think like you, Mr Nassauer, and do not think like I do, who want a fortress Europe and who construe this kind of debate which we are conducting as a justification and legitimation of what they think is right."
"Therefore I hold a different opinion."
"We ought not to confine ourselves to saying that we need harmonized law in the European Union, we also need something else."
"Do you know what?"
"A ban on weapon exports in such areas, for example."
"And we need an international outlawing of countries which pursue their policies in contempt of international law, as Turkey does in northern Iraq, and countries which unscrupulously repress minorities and deny them cultural and ethnic self-determination, because these are the real causes of their having to escape."
"Please also allow us to discuss these substantively political reactions here as well, in addition to the mechanical reactions."
"Mr President, I thought it was a bit pessimistic of Mr Schulz to say that we do not have a majority."
"I think we almost unanimously agree, as we do also, to a large extent, with what the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner said."
"I have to say that I was very taken with the fact that they both place the problem in a wider context, and do not give in to the tendency to panic reaction to an incident and shoot, but instead to look at the problems which take place in the second and third pillar, which are really the cause of what is happening."
"The strange thing is that, with reference to the enlargement of the Union, the European Parliament stressed only recently that we are a league of constitutional states and democracies, and that only Member States which meet these conditions can join; that the emphasis on the constitutional state is immediately and forcefully proved as being right by the arrival of boats with hundreds of refugees from Turkey and Iraq, countries where there is no constitutional state and democracy for these people."
"It has already been said that there may have been a kind of revenge action as a result of the rejection of Turkey's desire for membership of the European Union."
"It might be a good thing if the President-in-Office of the Council was to refute this, because it would be a strange situation if this country was to try and join the European Union using this kind of blackmail."
"But the story is going around, and I think it might be worth refuting."
"Secondly, I would like emphasize the fact that there are of course also problems in the sphere of foreign policy."
"My colleague Nassauer has explained the Schengen issue excellently."
"Our foreign policy is I think often caused by massive migrations, massive refugee movements."
"With Bosnia it was in a direct sense."
"Now it may be in a roundabout sense because we do not have a preventative foreign policy."
"The same may happen in the future as far as Algeria is concerned."
"I think we have to make efforts to create a truly common foreign policy towards these countries."
"Only too often the Member States not are always on the same wavelength with regard to problem areas."
"I find this a grave danger, which will materialize in large numbers of refugees presenting themselves at our borders, amongst them people who can genuinely be described as refugees who rightly carry the name refugee, because that is far from always the case at present, of course."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions , proposed pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"And so I give the floor to Mr Henderson who has also been given permission to say a few words about the situation in Algeria."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to make some remarks in response to the debate."
"There has been some heat in the debate and I have enjoyed listening to the various views expressed by different Members."
"Within the furnace of that heat, I think there has been a lot of common ground on which we can all build with a view to the future."
"It has been recognized that there is a need for urgent action at European Union level."
"This is not a problem that affects only one part of the Union; it affects potentially the whole of the Union."
"It is also welcome that there is an understanding that there needs to be cooperation among the Member States."
"We all face this problem and maximum solidarity would obviously be helpful."
"It has also been heartening that there has been a complete condemnation of the cynical trade in the human misery which has been perpetrated by those criminals who run the gangs and try to take money from innocent victims by telling them of a future that they might have in the European Union which is not possible."
"It has also been important that it has been recognized in the debate that action is also to be taken in the countries where people are fleeing from."
"Can I apologise to Mr Alavanos for not listening to the whole of his contribution."
"In the old style of the House of Commons in Britain I was trying to do two things at once, being briefed on the next matter while the current one was still under discussion."
"But I can say to him that the presidency will report the debate to the General Affairs Council on 26 January."
"I do not exclude anything from the discussion."
"I have not heard of great support for the proposed conference as being the centrepiece of tackling the problems that we face but we will look on 26 January at ways in which these matters can be addressed."
"Mr Oostlander mentioned the question of Algeria and potentially of course there could be a similar problem emanating from the troubles and the difficulties there."
"I have been asked to comment on reports that the Algerian authorities have rejected the proposed troika visit."
"The presidency this afternoon is seeking clarification from the Algerians of their response."
"We are surprised at the report since the Algerians had previously indicated to us that they would accept a troika visit."
"We are in urgent contact with our European Union partners and will continue urgent efforts to find ways to end, or to try contribute to ending, those appalling atrocities."
"We will also take forward a close dialogue with the Algerians authorities in the coming hours and days."
"Thank you, Mr Henderson."
"A brief comment from Mrs Aelvoet."
"Mr President, I would just like to make the point to the presidency that it is surely not unjust of the Algerian authorities to respond to the fact that the troika which was sent comprised diplomats and not ministers, when it concerns such a delicate and politically sensitive matter."
"That is the issue, and that is what they responded to."
"Thank you."
"Does the President-in-Office of the Council wish to respond to that remark?"
"We will consider different ways of dealing with this difficulty."
"We exclude nothing."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is questions to the Council (B4-0001/98)."
"Question No 1 by Freddy Blak (H-0940/97)"
"Subject: Belarus"
"The dictatorial regime in Belarus headed by President Lukashenko is responsible for ongoing and systematic abuse of human rights."
"The opposition is being brutally annihilated."
"The leader of the Belarus Human Rights League, Yevgeny Novikov, recently went underground after being subjected to severe harassment without the Belarus police intervening."
"His office has been seized and taken over by a state organization and his colleagues have been beaten up."
"Is the Council aware of Yevgeny Novikov's fate?"
"Is the Council prepared to intervene and investigate developments in this case?"
"Finally, how will the abuse of human rights in Belarus affect the country's relations with the EU?"
"The Council is aware of the events surrounding the occupation of the office of the Belarus League for Human Rights in Minsk."
"It is still not clear who was responsible for the occupation."
"Mr Novikov was abroad during the seizure of his offices."
"He subsequently returned to Minsk and had meetings with the British ambassador in November and December 1997."
"Although he had been questioned by the authorities, Mr Novikov had not been arrested."
"The Belarussian authorities have now issued a ruling that Mr Novikov's premises should be returned to him and a notice to quit has been served on those currently occupying the office."
"The Council sees no need at present to intervene with the Belarussian authorities on behalf of Mr Novikov."
"The Council reminds the honourable Member that the Union wishes to see Belarus join the community of democratic nations and that the Union is ready to support the process of democratization in Belarus."
"Nevertheless, during 1997, the Council noted with concern that Belarus had not made any substantial progress in this direction and it became evident that numerous violations of human rights and basic freedoms, notably concerning the freedom of the media, had been committed by the Belarussian authorities."
"The General Affairs Council conclusions of 24 February, statement of 29 April and conclusions of 15 September reflected these concerns."
"The Council, in cooperation with the OSCE and the Council of Europe has reacted to these events with speed and determination and will continue its efforts to urge the Belarussian authorities to respect human rights and democratic principles."
"It is extremely happy news which has come from the Council."
"The pressure which Parliament, among others, has been involved in putting on Belarus has thus helped Mr Novikov to perhaps get his rights and also his office back."
"But the President-in-Office also mentioned the harassment of journalists, and I would like to ask whether he knows how many legal actions there are against journalists, because freedom of expression is being grossly suppressed in Belarus."
"It is generally recognized that journalists have been restricted in Belarus in reporting on events in that country."
"There are specific instances which I have been made aware of. I cannot, at this moment, give particular details, but I would be happy to write to the honourable Member at a later stage and give him the information that I have in my possession back in my office."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to make the following enquiry: this is indeed only an individual case which is described here."
"There are certainly considerably more cases."
"There are organisations whose activity is obstructed or which are simply excluded from Belarus, be it the IRI from the United States of America or also the Pan-Europa-Union from Europe, which have been unable to pursue their activities there."
"However, we all know to what extent Russia is itself involved in Belarus and what opportunity it has to influence Belarus."
"Do you not think it is time that we, who are pumping so much money into Russia from the European Union, should gradually start knocking at Russia's door and tell them that as they have such an influence in Belarus, they should use their influence there so that these questions of human rights can somehow be tackled in order that we can also somehow exert our influence there"
"Mr President, I think that the questioner is right in saying that the situation is very complicated and it might be possible for the Russians to have some influence."
"In the past the Russians have been able to exercise some influence on events in Belarus."
"As I understand it at the moment, there is not a clear understanding between the Russians and the Belarussians."
"A lot of the talks that they have had have not been fruitful."
"This is something that we would want to raise with the Russians in the Cooperation Council and I would be interested to see what their response is."
"I hope that they can help."
"I do not have huge optimism in the very short term but perhaps in the medium term the situation will be better."
"Actually, my question concerns precisely the same thing."
"The fact is that last spring a union was created between Belarus and Russia."
"Belarus is strategically important for Russia as a borderland to the West and as a symbol that although the Soviet Union may have been split apart, in some respects has also been geographically restored."
"I am of course very keen for the Council and its members to use all conceivable opportunities in their contacts with President Yeltsin and other members of the Russian Duma and government in order thereby to be able to influence Belarus so that the country takes in at least some of our criticism of the undemocratic system which prevails there."
"What initiatives is the Council prepared to take in this direction?"
"Mr President, I am grateful for your help but probably not as grateful as the interpreters are."
"I would like to say to the honourable Member that I think she has, in essence, raised a very similar point to the previous questioner."
"I understand that there is sometimes a feeling that the Russians can always have their own way in places like Belarus."
"At some time in the past that may have been true."
"In the period after 1989 Russia was probably still able to have a considerable impact there."
"Most recently this has not been the case but I did give an assurance to your colleague that I would raise that point at the future cooperation meeting with the Russians and I hope that they will be able to exercise some influence on the situation."
"Question No 2 by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo (H-0941/97)"
"Subject: Exclusion of unemployed Spaniards from the benefits of the new employment policies"
"Will Mr Aznar's solitary self-exclusion, at the 20-21 November 1997 Luxembourg European Council, from the main agreements designed to combat and prevent youth and long term unemployment not be detrimental to the unemployed themselves, who will not as a result be able to take advantage of the employment and training opportunities which will be available?"
"How many unemployed people in Spain will be excluded from the measures adopted?"
"Should a suitable timetable for the implementation of the agreements not be drawn up which would enable the unemployed in Spain to benefit from the measures agreed?"
"How will it be possible to ensure that they are not disadvantaged by Mr Aznar's negative decision?"
"At the extraordinary meeting of the European Council on employment held in Luxembourg on 20 and 21 November 1997, the Member States agreed unanimously on a new coordinated approach to tackling the Community-wide problem of unemployment, whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity and accepting that different nations' situations will result in differing emphasis."
"The measures agreed in Luxembourg, which were formally adopted by the Social Affairs Council on 15 December 1997, will be applied to all Member States across the European Union."
"Member States will develop policies to ensure that every unemployed young person is eventually offered a new start in the form of a job, training, retraining practice or other employability measure before reaching six months of unemployment, and that all adults without work are offered a fresh start before they reach 12 months of unemployment."
"The European Council agreed that these objectives should be implemented within a period not greater than five years."
"It is true that this implementation period may be extended in Member States with particularly high unemployment, but the Luxembourg conclusions will eventually be applied in full across the whole of the European Union."
"Thus, the honourable Member should recognize that no exclusion of any kind arises from the Luxembourg conclusions."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is a known fact that the self-exclusion of Spain, as decided by Mr Aznar, will result in unfair treatment for unemployed people in Spain."
"In view of that, and since the European Council is not a Community institution, I would ask whether the Council of Ministers will be supporting Mr Aznar's mistake, or whether, conversely, they will recommend that it is put right."
"It is not true that the measures will be applied to everybody in the same way."
"Being British, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you understand our well-founded fears better than anybody else, since the model Mr Aznar is following in this area is precisely the same as Mrs Thatcher's model, and as such, it means that the benefits of the new employment policies are being denied to the country most in need of them."
"I think there is a bit of a misunderstanding."
"Although Mr Aznar expressed some concerns about some of the directions of the discussion in the Luxembourg Council, the agreement reached exempts no Member State."
"However, the Council recognized that, in particular circumstances, there may be a need for a longer timescale for implementation of some proposals."
"At this stage there has been no exemption and, therefore, Spain and Spanish regions like Andalucia where there is high unemployment, will be expected to deal with the decision in Luxembourg in the same way as others throughout the European Union."
"I see Mrs Izquierdo Rojo is asking permission to speak."
"Unfortunately, the Rules of Procedure do not allow me to let her do so."
"Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar has the floor."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo's question - and the way it was put - can only be seen as an attempt, here in the European Parliament, at the irrational, demagogical opposition which her party practises in Spain."
"It also shows that she has not taken the trouble to read the conclusions of the extraordinary meeting of the European Council on employment."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, has any country excluded itself from presenting a national employment action plan at the forthcoming European Council in Cardiff, or announced an exclusion clause with respect to the Council directives?"
"Mr President, please give me some support. I am being interrupted."
"Mrs Izquierdo, I would ask you please to remain silent."
"You have had your minute, and have spoken."
"I now have to ask you to respect the right of other Members of this House to speak, as is customary, and as you normally do."
"I find any other behaviour surprising because your manners in this Parliament are normally very good."
"Mr President, I also remember that Felipe GonzÃ¡lez' socialist government (which bequeathed 3 million unemployed to the Aznar Government) refused in 1996 to present the multi-annual employment plan decided on at the Essen Summit. That was recorded in this Parliament's proceedings."
"Mr Aznar's Government, in contrast, is at this very moment holding discussions with the trades unions on the action plan to be presented at the European Council in Cardiff."
"Thank you, Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar."
"Mr Henderson, you can see we have lively debates here, just like in the House of Commons."
"Mr President, I was about to say to you that I thought I was back in the House of Commons in London."
"I can only say to Spanish Members that it is quite clear that there are no exemptions from the decision made in Luxembourg."
"It has been recognized that there may be a need for extended timescales in some instances, as yet undefined, but that the principles of the conclusions at Luxembourg must apply across the European Union."
"Every partner within the European Union is expected by the British Presidency to come forward with action plans, which will allow a discussion of those plans in the organs of both Parliament and the Council before the Cardiff Summit, hopefully so that there is an opportunity for the different partners to learn from some of the suggestions of some of the other partners and also from the reflecting comments of both Parliament, which are very much valued, and, indeed, of the committees of the Council itself."
"Question No 3 by Birgitta Ahlqvist (H-0944/97)"
"Subject: Freedom of movement between Sweden and Finland"
"Freedom of movement is a fundamental principle within the European Union. It was established in both the Preamble and Article 3 (c) of the Treaty of Rome and has been confirmed on many occasions since."
"However, despite its acceptance of the Community patrimony, the Finnish government now intends to charge Peter Enbuske, a Swedish citizen, customs duties and VAT on his vehicle, on the grounds that his frequent visits to Finland (where his fiancÃ©e is resident) make him a Finnish resident with an imported vehicle."
"The rule referred to is paragraph 1.2 of the information leaflet on the temporary use of vehicles in Finland, which states that a citizen is deemed to be resident in the place where he or she spends 185 days per year."
"Peter Enbuske is domiciled in Sweden, holds a Swedish passport and pays all his taxes in Sweden, which makes the Finnish government's action a flagrant violation of the right to freedom of movement."
"What measures does the Council plan to take to resolve this situation and prevent its recurrence?"
"The issue raised by the honourable Member is undoubtedly of considerable importance, not only to the individual named in her question but also in so far as it is likely to have a direct impact on other citizens of the Union in a similar position."
"However, what is at issue here - and the honourable Member has hinted as much in her question - is whether a particular Member State is correctly applying the relevant provisions of Community law."
"I would point out that this is not a matter for the Council but rather for the Commission."
"According to Article 155, first indent of the EC Treaty: ' The Commission shall ensure that the provisions of this Treaty and the measures taken by the institutions pursuant thereto are applied.'"
"Article 177 of the Treaty is also available to individual persons as a remedy, for example by raising a question in proceedings before a national court, which may then be referred to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling on the correct interpretation of relevant provisions of Community law."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers for his reply."
"This is not just a matter for Sweden and Finland alone, but just as the President-in-Office says, it is a violation of the EU's principle of free movement."
"As I understand, the European Court of Justice has previously underlined this in a similar case between Denmark and Germany, the so-called Ryborg case."
"I am also glad to hear that there are ways to proceed, i.e. that the Commission or the individual can take this to court."
"I would like to ask a closing question: What are you, Mr President-in-Office, going to say to these EU citizens?"
"I should like to say to Mrs Ahlqvist that I cannot give an opinion on the individual case raised by the honourable Member but I should like to point out the ruling, which she has referred to, already made by the Court of Justice in a 1991 case: ' The mere fact that a national of a Member State B who has moved to a Member State A where he has found employment and accommodation has after a certain date and for over a year spent almost every night and a weekend with a woman friend in Member State B, whilst retaining his employment and his accommodation in Member State A, is not sufficient to justify the conclusion that he has moved his normal residence to Member State B' ."
"I would like to thank the Council for the answer I have received."
"I also understand that it is the task of the Commission to ensure that these rules are followed."
"At the same time it is a very serious problem."
"There are now a lot of examples of almost 'persecution' of Swedish citizens."
"There is a couple who have a summer cottage in Finland and have had their car confiscated by Finnish customs because they travelled to their summer cottage too often."
"The fact is that it is the Council which once adopted the directive which is the basis for the action of Finnish customs."
"The Council must be able to have an idea as to what extent this was the intention of the directive, i.e. that you could prevent boyfriends from meeting their girlfriends and old couples from visiting their summer cottages in this way."
"I wonder whether you think that is the spirit of the directive which the Council adopted?"
"I have to return to the gist of my original reply, which is that this not really a matter for the Council to remedy."
"There are avenues open to those who wish to challenge this situation if they believe that Community law is being infringed."
"If there is some doubt as to the intention of Community law, it might be wise to raise this with the Commission."
"It would be inappropriate for me to make specific comment on that."
"This is not going to be an international match, but a combined attempt to work towards the same objective as friends from across the water."
"I would like to report that I have personally submitted a complaint to the Commission regarding Finnish car taxation."
"The question which I would like to ask the Council of Ministers is whether it would not lay the foundations if the Council of Ministers and the Member States could agree on common guidelines, firstly with regard to car taxation, and secondly with regard to what is a person's domicile according to tax legislation, which is something which has often been raised in Parliament's Committee on Petitions."
"This should also be harmonized since we have seen many cases where people are 'persecuted' in precisely the way in which Mrs Ahlqvist and Mr SjÃ¶stedt have described."
"Is the Council of Ministers prepared to take legislative action?"
"I would say to Mrs Thors that free movement is not affected by the levels of taxation on vehicles."
"The setting of the levels of taxation does not fall within the Community's powers."
"Therefore, I can only repeat that if the current situation is thought to be outside Community law, it is up to those concerned to challenge that in the appropriate avenues."
"It is up to those who believe that the current position should be upheld to make their views known and make the necessary representations, which might be opposed to those made by others."
"It would then be up to the courts to decide."
"Question No 4 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis (H-0948/97)"
"Subject: Political representation of Greece in the Committee of the Regions"
"Article 198a of the Treaty on European Union is concerned with the establishment of a ""Committee of the Regions' consisting of representatives of local and regional bodies."
"Members are appointed by the Council acting unanimously on proposals from the respective Member States."
"The Greek Government has proposed to the Council six local government and six regional government representatives for the new four year term."
"The members of the Committee of the Regions have formed political groups as in the European Parliament."
"However, of the twelve members representing Greece, the Greek Government has proposed ten members from its own ranks and to the left of the wider political spectrum and only two (a mayor and a prefect) from the official opposition party which (according to the most recent parliamentary elections) represent 38 % of the Greek people."
"No other Member State has acted in this way and the adoption of such arbitrary and self-serving partisan tactics at European level, merely serves to undermine the fundamental principles governing the political representation of our country within the Committee of the Regions."
"What steps will the Council take before 22 January 1998 to prevent the distortion of the political representation of Greece in this European body consisting of local and regional government representatives?"
"The members of the Committee of the Regions are appointed by the Council acting unanimously."
"Nominations for the next four-year term of membership will be considered by the Council in the near future."
"Nominations for membership are a matter for individual Member States."
"The only Treaty criterion which nominees must meet is that they must be representatives of regional and local bodies."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I know what the Treaty provides and I mentioned it in my question, namely that there are no specific criteria."
"However, the European Union is supposedly structured on the basis of the principles of democracy and representation."
"It should also not escape our attention that the Committee of the Regions is organized in political groups, as we the European Parliament are too."
"So what is happening in the specific instance?"
"Greece has twelve delegates."
"The government itself, the socialist government, appointed Greece's delegates four years ago on the basis of the same results of the local elections, in accordance with which our party, the official opposition, had four delegates."
"Now, in the new delegation, the socialist party with 41 % has seven delegates and we have only two."
"You can see that this is clearly unfair."
"I know your position is a delicate one, but I would like to hope that there will be some intervention, even behind the scenes, to correct the matter."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to ask the President-in-Office: does he not think that a precedent is created by this decision so that everyone can do what they like?"
"And could he tell us where else he may be aware that anything similar has happened, anything like what I have reported."
"Mr Hatzidakis, I really have to refer to my original reply to the question."
"As you yourself have affirmed in the wording of the question, in Article 198a of the Treaty - the establishment of the Committee of the Regions composed of representatives of regional and local communities - membership of regional and local bodies is the only criterion which the Treaty on European Union established for the appointment of members to the Committee on the Regions."
"The Council has no locus to question the political affiliation of nominees."
"I do not consider that any precedent is being set and as for other examples, I do not have the knowledge of who has been appointed in the past."
"I would think that the questioner would have as much access to that as I would."
"If he wishes a reply to that he can, no doubt, raise that at a later date when I have had notice of the question."
"Mr President, I listened to the answer given by the President-in-Office."
"I am not one to encourage interference in my country's internal affairs, especially by English representatives, because we have bitter and painful experience of their interference."
"The problem, however, is a different one."
"The European Union wants this body to be representative."
"That is why it says the delegates must be elected."
"So what is happening among those elected? Are some considered 'dirty' and are not, therefore, put forward by the government, while others are 'clean', in other words party members, and those are the ones put forward?"
"In that case representativeness goes out of the window for this Community body and you have an obligation to do something about it, since you act over the most trivial matters and prosecute small producers for fraud."
"Here we have a political fraud of the first order, and you must intervene."
"Mr President, I really have nothing further to add to my previous two replies which I hope make the position clear."
"The responsibility is that nominees be from regional and local bodies and it is not our responsibility to assess political affiliations."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I understand and sympathize with your dilemma in this debate."
"Somewhere, Mr Henderson, you said at another stage of today's debate that you felt as if you were in the Parliament of the Communities."
"I too could say something similar, in other words it is as if I were in the Greek Parliament."
"I believe this is an issue which, if it is as important as Mr Hatzidakis thinks, should have been debated there."
"Besides, it is a somewhat strange view that the municipal, local and regional authorities are classified into political and party factions."
"I believe that representation at local authority level is different."
"At any rate, Mr Henderson, perhaps you can find some way to look into similar questions in the future, when as you said, you become more experienced in these matters."
"In any case, I do not think there is a problem about this, as Mr Hatzidakis has tried to represent here, which he ought not to have done."
"It is often said that it is unwise to become involved in family arguments but it is sometimes quite amusing to watch from the outside."
"I can see that in some of the questions local political differences creep into the debate."
"I really cannot add to what I have already said in relation to the original question."
"Not so much a point of order, Mr President. I wondered if the President-in-Office would comment on the fact that this is a problem not just in Greece but in a number of Member States and whether he will commit his own government to review the political balance of the UK representation on the Committee of the Regions?"
"Question No 5 by Gary Titley (H-0950/97)"
"Subject: Expiry of the SFOR mandate and the peace process in Bosnia"
"How does the Council envisage the development of the peace process in Bosnia in view of the expiry of SFOR's mandate in June 1998?"
"The peace process has made good progress since Dayton was signed two years ago."
"In particular many of the military provisions of Dayton have been carried out."
"The focus for the coming year will increasingly be on civilian implementation but it is clear that this will continue to require maintenance of a secure and stable environment."
"The Peace Implementation Council, in which the European Union and Member States actively participate, considered at the Bonn Conference on 9/10 December a continuing military presence indispensable for this task and welcomed NATO's plans to consider options for a multinational follow-on force to SFOR beyond June 1998."
"The European Union has made clear its support for the High Representative in implementing the conclusions of the Bonn Peace Implementation Council."
"I wish to begin by extending a warm welcome to Mr Henderson as the acting President-in-Office to the delights of European Parliament Question Time."
"I should like to ask him three quick questions."
"Firstly, is there any indication yet as to whether the Americans will retain forces in Bosnia and, if so, will they actually be in Bosnia or over the horizon in Hungary?"
"Secondly, is it not the time for European rhetoric on a European defence identity to have some actuality and for us to start to take more responsibility ourselves for the Bosnian peace process in the long term?"
"Thirdly, does he accept that unless we can get the civilian aspects of Dayton up and running, we will end up with another Cyprus where we have a permanent military presence in a divided country?"
"I warmly thank the honourable Member for his kind remarks and for his question."
"I have to tell him that no decision has yet been reached by the American Government though the matter is under consideration."
"Representations have been made by a number of Member States on this question and there will be meetings in Washington between the presidency and the United States Government later this week."
"I am sure this will be one of the items which will be given consideration."
"I would agree that it is important that more responsibility is taken and this is something which the presidency would hope to develop over the coming six months as an important priority in foreign policy."
"As to the long term, the honourable Member is absolutely right that it is very important that, in colloquial terms, we 'keep a grip' of the situation in political, diplomatic and military terms."
"It is vitally important that we continue to make progress, albeit sometimes slow progress, so that an end is in sight for those who are involved in the situation on the ground, in particular the civilian population, and that they continue to give support to the peace process."
"Hopefully, that will produce results if not in the short term, then in the medium term, and not deteriorate into one of these international situations which goes on for many years, rather than being resolved, and where it is very difficult to see progress."
"Mr President, it goes without saying that the duration of the SFOR Mandate is also closely linked with internal developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"I would like to make two points in this respect."
"First the question of returning those who have been expelled."
"There are problems everywhere, in all three subdivisions, but most of all in the Republic of Srpska, where there has until now not been any actual return and I would like to ask whether it would not at least be possible to reach a binding agreement with Mrs Plavsic, that opportunities are at last created in the Banja Luka area for the return of expelled persons."
"The bishop of Banja Luka was here in Strasbourg a few weeks ago and expressed exactly this demand to us."
"The second point refers to the question of war criminals, in particular Mr Karadzic, but also other."
"Here too, advances must be made for until these two points are resolved, it will not be possible to terminate the SFOR Mandate either."
"The questioner raises the very important point that a key element in the Dayton process is that there should be returns of refugees."
"Any influence the presidency can exert will be directed at trying to encourage those involved to follow that route."
"Following on from Mr Titley's question to the President-in-Office, I welcome Mr Henderson's confirmation that the issue of US involvement in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be on the agenda of the EU-US ministerial meeting in Washington."
"There is another issue that I want to raise."
"Will the President-in-Office also indicate the priority he attaches to improving the delivery of EU aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina?"
"I thank the honourable Member for his question."
"I should just like to make it clear that the matter I referred to was not a formal agenda item in the presidency visit."
"It is, however, something which has been dealt with on a number of occasions by a number of the Member States and is constantly under review."
"The question of aid is an important issue."
"Again, I hope I can reassure the honourable Member that we will be doing what we can during the presidency to try to help release the aid which is potentially there for those involved."
"It is a matter of getting clarification as quickly as possible from those on the ground of what would happen to that aid - that it was going to be used for the purposes for which it was intended and that there were structures in place which would make sure that would be the case."
"Hopefully those reassurances can be given at an early stage and can be confirmed."
"Then, I would hope, it would be possible to make the aid donation at an early stage."
"Question No 6 by Bernd Posselt (H-0951/97)"
"Subject: Human Rights in Cuba"
"In the light of its critical opinion of December 1997, how does the Council judge the political and in particular the human rights situation in Cuba, including the question of freedom of conscience and religion?"
"In this connection, where does it stand on the possibility of Cuba's joining the LomÃ© Convention?"
"At the second evaluation of its common position on Cuba in December 1997, the Council concluded that no substantive change in the political and economic situation in Cuba had occurred in the six months since the last evaluation."
"The Council reiterated that the objective of the European Union towards Cuba remains the encouragement of a process of peaceful transition towards democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, sustainable economic recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people."
"Freedom of conscience and religion are not expressly guaranteed to citizens under the Cuban constitution and, therefore, their application by the Cuban authorities is a question of practice on a case-by-case basis."
"Cuba has not applied for membership of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group."
"The Council has not discussed the possibility of Cuba acceding to the LomÃ© Convention."
"Membership of the ACP is primarily a matter for the ACP themselves."
"However, it is clear that, if Cuba were to be considered for membership, it would have to abide by well-established provisions of the LomÃ© Convention which include respect for human rights and the rule of law and democracy."
"Mr President, many thanks for your very precise information."
"I would just like to address two supplementary aspects."
"We had elections last Sunday in Cuba in which 601 out of 601 parliamentary candidates were elected and I wanted to ask the Council where the development towards democracy is to be found!"
"The second question that I want to ask is this: Next week, I believe, the Pope will be in Cuba and we learn that the international press is to be denied access to Cuba, in other words that the major newspapers will not receive accreditation in Cuba for this event, and I wanted to draw this to the Council's attention."
"I believe that honourable Members of Parliament can make judgements that they think are appropriate on Cuba, in the same way as I can, as an individual."
"As President-in-Office, I do not see that I have access to any special information that would allow me to make a different assessment."
"One thing that is worth mentioning is that in any definition of democracy, clearly elections play a very important part."
"They are an important condition of a democracy, but they are not a sufficient condition."
"There are other conditions that have to be met in a democracy: press freedom, human rights and other issues."
"I was not aware of the particular circumstances that have been drawn to my attention in relation to press coverage of the proposed visit."
"I can only say that I will examine what happens in reality as distinct from what is now being suggested might happen, and reflect on such reports as I receive on that matter."
"Those reflections will assist the presidency in drawing conclusions on the current situation in Cuba and on how we should respond to the various events there."
"I too would also like to welcome the new President-in-Office and ask if he does not agree with me that the trade boycott of Cuba by the United States actually strengthened the links between Cuba and the former USSR?"
"By forcing economic dependency on that country it was actually counterproductive in terms of democracy."
"There are countries benefiting from trading arrangements from the LomÃ© convention with governments which are actually quite a long way from the kind of parliamentary democracy that we understand in Europe."
"Nevertheless, they are given trade preferences."
"Surely Cuba is more likely to move towards a more democratic form of government through strengthened trade links with democratic countries and being readmitted to the mainstream rather than being regarded as a pariah state?"
"Can I thank the honourable Member for the supplementary question."
"It is true, of course, that there was an American boycott and Members will draw their own conclusions as to the effect of that over a long period."
"I think that it is worthwhile drawing attention to the fact that the European Union never endorsed such a boycott, preferring discussion and persuasion as a means of trying to seek change within Europe."
"Indeed I know that there were many visits to Cuba from the nations who make up the European Union to take part in discussions and to try to persuade the Cuban government to take a different view on a number of matters both political and economic."
"Can I thank Mr Morris for allowing me this minute."
"I wonder if the President-in-Office would agree with me that the human rights of Cuban children were affected by the very same economic embargo which Mrs Hardstaff referred to?"
"Children have been denied food and medicine because of the United States embargo."
"Would you not agree that a major contribution to raising the living standards of the Cuban people would be the immediate lifting of the American embargo?"
"It is against all international treaties, all international laws and indeed has been condemned, as has the Helms-Burton Act, by the European Union."
"For Mr Posselt's information he will read all about the Pope's visit to Cuba in the Morning Star."
"I understand the plight of poor people in Cuba - particularly children who might be suffering in the current situation - and, clearly, there is evidence of that."
"The responsibility for that has to lie primarily with the Cuban Government."
"That is not to deny that there are other influences but the responsibility for a situation internally is something which must be accepted by the government."
"As I said in my answer to Mrs Hardstaff, I believe that the boycott was not the right way forward, that it is better to persuade, and that if the Cuban Government was more receptive to some of the persuasion, then it may be that it would benefit from greater trade links, perhaps from further help, and that in itself could be a major contributory factor in helping the poorest people in that country, particularly the children."
"Question No 7 by Glenys Kinnock (H-0953/97)"
"Subject: South Africa-EU trade negotiations"
"Would the President-in-Office confirm that the conclusion of the EU trade negotiations with South Africa is a priority for the UK Presidency?"
"Does he anticipate that the difficulties related to agricultural products, wines and spirits and fisheries can be overcome?"
"The presidency would like to express its satisfaction with the breakthrough in the negotiations with South Africa that took place late in 1997, when South Africa presented its detailed trade offer to the European Union."
"The Community is now preparing an equally detailed trade offer to present to South Africa as soon as possible."
"The President-in-Office can confirm that the conclusion of the trade negotiations with South Africa is a priority for the UK Presidency."
"The presidency is aware of the sensitivity that some Member States attach to certain products."
"These sensitivities and the interests of the Community in other areas will, of course, have to be taken into consideration when negotiating with South Africa."
"The presidency will watch for a satisfactory outcome to all these issues."
"Again, welcome to the British Labour President-in-Office."
"I should like to follow up on what you said about the contentious products included in these negotiations and ask whether the presidency would consider separate protocols for these products in order to ensure some progress in the negotiations, particularly in relation to wines and spirits and, of course, the prospect of a fisheries agreement?"
"Might it not be wise at this stage, anticipating the successful outcome as you do of the negotiations, to issue an immediate invitation to President Nelson Mandela to come to the Cardiff Summit to put his personal signature on the agreements which we hope will be reached and, of course, to give him his very first opportunity to come and sample the delights that Wales, in particular, has to offer?"
"I thank the honourable Member for her kind remarks and for her question. I, too, believe it is very important that progress is made in trying to reach an agreement with South Africa during the British Presidency, and it is one of our top priorities in that area of involvement."
"I wish to say that I do not exclude any way of dealing with the various issues before us in those talks."
"I do not exclude the possibility of separate protocols but, clearly, it is something which the Commission would have to give consideration to, and we await with great anticipation Commission proposals, which will then be subject to discussion in the Council. I hope I can reassure her that we want to make progress as quickly as possible."
"In relation to the honourable Member's remarks on the Cardiff Summit in Wales, it would be a nice idea if President Mandela were able to come."
"There are five months between now and then and I hope that an answer to that question may be given more authoritatively in due course."
"I welcome the President-in-Office's cautiously optimistic response there."
"However, I have to say that in this House we have heard endless goodwill towards South Africa since the end of apartheid but there has been relatively little action, particularly on the trade and cooperation talks."
"Time, in a sense, is running out because after the British Presidency other events - renegotiation of LomÃ©, enlargement and so on - will very quickly crowd in on the agenda."
"So, if we are to get a settlement, it is absolutely crucial that we get one during the British Presidency."
"The problem up to now has been in the Council, not with the Commission and certainly not with Parliament, and if the South African Government comes back to the Council and wants to renegotiate a mandate, the British Presidency will have to give this an extremely high priority indeed if it is going to bring the more reluctant Member States into line."
"So I hope that there is awareness that there might be a renegotiated mandate and that the British Presidency will give this top priority if need be."
"Thank you for the supplementary question."
"I think it focuses on a very important point."
"There is a window of opportunity over the next five months to try to conclude an agreement."
"After that period there will be many other matters which will be appearing on our agendas."
"I myself have been reassured by the statements of negotiators on both sides who have said that an agreement can be reached by mid-1998."
"That gives me cause for optimism and I can assure you that we will use all our endeavours during our presidency to bring the Union along with us in trying to seek an agreement at an early stage, so that everyone can benefit from it, particularly those who are in most need of the benefit in the poorer sections of the Community and South Africa."
"I welcome the President-in-Office."
"For the South African trade agreement this is obviously good news, but I have two possible problems to raise about one of the difficult or contentious subjects to which both he and Mrs Kinnock refer."
"Firstly, South African fishing."
"I have met the ambassador and the ministers of fisheries from South Africa on a number of occasions and I hope I can be assured that the Commission will not press the South Africans to open their waters to European Union fleets before they want to or before they decide to."
"I hope that this will be respected."
"Fishing is a terribly difficult subject."
"Secondly, there is the problem of South Africa in the region."
"It is clearly the dominant, political and economic force in southern Africa and I am concerned about the effect of an agreement - I hope that this is borne in mind - on surrounding states, in particular Namibia and its fishing industry."
"I would like to say that I understand the point that was made but, first of all, there is a distinction between a policy for South Africa and a policy for southern Africa; that is one aspect in relation to the matters he raises."
"I hope Mr Crampton will understand that in a negotiation it is best not to exclude items at the earlier stages of that negotiation."
"That is not to say that some of the points which he made will not be consistent with the final agreement."
"But I think it would be wrong of me to try to pre-empt what the negotiators might agree, and that must cover all of the issues."
"As I said in my reply to Mrs Kinnock and the original question, I would not exclude separate protocols on certain aspects of trade."
"That is something which the negotiators will have to take on board when they address the issue."
"Question No 8 by Nikolaos Papakyriazis (H-0954/97)"
"Subject: Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament - incarceration of Leyla Zana in Turkey"
"On Wednesday 17 December, the European Parliament will award the 1997 Sakharov Prize to the Algerian journalist Salima Ghezali in recognition of her endeavours in the field of human rights and for the achievement of a peaceful solution to the Algerian crisis."
"In 1995 the Sakharov Prize was awarded to Leyla Zana, a Kurdish Member of the Turkish Parliament, in recognition of her unyielding struggle, for which she was relentlessly persecuted and incarcerated by the Turkish Government."
"Today, two years later, Leyla Zana is still incarcerated in Turkey, despite being internationally acclaimed as a women symbolizing the peaceful struggle for survival of a people which continues to suffer persecution and violent repression in Turkey."
"Now that Turkey is endeavouring to move closer to the European Union and relations between the two are under discussion, Leyla Zana has become an even more meaningful and poignant symbol."
"Respect for human rights, international law and democracy is, after all, one of the fundamental requirements and basic conditions of the European Union."
"What measures will the European Council take to ensure that the Turkish Government meets its fundamental obligations and to secure the immediate release of Leyla Zana, Member of Parliament?"
"The European Council meeting in Luxembourg on 12 and 13 December 1997 underlined the need for the Turkish Government to meet its fundamental obligations in the field of human rights and democracy."
"It recalled, in line with the Council position expressed at the Association Council with Turkey on 29 April 1997, that strengthening Turkey's links with the European Union also depended on that country's pursuit of political reforms, including the alignment of human rights standards and practices with those in the European Union as well as respect for and protection of minorities."
"The Council regrets the position of the Turkish Government concerning the case of Mrs Leyla Zana and can assure you that the situation of human rights and democracy, including the rights of members of the Kurdish population in Turkey, will continue to figure prominently on its agenda."
"Those issues are ever present in our dealings with Turkish authorities."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I take this opportunity to congratulate the British Labour Government, through you, on its assumption of the presidency and on its presentation today, by Mr Cook a few hours ago, of the British Presidency's programme, a creative, dynamic and very ambitious one."
"Thank you very much for your answer."
"I think it is very satisfactory and complete, to the extent that it deals with general principles."
"However, my question specifically concerned the release of Leyla Zana, our parliamentary colleague whom we here in the European Parliament honoured with a major prize, the Sakharov Prize, for her fight on behalf of democracy."
"Mr President-in-Office, I know that just 14 days after the beginning of your term in office you cannot have a 'personal' position and view about the matter."
"However, I asked the question about the need for Leyla Zana's immediate release in the hope that today, or at some foreseeable time, I will get a specific answer from the presidency."
"I thank Mr Papakyriazis for his kind remarks on my answer."
"I really have very little further to add, except to say that the presidency will pursue the course with vigour that I outlined in my original reply."
"Whilst thanking the President-in-Office for his reply, which is a very good one, will he bear in mind the fact that when we were considering in this House the Customs Union with Turkey, it was conveyed to many of us that, if that were approved, then Leyla Zana and other prisoners would automatically, in due course, be released."
"This just has not happened."
"At this stage there is not only Leyla Zana, important as she is, but there are many other Kurdish prisoners who are in a like condition."
"Will the President-in-Office make it quite clear to the Turkish authorities that, until some movement takes place on this and other issues, it will be quite impossible for us to achieve any real improvement in the relationship between Turkey and the European Union, which all of us would like to see greatly improved?"
"I hope I can convey to the honourable Member a reassurance that the question of human rights is a very important part of our presidential foreign policy."
"There are situations that have been discussed in the past, where commitments have been given."
"We will continue to pursue with vigour the course that I identified in my answer to the original question."
"I, like he and others, hope that we will manage to be successful."
"An improvement in human rights in Turkey is a very important part of the continuing dialogue with the Turkish Government and the Turkish people."
"Thank you for the answers we have so far received regarding this question."
"I believe the UK Presidency should be able to do great things during these six months."
"This includes the question of human rights and imprisoned Kurds, including Mrs Leyla Zana."
"However, I thought the introductory address by the Council's Foreign Minister this morning said very little about Turkey."
"But it said a lot about Cyprus."
"I have a supplementary question which it may not be possible to answer directly, which I understand."
"Would you as the representative of the EU for six months be able to propose that a delegation from, for example, the EU, the OSCE or the UN be sent to Turkey to find out what is happening there and to create good relations with the country?"
"That is a straight question to which I would very much like to have an answer."
"As I have said to other honourable Members, this is an important priority of the presidency."
"It is linked to a number of other important foreign policy matters which will be under discussion during our presidency."
"It is a priority of our presidency to try to make progress."
"I have no illusions about the difficulties involved in some of these issues, but I hope I can reassure the honourable Member by saying that we have a determination to try to make progress."
"I have personally been very closely involved in that;"
"I have been to Turkey fairly recently;"
"I keep a close eye on what is happening and what the situation is; and I have made, in a British capacity, many representations to the Turkish Government about changes that I and others would want to see taking place."
"I would hope to continue during the presidency to make similar representations to the Turkish Government in the hope that they would recognize that there needs to be change and that, as change takes place, benefits will accrue not only to those who suffer because of a lack of human rights - and who, in some cases, are incarcerated - but also potentially to Turkey and the Turkish people in building better, stronger and more effective links with the European Union."
"Question No 9 by Jonas SjÃ¶stedt (H-0955/97)"
"Subject: Eurodac Convention"
"The Council is to decide on the details of the EU's common system for checking the finger prints of asylum-seekers, Eurodac."
"How will registered asylum-seekers be able to correct erroneous information about themselves in the system?"
"Will the current data in the register be deleted automatically once an asylum-seeker has been granted a residence permit in a Member State?"
"Does the Member States' obligation to report information to the register imply in the last resort that finger prints should be taken by force?"
"Regarding the draft Eurodac Convention, I would first of all like to emphasize that the Council submitted this text for the opinion of the European Parliament on 6 October 1997."
"The discussions of the Council are currently under way and it is difficult at the present time to predict what direction they will take."
"It is even more difficult to say when they may reach completion."
"However, at this stage, two things are certain."
"Firstly, any taking of fingerprints can only be done in full and complete compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"Secondly, the Council awaits with interest the European Parliament's opinion on this draft Convention which was forwarded to it a little over two months ago."
"In fact, the Council has not yet reached agreement on the whole of the text in question and intends to continue its discussions in the light of the European Parliament's opinion."
"I would like to thank the Council of Minister's for its reply."
"I understand that it is not possible to give all the answers today."
"However, I think it is important to debate this now because it will be too late to debate it when the decision has been taken."
"The draft resolution which existed for the Council of Ministers' meeting in December included a British and German reservation with regard to the possibility of removing personal information on refugees who have been granted residence permits."
"I regard this as of central importance so that people who are quite legally resident in a country are not registered."
"I wonder whether you reached any conclusion on this point at the Council of Ministers' meeting in December."
"The other thing I would like to take up is the experience from the Schengen Agreement which has a similar structure to the Eurodac system."
"There you can see that refugees' rights are looked after very badly. They are not informed when they seek asylum and they have great difficulty in practice in appealing against decisions."
"How are we going to avoid the same lack of legal rights occurring in Eurodac as now exist in the Schengen Information System?"
"In addition I would like to express my opinion that I think it is unreasonable to base this on systematically taking the fingerprints of everyone, even children of the age of 14, and that as a last resort force may even be used to do so."
"These are not criminals, but refugees, i.e. people who are seeking protection."
"I have to refer you back to my original answer."
"At the Council in December, agreement was reached to freeze the text of a number of articles."
"Agreement has yet to be reached on the rest."
"So I can say that these matters are essentially under review."
"I can give you a firm commitment that the Council very much upholds the rights of refugees."
"That has been made clear on many occasions."
"I hope I made that clear in my own contribution earlier today in relation to the debate on the Kurdish issue."
"While on the one hand the Union, together with the Member States, has to take measures to protect boundaries to make sure that there is a regulation of migration, it is equally important for the Union to uphold the principles which are incorporated into the Convention on Refugees and for the Member States also to uphold those principles."
"I hope that will ensure that when someone comes to any state within the European Union and says that he is likely to suffer persecution and has a strong case for political asylum, that case is given every possibility of being heard and, where the case is established, political asylum is granted."
"Where refugees feel the case has not been given proper consideration there should be measures in all the Member States which the refugee or his or her representative can take to try to reassert the rights of genuine refugees."
"That is the case in all our Member States' law but that is not to say that on every occasion everything is done in a proper fashion."
"There are sometimes slip-ups."
"Where slip-ups do arise, I hope it is possible for genuine refugees to seek redress."
"I can assure you that the presidency will do everything it can to contribute to upholding those important principles."
"I add my welcome to the British Presidency and say how nice it is to have a British Labour Minister answering questions, something I have been waiting for patiently - or impatiently - for fourteen years."
"The issue of the Eurodac Convention highlights the way in which legitimate concerns and national security can sometimes conflict with human rights and civil liberties."
"Parliament will be debating a report on the Eurodac Convention tomorrow and voting on it later."
"I would like to refer to the point about how long the fingerprints will be kept."
"I refer to a briefing I have received from the Home Office."
"It says that on a domestic level the United Kingdom currently erases the fingerprints of those granted asylum only when they have obtained indefinite leave to remain."
"Could I ask if the presidency would not agree to any further extension beyond the period which currently operates in Britain?"
"This issue comes up in many Member States."
"I can only say to him this afternoon that the presidency does not have the power to do what Mr Elliot is suggesting should be done."
"That would be a matter for consensus among the Member States in the Council and in other forums."
"I can only encourage Mr Elliot to make the important and valid case he makes on as many opportunities as he can to continually remind those who are making decisions in these matters of the importance of these considerations."
"That would specifically relate to the question of how long any records are retained."
"Question No 10 by GÃ©rard Caudron (H-0956/97)"
"Subject: Late payment on commercial debt"
"Late payment on commercial debt is an enormous inhibition to SMEs participating in the Single Market."
"What does the Council intend to do in this important area?"
"As the honourable Member may be aware, the Commission issued a Recommendation on 12 May 1995 concerning late payment on commercial debt, Doc."
"95/198/CE and published a Communication on this question on 17 July 1997."
"The Commission has also announced that a proposal for a directive on late payments will be transmitted to the Council in the near future."
"The Council will initiate the examination of such a proposal as soon as it is received."
"Mr President, I thank the President-in-Office for his reply, but he was quite right to assume that I knew of the existence of this recommendation, which is two years old, and of the existence of the communication, which is six months old."
"But it seems that in spite of these two texts, nothing has changed and late payments remain very much the same, since they vary from 19 to 75 days, with further delays of between 6 and 41 days."
"I would therefore like to see from the presidency a timetable and firm commitment, for there are distortions in competitiveness, even sometimes national preferential treatment, which is completely in contradiction with the single market."
"Can I say to the honourable Member that I understand his concerns."
"They are expressed by many throughout the European Union."
"There is often and always a debate within the Member States on action that can be taken on these matters especially in the small company sector."
"In some instances clearly action may be appropriate at Member State level but where there are international contracts that is something which should be examined very carefully to see if we can agree the context and the specific regulations that would help those small companies across international borders within our Union."
"I very much agree with the point which he has raised and I look forward, like he does, to the Commission proposal."
"When that is received I hope that I can reassure him that it will be dealt with as a matter of urgency by our presidency."
"I wonder whether the President-in-Office is aware that the British, but Cheshire-based, Forum of Private Business estimates that something like Â£20, 000 million is deprived from small businesses because of the problem of late payment which might otherwise be used in order to develop businesses and thus produce jobs."
"If that is true in the United Kingdom, imagine the situation throughout the European Union."
"I wonder what other measures, in concert with his colleague Mrs Barbara Roche and Commissioner Papoutsis, he is proposing to help ensure that the single market is properly completed?"
"I should like to say to the honourable Member that I was not quite aware of that statistic from the Forum for Small Business in Cheshire, though I was aware of the general trend in that important part of the European Union."
"I can only say to him that there are people in my own constituency in Newcastle-upon-Tyne - that other important part of the European Community - who feel equally strongly about this."
"I know that it is not a matter which is within one region or one country, it is something which affects companies over the whole of our Union."
"That is why I look forward to the Commission submitting regulations which clearly identify that it is better to have a responsibility at European-Union level and perhaps, on some issues, it is better to leave the responsibility with the nation states."
"It is important that we get that right so that we reach a formula which is recognized by small business people throughout the European Union as one which will be effective in making sure that their businesses are run more effectively."
"Of course, that is crucially important for job creation throughout the whole of our Union."
"Thank you very much, Mr Henderson."
"Since the time allocated to questions to the Council has now expired, Questions Nos 11 to 43 will be dealt with in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Relocation and investment in third countries"
"The next item is the second report (A4-0392/97), on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on relocation and direct foreign investment in third countries."
"Mr President, as you know, the report on relocation and direct investment was referred back to the Committee on External Economic Relations last December, where its general philosophy was once again approved by a large majority."
"This report attempts to take into account the environment in which we live and to fit in with modernity."
"Whether you are in agreement or not, you cannot ignore, for example, the Uruguay Round agreements, globalization, the implementation of the euro and the technological revolution which we are experiencing, if you wish to tackle the problem of relocations."
"Nor can you under-estimate the fluctuations in the dollar and its consequences."
"The arrival of the euro will therefore be a factor of monetary stability and it will contribute to avoiding competitive devaluations, thus limiting certain relocations within the context of the Union."
"But everyone also understands that an overvaluation of the euro would only strengthen the current trend for relocation to countries where the currency is undervalued."
"Consequently, it seems to me that, within the framework of the euro Council, the European political authorities will have to consider the consequences on relocations and foreign direct investment of the fixing of parity with the Eurodollar."
"Furthermore, questions arise concerning the countries which will not join the single currency on 1st January 1999."
"Mr President, in actual fact the report is in contrast with protectionist theories and it defends a strong idea: that of more loyalty within the context of globalization, as an answer to certain relocations."
"The conquest of new markets is an imperative for businesses, and investment is necessary to accompany this strategy."
"Consequently, the Commission must continue to pick up on all obstacles which prevent European businesses from adopting this policy."
"The database set up to this effect has been a great success."
"It is thus not a matter of rejecting what I would call offensive relocations."
"On the contrary, it is a matter of seeing how some uncontrolled relocations, whose aim is not to conquer a market but to bring about subcontracting, which very often leads to greater exploitation of the workforce and a massive cut in jobs within Europe, can be avoided."
"Loyalty should therefore be the rule for all, starting with the European Union."
"This loyalty must be practised with regard to European employees, who have the right to be better informed, above all before any site closures or relocation decisions are taken, hence the requested revision of Directive 94/95 C. Loyalty must be practised with regard to the European Union by companies which, when they receive Community or national subsidies, must not then be allowed to relocate a few months later."
"In this respect, our proposals aim to align us on the payment of structural funds with regard to fraud, to institute the compulsory reimbursement of subsidies if a company moves prematurely."
"Finally, loyalty must be the rule between the large European distribution firms, the manufacturers and the sub-contractors, through a contract of confidence encouraging a better exchange of information and thus a greater securing of loyal customers."
"We thus hope to limit the pressure exerted by some distributors in favour of relocation."
"European multinationals which set up abroad must be true vehicles of social development."
"We therefore propose to set up a code of good conduct based on respect for the ILO conventions on combating forced labour and the encouragement of trade union freedom."
"This code would not be an assortment of sanctions, but a company committing itself to this way of working might see its name quoted in the Official Journal or on the Internet."
"We all know that today the power of information is such that it enables pressure to be exerted on multinationals."
"Furthermore, at a time when the United States Administration is making the effort to develop a code of good conduct for American companies, would it not be appropriate for the European Union, the cradle of human rights, to be offensive in this regard also?"
"It is clear that, even if costs are reduced to a minimum, the salary of a European worker will never reach the same low levels as that of a Chinese worker."
"Costs are clearly too high in our countries but, and I repeat this, it is not in the costs of labour that the Union's advantage lies."
"Europe's advantage lies above all in technology and training."
"By launching a great European policy in these two areas, the Union could not only avoid certain relocations but, what is more, could contribute to further relocations, that is, towards Europe."
"I am counting on the decisions taken at the Luxembourg Summit on Employment to give a new impulse to this policy."
"Furthermore, we are also requesting the establishment of a code of good conduct with regard to taxation."
"It is certain that the abolition of tax loopholes would be one solution to uncontrolled relocations, but this is a long and difficult path."
"With regard to social harmonization, the Social Charter is, along with the social protocol which is integrated into the treaty, a good basis for a new departure for a social Europe."
"But a great distance remains to be covered to achieve harmonization of our pension and social security systems, which are the only effective way of avoiding some relocations."
"Mr President, this is all I wanted to say this evening."
"Mr President, the rapporteur has quite rightly presented the difficult relationships which can exist between foreign direct investments and industrial relocations."
"He has also placed this theme in a much larger context and this is something which we in Parliament have often discussed when debating world trade in goods and services."
"We cannot on the one hand move towards liberalization, globalization and the application of the full potential of modern transport and information technologies without, at the same time, advocating a regulatory system."
"This applies just as readily to the European internal market, to trade and commerce, which is so important for us all, and indeed to the world market."
"I think that given the current preoccupation for globalization, the connection between trade and direct investment is growing ever stronger, since business enterprises are now able to act globally, irrespective of whether they are multinationals, or whether they are large, small or medium in size."
"It must be pointed out that direct investment is not the same thing as simply exporting goods or placing contracts, since it involves a long-term commitment on the part of the enterprise in question."
"One is therefore entitled to ask more questions about the repercussions of direct investment projects than one would about the problems associated with trade and commerce."
"This is also bound up with the issue of investment outflow, which can inhibit growth and negatively affect employment."
"Fortunately one has to say that globalization has not yet taken such a hold on today's world as to create any real lopsidedness in the balance of investments."
"Here in the European Union we can still see that we are an attractive investment area and that this will be enhanced by the introduction of the euro and the completion of the internal market."
"From a European point of view this is without doubt something which will initially only affect specific branches and sectors of industry, or even individual companies, as far as their employment situation or level of economic activity is concerned."
"But just how much more has to be done on our part?"
"As the rapporteur quite rightly pointed out, there is a need for additional controls, the introduction of social and environmental clauses and greater fairness in competition, but we can also complete the global integration of the economy, commerce and investment, and create jobs - including those making explosives -, by regulating the relationship which exists with private enterprise."
"We not only need an international system to regulate competition but we must also have a code of conduct to control the increase in foreign production and the internationalization and globalization of the marketplace."
"Finally, transnational groups have created world monopolies in some products; these transnationals not only control one third of all goods and services, but what is more, the one hundred largest of them are responsible for 16 % of total world employment."
"I therefore consider it to be extremely important that we seek to prevent any restraint of competition and the setting up of monopolies, and that instead we introduce a code of conduct, together with regulations at both OECD and WTO level, to ensure that the net product of industry, as generated worldwide, and the increase in prosperity are not distributed in a one-sided way."
"I believe that this important Sainjon report is a perspective and forward-looking document because the problems of employment and adaptation which face the industrial nations are quite clearly taking on a certain structure, and indeed these are addressed in the report, and also because it does not defend a new form of protectionism - but instead advocates a comprehensive opening-up of the market and the introduction of international controls."
"We therefore simply have to support this report and make it a blueprint for the Commission and Council action which is needed at both European and international level."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Industrial relocations are instruments which business uses to take account of certain local conditions within the social market economy."
"They are not in themselves reprehensible."
"However, problems do arise when the conditions which apply at the new location contravene legal requirements, such as in the extreme case of child labour and forced labour, when women are subject to job discrimination in the relocated companies and when, for example, money laundering is involved."
"But industrial relocations can in some circumstances be necessary in order to open up markets, or produce goods, in new continents which are closer to the point of consumption."
"Europe's overall position, as well as that of most of its Member States - including my own country -, continues to improve and the introduction of the euro and other reforms will soon make the EU an even more attractive proposition."
"In the medium and long term, companies should in their own interest consider whether relocation outside Europe is an appropriate way of being able to supply the European market from a certain geographical distance."
"There are many reasons, including logistical ones, for resisting such a move."
"Some companies have already begun to realize the consequences of this and are now starting to relocate some of their business operations from Asia back to Europe."
"We support a discriminating free-market analysis of the wide-ranging factors which are responsible for the relocation of industrial production, and we oppose interventionist regulations which would impose a burden on companies."
"All measures which seek to restrict industrial relocations should therefore be carefully looked at to ensure that we avoid interventions whose impact would be disadvantageous for the economy."
"Specific framework conditions and a certain commitment on the part of the economy for company relocations can, however, be desirable for the rational deployment of public subsidies awarded in accordance with EU rules, or indeed for the prevention of fraud."
"We therefore emphatically support the recommendation that the Commission should propose a code of conduct based on these free-market principles."
"After the referral of the original report to the REX Committee on 6th November 1997, substantial amendments were introduced on our behalf in the course of subsequent constructive deliberations with the rapporteur."
"I would like to express my thanks to Mr Sainjon for the receptive manner in which he has dealt with our proposals and for the fact that he has accepted most of them."
"However, I must also refer to the amendment which he has submitted on the subject of the euro, namely Item 22a (new), which suggests that the European political authorities - whoever they are - should, by way of the European Council, reflect on the impact of establishing Euro-Dollar parity on foreign direct investments."
"I believe that this recommendation is misdirected and indeed it was rejected yesterday by Commissioner de Silguy during the debate on the Ruffolo report."
"The current Article 111, which was previously Article 109(1 and 2) of the EEC Treaty, cannot be interpreted in any way whatsoever to give the European Council currency-policy control in respect of the exchange rate."
"The formal agreement on exchange rate systems, which is the issue raised here, is quite a different matter and, if it came to it, would concern a new Bretton Woods institution - but not the price regulation of the Euro-Dollar exchange rate."
"In this area the European Central Bank alone has full and sole responsibility and its independence should not be prejudiced in any way."
"Article 109 emphatically states that the European Central Bank is not to receive instructions or recommendations from decision-making bodies, from Community bodies or institutions, from national governments of Member States or from any other quarter."
"This also applies to exchange-rate movements between the euro and the Dollar, whose regulation, if such is required, is incumbent only on the European Central Bank."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, on the 6th of November last year, the report by Mr Sainjon was referred back to the Committee on External Economic Relations at the request of the Liberal Group, and for three reasons."
"Firstly, the heading did not cover the contents."
"The report was supposed to have dealt with relocation and direct investments in third countries. Well, a major part of the resolution concerns socio-economic policy within the Union, or recommendations for the introduction of the euro."
"I am glad that Mr Swaiger endorses the criticism of in particular the euro."
"These issues fall outside the scope of this report and outside the competence of the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"The second reason the group had difficulties with this report concerns substantive basic assumptions."
"Whilst we are all striking out into the digital era with all its consequences, Mr Sainjon bases his resolution on an industrial society which no longer exists."
"Thirdly, the greater part of the amendments submitted by me, amendments which were vital to my group, were not accepted."
"Much to my regret I have to note that Mr Sainjon has ignored the Liberal Group's criticism, which obviously was shared by the majority of this Parliament on the 6th of November."
"He did not even bother to consult me, and did not accept the amendments which I submitted again."
"My group believes that the report as it is before us is still not acceptable."
"We will abstain, even though a few members will vote in favour."
"Mr President, on the committee I supported the rejection of the report for the following reasons:"
"Mr Sainjon speaks of the information society."
"In so doing he obscures from view the issue of global capitalism."
"The report mentions a regulated economy without offering any further explanation."
"We forget that a regulated economy is founded on the logic of capital."
"There must always be the highest possible return on capital."
"Capitalism is both a process to increase the value of capital and a social order structured round it."
"The European Union is the modern version of capitalism in Europe."
"Mass unemployment is an element in this system, in which European policies create a free working environment to exploit and manipulate people in the name of capital."
"We export this culture to other countries in the shape of company relocations and massive investment programmes."
"The report obfuscates the issue of capital, the profit-driven process, and sanctifies the market forces."
"The rapporteur has forgotten that the free market is often at odds with human dignity, and even requires us to ignore it all together."
"This explains why companies relocate to where the return on capital is greatest."
"That capitalism standardizes all, making everything uniform, is something Asia, for which it was once an alien culture, has recently learnt."
"Capitalism is not civilization or humanism, but the crude and ruthless pursuit of profit."
"Consider this: there is sixty times more loose cash circulating around the world that what would be required to pay off all world trade debts."
"Company relocations account for some of the latest expenses of capitalism. It is the world's casino, where the stake is often the dignity of the poor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a trades unionist recently said that come the year 2000, the employers' notion of the ideal textile factory will be one located on a ship which always ties up wherever salaries are lowest and furthermore - and there is plenty of evidence to support this - where work safety and trades union rights are limited, where social costs and social insurance are minimal, where profits at highest and where the market is the most promising."
"No-one can do anything about the last of these, namely the market situation."
"Businesses will naturally seek the shortest route to the consumer, but surely we do not want to see the European ship operating as a global pirate."
"A mechanic working for a European car manufacturer has a right to an uncontaminated, clean and socially-just workplace, no matter whether the factory is in Stuttgart or in Campinas down in Brazil."
"Neither can we see why the European board of a multinational company should justify its relocation to one of its branch establishments, where production costs will be cheaper, solely on the grounds that labour costs have forced such a move."
"For this reason we need controls and this is why we in the REX Committee organized a hearing and have submitted the report which is to be adopted today at the second attempt."
"It is certainly regrettable that at the last vote a number of members of this Parliament allowed themselves to be taken in by the monstrous argument that the report was full of social stuff and that this would have to be amended in committee."
"Well, this has now been done."
"The reported has been amended and, interestingly enough, the changes which have been made seem to take even more account of the social aspects."
"This is now common knowledge."
"After all, cars do not buy cars."
"But let me just make two points."
"Multinational companies need a code of conduct which enshrines the fundamental principles of the ILO conventions and environmental guidelines."
"All companies abiding by this code should be listed by name in the EU's Official Journal."
"We also call for companies which do not play by these rules to be excluded from EU subsidies and for this reason I would ask you to agree to our amendment."
"The same should indeed apply to export credit insurance, for surely those who really take account of human rights should find some reward for their particular entrepreneurial spirit."
"Let me just say something to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel."
"It is dreadful in my opinion that someone submitting amendments should a) not be present at the hearing and b) again fail to attend the final vote on the report, when really one should be there in order to present the amendments in question."
"You cannot treat our Committee this way."
"Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel can read this part in the Minutes, for I know that she understands German perfectly well."
"The Sainjon report is an excellent piece of work."
"I can endorse much of what Mr Schwaiger has said."
"We in the Committee on External Economic Relations support the report."
"Mr President, the return of the Sainjon report to the House from the Committee on External Economic Relations, with no significant amendments, confronts us once again with the minimalist approach to the phenomenon of relocation, which has been upheld by the rapporteur and which we deplore."
"Furthermore, this report is presented in a paradoxical way since in its explanatory statement, it tends to minimize the social and territorial impact of the practice of relocation and, in the motion for a resolution, to multiply the different palliatives, in an attempt to lessen the worst consequences."
"This range of measures, which are certainly interesting - code of good conduct, international global labels, contracts of confidence between manufacturer and distributor, measures to combat forced labour - are, first and foremost, many admissions of the pernicious effects of the process of relocation."
"Undoubtedly the reality of the phenomenon is difficult to comprehend statistically, but the approach retained by AndrÃ© Sainjon seems particularly restrictive."
"When you count the number of jobs wiped out in our countries by relocations, you have to take into account not only the products reimported from low salary countries but also products coming from highly developed countries with an average of 30 % of their components produced in low salary countries."
"In addition, the phenomenon of relocation cannot be considered in isolation from the pressure to reduce salaries which the choice of systematic free trade creates for employers, with businesses being forced to compensate, through automated production, for the exposure of the market to production from low salary countries."
"It is thus the whole package of costs that must be incorporated into the analysis of the social effects of relocation: only then will we have an idea of the scope of this phenomenon."
"The corrective measures that Mr Sainjon proposes do not measure up to this scope."
"It is particularly unfortunate that he has not wanted to explore the area of measures likely to reduce the attraction of reimportation."
"This is, however, one of the clear future ways for the most fruitful reduction of the scope of the pernicious phenomenon of relocation, if we truly want it."
"Mr President, could I begin by paying tribute to the work done by Mr Sainjon on this report."
"First of all, it very comprehensively embraces the subject matter and issues raised at the public hearing organized by the REX Committee last year."
"Also it is a pretty fair reflection of the spread of opinion in the REX Committee."
"For my part I would just like to highlight and expand upon some of the significant points made by the rapporteur."
"I welcome the call for a code of conduct applicable to European multinational companies to be drawn up by the Commission."
"We must ensure that it applies to subsidiaries and to subcontractors as well."
"To be truly effective there must be a role for the trade unions in monitoring its effectiveness."
"I have to confess that I am not entirely a fan of voluntary codes."
"I doubt very much if voluntary codes can be effective and I hope that the companies who are involved take note of that."
"Additionally, I would reinforce the rapporteur's demand for an inclusion of social and environmental clauses, international agreements and WTO rules."
"We have long supported that in the REX Committee."
"Given that we are in a period of slow growth and rising unemployment in Europe, it is essential that we address all the aspects of foreign direct investment and relocation."
"Mr Sainjon raises some interesting questions on the potential consequences resulting from the introduction of a single currency, I look forward to hearing the Commission's response to that."
"There is one other vital issue however which I believe should be addressed concerning relocation and that is the issue of transparency."
"I would submit that the big companies who lobby the Commission, who seek benign legislation or even deregulation or benefit from training programmes, have a duty and an obligation to be open and frank about their long term investment relocation plans."
"I believe that it is not too much to ask that they inform us well in advance not only where their planned foreign investment is to be but what market it is intended to serve and what impact it is likely to have on employment and unemployment in the European Union."
"I hope that when the Commission has discussions with multinational companies, as we know it does, it will raise these points with them because in the absence of such information any plans to systematically tackle unemployment are reduced to mere fire-fighting exercises."
"As soon as we deal with one incident another one springs up behind us."
"Finally, a word about the proposed multilateral agreement on investment."
"If this proposed agreement is seen to restrict social or environmental legislation or to hinder the socio-economic progress of developing countries then it will be fiercely and rigorously opposed and I would advise the Commission to take careful note of the growing concern surrounding the MAI."
"Mr President, the relocation of investments has to be seen with realism and constructively, seeking to reduce the risks and possible exploitation of the opportunities created, as is duly emphasized by the rapporteur, Mr AndrÃ© Sainjon, whom I wish to congratulate for that, without prejudice to the reservation made by Mr Schwaiger."
"We should begin by remembering that, in a worldwide context, the European Union is the most sought-after destination for direct foreign investments (45 % of the total), with an economic impact that is reflected in the broadly positive balance."
"For that reason, we have to accept the fact that European investment abroad is also substantial, although we should be particularly sensitive to investments in countries where labour is cheaper with production leading to unemployment in our countries."
"However, apart from concerning ourselves with the development of these countries, no doubt with the countries and the multinationals undertaking to comply with minimum rules in the social and environmental fields, the investments made may be converted into opportunities for us, particularly with the opening of markets to semifinished products in whose production we can continue as leaders thanks to the progress made in technology that can give us a unique position in the world."
"With the requirement resulting from a broader scope, the rapporteur's reference to the fact that the structural funds should be concentrated, more than in the past, on the promotion of research and technological innovation for companies established in the less favoured regions of the Union is particularly appropriate, in order to increase their competitiveness and ability to face the competition of the developing countries with emerging economies."
"In fact, only a balanced Europe, without the costs of great mergers and making use of all national and regional potential, can face the competition of a world we have to be more and more open to, in our own interests."
"This is a requirement for the whole Union and for each of the countries, particularly for Portugal, where there is so much to be done in the field of regional development."
"Mr President, I begin - like my friend Esko SeppÃ¤nen - by accepting that we are part of a capitalist system. I should, however, like to draw attention to one aspect of the report to which other colleagues have referred, and which seems to me to be fundamental: that in which the rapporteur, Mr Sainjon, suggests that social justice and sustainable development should be on a level with efficiency and economic stability."
"I should also like to stress what other colleagues have said: that the code of conduct should also apply to multinational companies."
"In the last analysis, that code of conduct embodies all a community's traditions: the struggle against forced labour, child labour, discrimination between men and women at work, and the encouragement of sustainable development."
"All of this, which is theoretically the basis of European policies, must also be a code of conduct for the multi-national companies."
"Not long ago, we were informed that nearly 200 million children work from the age of five."
"The European Union cannot allow this to happen in the multi-national companies with which it is connected."
"It is also necessary to revise EC Directive 94/45, because it seems to us, as the rapporteur put it very well, that it does not stipulate sufficiently clearly that workers should be consulted when a multi-national company moves work somewhere else."
"Right now, we in Spain have examples of sectors of the economy with good future prospects, such as telecommunications."
"But there is a Swedish company, Ericsson - and others following suit - which sell part of their production to small firms without guaranteeing the workers' rights and without guaranteeing the workers' future in that small firm."
"We believe that we should aim to prevent the multi-nationals from doing what they like with workers' rights, and the European Union has sufficient weapons to hand to prevent this."
"Mr President, when discussing the first report by Mr Sainjon on this topic, we already expressed our appreciation and our criticism."
"Most of the comments still apply, but the resolution has improved on certain points."
"The pronouncements on harmonization of tax conditions and a fiscal code of conduct have rightly been deleted during the follow-up discussion in the REX Committee."
"It is also a good thing that the idea that multinationals are obliged to advance social development, has been toned down."
"Yet the resolution remains characterized by dirigisme."
"The European Commission must draw up a code of conduct for European multinationals."
"There should be a European social label, and a confidentiality contract between distributers, manufacturers and subcontractors."
"Besides, we draw the line between the public and private domain in a very different way from colleague Sainjon."
"He obviously sees governments as a kind of solver of all problems."
"By mixing the public and private spheres, he ignores the nature and responsibilities of public administration on the one hand, and business on the other."
"A business is primarily an economic organisation, even if it has responsibilities in many areas such as environment and social policy."
"Yet businesses should not be awarded powers pertaining to public law, and they cannot, nor are they allowed to behave like government authorities."
"Because of the nature of public institutions, their opportunities to manage are limited."
"Authorities must set up conditions for the functioning of social relationships."
"As if it is self-evident, the rapporteur asks the European Commission to take all sort of measures, without considering whether the European Union is responsible for them."
"Looked at from within the subsidiarity principle, we are dealing primarily with responsibilities of the Member States."
"The European institutions are not state organisations but supernational authorities to whom a limited number of powers are delegated."
"The rapporteur loses sight of this, unfortunately."
"That is why we cannot support this report."
"Madam President. I agree with the rapporteur when he says in Item C of the Preamble that industrial relocation is a phenomenon which follows economic logic and is something which should not be ideologized."
"However, limits have to be imposed on economic logic for humanitarian, socio-political and labour-market reasons."
"A code of conduct for multinational companies would be welcome."
"But when it comes to combating child labour or forced labour, in other words modern slavery, then a code of conduct is not enough."
"No European firm should gain competitive advantage at the expense of maltreated children."
"As well as combating violations of human rights, which is a top priority matter, Europe should be doing everything in its power to make its economic situation more attractive by a massive increase in research expenditure."
"Europe cannot solve the problem of unemployment by way of protectionism and progressive isolationism."
"The structural funds should in future be used much more for technological research and innovation."
"Our objective in Europe must be to achieve competitive production costs in spite of higher labour charges."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question of relocation is a particularly burning issue in European public opinion."
"We have already discussed it at length here one November evening during a week's part-session. At that time we had to give our position, at the time of the vote, and it was only a small last minute procedure, quite a poor one at that, which referred it back to the Committee."
"Having already spoken on that occasion, I would this evening simply like, firstly, to applaud the rapporteur's proposals in the areas of research and technological innovation in particular for, as he said, these are factors in the relocation of industry in Europe. I say this as rapporteur currently working on a report on European industrial competitiveness."
"I would also like to repeat my agreement with the demand for a social clause in the international trading system in order to fight against all forms of exploitation, if not slavery, in the third world."
"Thirdly, I want to dispute the validity of the widely accepted belief that it is European labour costs which are primarily responsible for relocation."
"Finally, I want to remind you of what I had already said last November, regarding relocation within the Union."
"Indeed, this cannot be prohibited, but we must do all we can to speed up fiscal and social harmonization from the top."
"It is impossible to accept a single market where the rules of the game, and thus the costs, remain fundamentally different."
"Finally, and I will say this again and again, it is not possible to accept that companies which benefit from European subsidies can then relocate, and even less possible to accept that relocations are caused by the subsidies themselves, within Europe."
"There are frequent cases of this."
"I believe it is time, in this area too, that there should be a true European political will with regard to this."
"We could thus very concretely show public opinion that we are fighting uncontrolled relocations, which are economically and socially unacceptable."
"Mr President, this report raises an interesting phenomenon which illustrates Europe's difficulties in creating an expansive economy and full employment."
"The report should, however, have been able to remind people to a greater extent how total investments in the EU could increase."
"That is what is important."
"Relocations are only a small part of the whole."
"The report's attitude is defensive, trying to preserve something instead of creating much that is new."
"That does not contribute to the picture of a dynamic Europe. Rather it reinforces a stagnating perspective."
"This impression is reinforced by the proposals which are presented to prevent relocations."
"These are based not so much on how we should make Europe more attractive, but how we can make other countries less competitive."
"A number of regulations and codes are to be extended to apply to other countries."
"It is doubtful how effective this approach is."
"With all due respect for negotiations in the ILO, codes in the OECD, rules on aid, rules on unfair competition, structural funds, research subsidies and social clauses, in the end this long line is a list of all the kinds of efforts which many politicians cite in order to appear decisive and involved, but which still do not achieve the desired result."
"It is hardly going to reduce relocations and will not in any case increase overall investment in Europe."
"It is not possible to order companies and employment into existence, and that should be recognized by the European Parliament."
"In order for people to achieve the goal, general measures are required which make things easier for enterprise and new businesses, increase profitability of new investments, improve training and research programmes and make Europe competitive."
"Let me take paragraph 15 of the report as an example."
"There it says that the structural funds should to a large degree be aimed at creating an innovation and research-friendly environment for large and small companies in the area of information technology and that the Adapt programme should accelerate the training of workers to make them more able to react to technical change."
"That is quite excellent and very well intentioned, but it is still a risky thing to confuse such politically-controlled subsidy programmes with real measures to create the foundations for investment-friendly and investment-oriented business."
"Paragraph for paragraph, this report contains a lot which is interesting, but together it presents an incomplete perspective."
"The 25 paragraphs may in their number give the impression of something large, but there is a lack of basic paragraphs about how European competitiveness can be developed and thus the basis which is needed to counteract relocations and, even more importantly, to promote new investments."
"Mr President, I would like to concentrate on the impact of European relocation decisions as they impact upon developing countries."
"As the report rightly states, European investment has had a major impact on the fast developing countries of Latin America and Asia."
"But the flight of international capital in both of these continents has been a great source of instability, whilst ideas of a tax on such capital movements remain on the drawing board."
"Meanwhile, for the poorest African countries investment just is not happening, with multinationals taking Â£380 m more out of Africa over the last 20 years than they put in."
"Overall, we all know that foreign direct investment, in both its level and its potential, could have a far greater impact for good in the world compared to development aid."
"Yet today the processes of globalization too often exacerbate social inequality."
"That is why, as the rapporteur rightly states, we should support the ethical business movement."
"But in holding to these principles we must not be frightened to name those who failed to uphold just standards."
"Like the indigenous people who forced British gas to stop oil exploration in the Ecuadorean rain forest, or the Costa Rican banana workers who sued Shell for sterility caused by use of unsafe pesticides."
"Or perhaps the most notorious example of the world-wide consumer boycott was that against NestlÃ© for their irresponsible marketing of breast milk substitutes."
"The rapporteur rightly calls for a European code of conduct for multinationals and one that is developed in conjunction with international institutions."
"I am proud that the new government's international development White Paper in my own Member State, the UK, echoed these demands."
"But tonight we should call for Parliament to consider this question in much more detail and in particular to do so with far greater emphasis on the impact on and the partnership with the peoples of the developing world."
"At the November plenary session in Brussels, Sir Leon Brittan commented in detail on the first report."
"That allows me to be very brief since the core elements of the report have not changed very much."
"I should like to refer to two points that the Commission welcomes."
"Firstly, the report identifies the benefits that outward investments bring, both for the European Union and the countries which receive FDI."
"It highlights the benefits, as I said, and also underlines the more limited costs."
"However - and this is important - it does not simply dismiss these costs, but takes on board the concerns that a large part of public opinion and the industrial sector are expressing about relocation."
"It seems to the Commission that the report recommends a useful solution, which will further enhance the benefits of relocation while combating the potential negative effects."
"I would refer to two points."
"First, the code of conduct."
"The Commission welcomes the pragmatic idea of a code of conduct, particularly in third countries, in relation to social standards."
"However, the Commission does not consider that its role should be to devise or impose such a code of conduct on business."
"This is a job for businesses themselves."
"It is a pragmatic and voluntary code of conduct in which information is the major tool, rather than sanctions, which normally do not work."
"So the idea of publishing a list in the Official Journal or, even better, on the Internet, seems a good idea to the Commission."
"Secondly, I would like to remind you that the Commission has been seeking to improve international labour and environmental standards."
"As you know, the Commission proposed the specific initiative on trade and labour standards prior to the Singapore WTO ministerial conference."
"This initiative was, unfortunately, not adopted, but the Commission will continue to support the work of the ILO and to look at other means, for example, measures associated with the GSP, to further improve these standards."
"I have two further points to make."
"One concerns the exchange rate."
"I understand there was a major debate in committee."
"The Commission notes that Parliament adopted the Ruffolo report yesterday."
"We think that is the kind of text in which this issue should be dealt with and possibly solved."
"Following a remark by Mr Smith, the Commission can reassure him that we advocate the MAI provision, explicitly saying that countries should not lower their environmental or social standards in order to attract investments."
"The chances for the inclusion of such a clause are good."
"Having said that, the Commission welcomes this report."
"We are looking forward to continuing working with the European Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Fishery products from Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and Guiana"
"The next item is the report (A4-0385/97) by Mr Medina Ortega, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) establishing a system of compensation for supplementary costs with incidence on the sale of certain fisheries products originating from the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French Department of Guiana, due to the ultra-peripheral character of these regions (COM(97)0389 - C4-0451/97-97/0200(CNS))"
"Mr President, it seems that we are already getting used to discussing fishing reports into the small hours."
"As you know, many fishermen prefer that time of night precisely because of the good catches they can make then, although I do not know whether they conform with the strictest regulations for protecting the species."
"In short, I think it is not very good for the protection of the 'Parliamentarian' species and the species of Commissioner."
"In any case, Mr President, this is a report which I do not think will cause Parliament any serious difficulties."
"It is a regulation proposed by the Commission which aims to make permanent some support - which already existed on a temporary basis - for the outlying regions of the Community."
"I think that MPs are already fully aware of this."
"At the Maastricht Conference in 1992, a Declaration was added regarding the areas on the periphery of the Community and, in Article 299.2 of the new Amsterdam Treaty, it is pointed out that these regions have special characteristics relating to their remoteness, insularity, lack of energy resources etc. which justify a series of supportive measures."
"Within this context of support there are special programmes for these regions, specifically the Canary Islands, the Portuguese islands of the Azores and Madeira, the French islands of Guadeloupe, Martinique and RÃ©union, and the French department of Guiana."
"Support for these areas includes help for the fishing industry, laid down initially in a regulation of 1992, postponed in 1994 and 1995 and which should have been completed by 31st December 1997."
"I think that Parliament has been industrious in studying this matter."
"On the committee in November we approved the proposed regulation with its suggested amendments, and I think that tomorrow we shall be able to approve them at this Plenary session without any difficulty."
"On the Fisheries Committee, the European Commission's proposals were adopted without any problems whatsoever."
"The rapporteur and members of the Fisheries Committee were concerned about flexibility."
"That is, when making a temporary regulation into a permanent one, it would not make much sense to keep to the figures established initially, on the basis of a given situation which might have been valid in 1992."
"The development, both of production and fishing activity, together with marketing, changes in consumption etcetera, would justify certain adjustments."
"This is the meaning of the amendments adopted by the Fisheries Committee, Amendments Nos 1 to 9, which can be divided into three groups:"
"The first group of amendments - numbers 1, 2, 4 and 9 - refers to the inclusion of certain products from the island of RÃ©union."
"The island of RÃ©union is also on the extreme periphery of the Union and there would be no reason to exclude it."
"Amendments Nos 5, 6, 7 and 8 are an attempt to adapt the assistance to the Canary Islands to those products which are in effect being marketed at the moment."
"Finally, Amendment No 3 is a modest amendment considering that it merely reiterates something which already exists, this being the obligation to enforce the minimum limit of 30 metres depth for fishing on the continental shelf."
"As members of this Parliament will observe, the Fisheries Committee acted with the greatest concern for the strict budgetary requirements imposed, in order not to exceed the financial limits."
"Our committee may have been too punctilious and respectful towards the authorities at the Budget Committee and with regard to the Community's own budgetary forecasts."
"It could be said, perhaps, that since the amendments approved for the Canary Islands, numbers 5 to 8, are so strictly drawn up, they might allow little margin for subsequent development."
"Amendment 9, which assumes that in order to be able to give additional aid to the island of RÃ©union it would have to be deducted from assistance to another outlying French region, would cause difficulties for that other outlying French region."
"Probably the most interesting observation - and it was a pity that it came so late - was that made by the representative of the European Commission at our parliamentary committee on 25th November 1997."
"He pointed out that perhaps the regulation could have adopted a much more flexible formula, with certain financial controls, but without specifying for each species and at each moment what quantity was subject to regulation."
"This concern to combine flexibility with strict budgetary guidelines appears to govern Amendment No 12 from Mr Souchet, on behalf of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations; Amendment No 13 from Mr Baldarelli on behalf of Group of the Party of European Socialists; and my own Amendment No 14, also on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which aim to replace or modify Amendment No 9, which had caused irritation in the French department of Guiana."
"The rapporteur thought that these amendments were correct."
"In particular, he prefers his own amendment, number 14, but any of these appears to improve the situation so as not to cause a confrontation between the island of RÃ©union and the French department of Guiana."
"Amendments Nos 15 and 16, submitted by Mr Baldarelli, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, attempt to combine this flexibility with the strict budgetary guidelines, and I also think that they are acceptable."
"I think that they help to allow for this flexibility in a regulation which is going to become permanent."
"On the other hand, the rapporteur considers that neither Amendment No 10, from Messrs. d'Aboville and Aldo, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe, nor Amendment No 11, from Mr Souchet, on behalf of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, on species and sizes of fish and prawns etcetera, belong in a regulation about help with marketing."
"Their place would be in a regulation on assistance with the protection of fishing species and the rapporteur considers, therefore, that they should not be approved."
"Finally, Mr President, I do not know where this regulation will lead once it is adopted but, bearing in mind the remark by the representative of the European Commission and that, subsequently, the Council will have to adopt the final regulation, I hope that neither the Commission nor the Council consider the amendments submitted by the Fisheries Committee - which could easily be accepted tomorrow - as a very tight straitjacket."
"On the contrary, when drawing up the final text of the regulation, a clause should be introduced allowing for real flexibility."
"That is to say, every time we want to transfer assistance from one party to another, or from one item to another, we should not have to modify the regulations."
"Obviously this was not the Commission's original idea."
"I do not know what formula could be chosen."
"It is possible that the Commissariat could explain whether it has any ideas about this or, simply, if it is going to restrict itself to approving the amendments as they may be approved tomorrow by the Plenary session of Parliament."
"I think that the amendments are positive and constructive and, of course, I wish to thank the Commission for proposing this type of regulation, which will doubtless be favourable for the outlying areas of the Community."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to say a word of thanks and appreciation for Mr Medina's commitment to defending the interests of the ultra-peripheral regions, exemplified by the report being discussed."
"The EU's recognition of the need to establish fair conditions for the marketing of certain fishery products, in order to compensate for the disadvantages deriving from remoteness, has been co-substantiated since 1992 by means of an aid scheme systematically extended to 1997."
"The ultra-peripheral regions of the EU have common structural characteristics, placing them in the group of regions covered by Objective 1, characterized, as you know, by presenting a per capita GDP below 75 % of the Community average."
"The great remoteness of the fishery products marketing regions, the small size of the markets for marketing these products and the increase in production costs related to the high cost of transportation, associated with unfair competition resulting from commercial agreements which the EU has arranged with third countries, obtaining commercial advantages in relation to those regions, make the survival of the processing industries and a whole chain of workers directly or indirectly connected with them dependent on the compensatory aid scheme."
"With regard to Madeira and the Azores, owing to the incentive policies, it has been possible not only to consolidate but in some cases to increase the industrial fabric harmoniously, enabling surplus local production, mainly tuna, mackerel and black swordfish, to be marketed, giving prospects of sustainable development to the processing companies."
"And so we welcome the Commission's motion and the amendments introduced by the rapporteur and we keenly ask for its approval by Parliament and Council, so as to maintain stability in the fishery sector and in this way also stimulate the creation of new jobs."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we, the Group of the European People's Party, find these measures correct and justified."
"Essentially, they aim to continue measures existing in previous regulations whose validity ended in December last year."
"Their object, as we know, is to compensate the ultra-peripheral regions for the additional production costs and for the processing costs and, mainly, for the costs of marketing species of fish whose market lies outside those regions, which are normally very small and very restricted markets and so they normally have to export to the European continent and to the Common Market."
"As we all know, we are talking about fairly poor, ultra-peripheral regions with very low levels of income, all classified in the Objective 1 regions, as stated by Mr Correia, and we are also talking about permanent structural situations, levels of disfavour unfortunately not wiped out, not eliminated in the short term."
"On that account, in our opinion, this aid should be regarded as permanent and not just as temporary aid."
"The aid should be subject to periodic assessment, which should always take into consideration the development of catches, of existing stocks and, naturally, also, the development of the markets and allow these permitted levels of aid to be increased at any time, if there is a favourable trend in production and catches and a favourable market trend."
"Several proposals have been put forward to extend some of this aid to fish from Reunion Island; we can understand this and approve of these intentions, but we understand that financing would have to be found for that island and for that situation, adequate financing, without prejudicing the current beneficiaries of this aid situated, as we know, in Guinea, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands."
"The Group of the European People's Party would like to thank M Medina Ortega for the fantastic, highly positive, greatly discussed and highly effective work he has carried out."
"It agrees with the amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries, but is voting against some amendments presented after the part-session, mainly Amendment Nos 10 and 12."
"I hope that in the future the Commissioner present today will follow the situation of these peripheral regions attentively, as she always does, and propose special measures aimed at them, as fish is the strategic and endogenous resource for the development of these ultra-peripheral and insular regions."
"Mr President, the ultra-peripheral regions suffer from the handicap of remoteness."
"Since transportation of their produce destined for the European market causes additional costs, to make this produce competitive with rival products from third countries, it is necessary to grant them certain compensatory measures, as Mr Medina Ortega has noted."
"It is precisely because the problems encountered by producers in Reunion are of this nature that we proposed the inclusion of this region within the parameters of the compensation system."
"Reunion is the furthest ultra-peripheral region of Europe."
"Situated in the middle of the Indian Ocean, in an area where stocks are not over-exploited, an abundant source of tuna and swordfish is to be found, accessible by the local long line fishing method, tradable on the international market, and important, if not vital, in terms of jobs in an area which has been seriously hit by unemployment."
"But the marketing, in Europe in particular, of fresh produce is handicapped by the freight costs and packaging costs."
"This situation causes the long line fishermen of Reunion to settle for the local market, which brings about direct competition between long line fishing and traditional fishing."
"In order to ensure that these two fields of fishing can continue side by side, it is necessary to promote the export of long line fishing produce."
"That is the reason why I would like to thank Mr Medina Ortega for his Amendment No 14 which takes account of this situation."
"Furthermore, within the context of the discussions on this report in the Committee on Fisheries, we met a delegation of traditional fishermen from Guiana, who came especially to draw our attention to the problems of this region."
"There, some industrial outfits do not hesitate to fish for shrimps near the coast, in waters less than 30 metres deep."
"By so doing, they put resources at risk by devastating young shrimp stocks, which are found precisely in this coastal area."
"Another disastrous consequence is that this practice causes an additional catch whose sale destabilizes the local market."
"These are the reasons which have brought my colleague, Blaise Aldo, and myself to propose that the granting of subsidies for Guianese shrimp fishing be made conditional on the product being of a reasonable size, that is, adult, and whose fishing does not put in jeopardy stocks as a whole."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's motion to reintroduce the scheme to provide compensation for fishery products in ultra-peripheral regions deserves our natural support, as does the report and amendments proposed by the Committee on Fisheries."
"The Commission's proposal, however, goes to prove today, in 1998, that we were right three years ago when we discussed the same proposed reintroduction for the period ended 31 December 1997."
"It now shows that it was possible for an elementary act of justice to be drawn up in 1995 providing compensation for those involved in fishing deep-sea species in the Azores and swordfish and mackerel in Madeira, in addition to the natural proposed reintroduction of compensation for the tuna sector."
"The sectors now supported on these peripheral Portuguese islands were already claiming compensation three years ago, and we repeated them, having amendments approved that reflected those concerns."
"On that account, we should not forget today that we all agree in 1998 on the responsibility held by the regional authorities that forgot the deep-sea fishermen in the Azores and the swordfish and mackerel fishermen in Madeira three years ago, not giving continuity to the needs of these local economic sectors along with the Commission."
"Nor should we forget a certain insensitivity on the part of the Commission which then failed to agree to amend its proposal, although, in my opinion, it could and should have done so."
"And, finally, we should not forget certain omissions and obstructions or diversion tactics that appeared or were introduced here during the discussion that then began in this Parliament."
"Now is the time for justice to be restored, even if it is three years late."
"We cannot fail to congratulate ourselves for this."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Regulation is in fact based on an extremely strong legitimacy."
"This legitimacy has been present in the text since the Treaty of Rome, repeated in the accession treaty for Spain and Portugal, renewed once more in the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Conference of Maastricht and finally taken up in the Treaty of Amsterdam, even if this has yet to be ratified."
"In other words, there is continuity in the very spirit of this text and in this system of compensation."
"Furthermore, the European Union, and the European Parliament in particular, recognized the need to take the specificities of these remote regions into account and adopted the POSEI programmes in 1989 and 1991."
"Finally, it can be noted that there is no particular suspicion regarding these measures, which confers further legitimacy on them."
"The European Union, and the European Parliament in particular, can thus take pride in the significant aid it has brought to these territories and to activities which are sometimes the primary source of export receipts."
"When you consider this approach, marked both by generosity but also by economic reason and a concern for justice aimed at correcting the realities imposed upon us - particularly geographic realities - it is difficult to understand that from the moment when you include a territory, perfectly legitimately, it implies taking away from others some of the aid you were going to provide."
"The previous speeches have clearly demonstrated that it cannot be defensible to consider withdrawing the required finances from the overseas French departments as a whole, even from the ultraperipheral regions as a whole, in order to help the Reunion fishermen compensate for their handicap."
"Furthermore, with regard to Guiana in particular, I would like to draw your attention - and I know that the Committee on Fisheries will understand me entirely, because it is an open and dynamic Committee - to the need to consider different approaches."
"If we have to perpetuate this system, it is also important to encourage the different economic operators to work together, to understand each other and to organize together in order to manage, in the common interest, resources which are certainly not inexhaustible but which also have their own ethological laws."
"We must question ourselves on the results of research, on our knowledge of stocks, on the perception of interests, not only of one single resource - in this case shrimps - but also for other resources, and see under what circumstances contradictions, even antagonisms, can arise when there are superimposed fishing zones for shrimp and fish."
"It is thus a long term job that the Committee will take on board but it will carry it out admirably."
"Mr Medina Ortega's sober, precise and convincing report can only persuade us that this work will be undertaken in the interests of all."
"In the short term, it is clear that this system must be maintained, that justice must be established - that you can certainly not impoverish some in order to establish justice for others - and that we must ensure, in the future, common management of resources, by the fishing professionals to begin with."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this proposal made by the Commission and this report drawn up with the knowledge and reflection shown by Mr Medina Ortega, the door is opened to a framework of financial aid for the marketing of deep-sea fishery products from the Azores, maintaining support for the tuna industry."
"The allocation of aid to deep-sea fisheries was supported by us in February and March 1995, against the opinion of the then rapporteur and the then regional government of the Azores."
"On that occasion, the regional government of the Azores placed the responsibility for not including deep-sea fishing on the Commission, stating publicly that the Commission had not agreed to provide aid for deep-sea fishing."
"Now, with new governments in the region and in Portugal, what we supported in 1995 is being implemented."
"Congratulations to the current regional government for the strategy of dialogue and responsible demand followed up with the Commission, whose proposal now being discussed, maintaining aid for 10 000 tonnes of tuna, for the first time extends the aid to 3 500 tonnes of deep-sea species."
"It is always possible to ask for more, but this is already one step forward."
"The economic and social impact of fishing, particularly on employment, and the special conditions of the remoteness of the Azores region justify it."
"This is also understood by the Council of Ministers, which is now competent to give final approval for this aid, aid reinforced with the inclusion of the concept of remoteness in the Treaty of the European Union as defined in Amsterdam."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the detailed and explanatory analysis of the economic conditions endured by the outlying regions, which Mr Medina Ortega has included in his report, avoids our having to speak at length about the appropriateness of this proposal which was submitted by the Commission."
"Anybody who reads the reasons set out in that report will be able to confirm that this aid is justified and needs to remain in place."
"Being an island in itself, and more so when accompanied by particular remoteness with regard to the main centres of economic activity, contributes towards creating, in a more or less extreme form, certain peculiarities in the production of islands and their commercial interchange with the rest of the world."
"This has doubtless produced a certain specialisation in the products which are fundamental to these islands' economies, amongst which fishing products obviously play a very important part."
"Tuna from the Azores, squid from the Canaries or crustaceans from Guiana are some examples of the industries to which the inhabitants of their respective islands have turned in order to ensure their future livelihoods."
"As the traditional basis of these peoples' economies, such specialisation should be respected and consolidated."
"This cannot be done without special financial provisions which allow the islands to operate within the markets on an equal footing, by compensating for the differences in costs produced, for example, by transporting such products to the centres of distribution and consumption."
"On the other hand, the support contained in the POSEICAN, POSEIMA and POSEIDOM programmes has enabled the industries to develop from merely extracting the fish to exporting it in the form of semi- or fully processed products, creating new prospects of development and wealth."
"It would, however, be desirable for the Commission to pay more attention to the individual peculiarities of some of these regions whose extreme remoteness in many cases may make their voice more difficult to hear."
"This has happened in this case with aid to Guiana which did not take into account, as it should have done, the actual protection of the interests of its local fishing industry."
"The presence of representatives from Guiana on the Fisheries Committee demonstrated this region's concern to obtain a system of support which ensures respect for the continuing biological viability of its fishing resources, something which the Commission should defend in principle."
"We hope that the amendments submitted by various groups with the aim of resolving this question, amendments which we support, may contribute towards alleviating this situation, which should not arise in future."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the measures proposed for this regulation are simply the updating and continuation of those adopted in 1994 and 1995 within the framework of the POSEIMA, POSEIDOM and POSEICAN programmes."
"These measures only set out to remedy the damage caused in the fishing industry by the extra costs incurred by the particularly restricting circumstances of the outlying regions."
"And they are measures which, in the course of time, have proved effective to a certain extent."
"They seem to be common-sense measures."
"There are third countries which enjoy advantageous agreements with the European Union and it would be difficult not to give permanent support to the community's fishing industry when this is provided to third countries which are not members of the Community."
"In short, without such measures, the Canary Islands' fishing industry, which is increasingly a minority interest as it is, would end up by disappearing altogether."
"The best thing I can say in defence of these measures is that without them a large part of the fishing industry in the outlying regions would be lost and that in such fragile economies no sector is negligible."
"Mr President, This regulation, as we have heard, affects regions on the extreme fringe of the EU, such as the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands, French Guiana and others."
"Because of their remoteness these regions incur additional costs in the marketing of certain fishery products."
"We now need to update and maintain the current system of subsidy controls which are designed, quite simply, to balance the additional costs actually incurred in the marketing of fishery products against those of other EU regions."
"This proposal has been accepted by the Committee on Fisheries."
"An interesting proposal in some amendments is for subsidies to be redistributed along more flexible lines, whereby the total amount of aid remains the same."
"The report is very up-to-date inasmuch as it addresses structural policy aspects of the fisheries sector."
"We have on several occasions complained of the fact that the fisheries industry is scarcely mentioned in Agenda 2000, while the Commission Work Programme for 1998 only refers to it in passing."
"As a result of this we were motivated to focus now on the structural problems affecting the fisheries sector."
"The long-running alignment programme and the technical measures agreed in 1997 can only have a positive effect on the lives and jobs of those working in the fisheries sector once the structural problems affecting this industry are tackled and ultimately solved."
"But to do this we obviously need money."
"Parliament has already played its part in 1997 by drawing up a forward-looking report on European fisheries policy after 2002."
"Two further initiative reports are to follow in 1998."
"That which deals with industrial fisheries will again produce a passionate debate, but the outcome will show that we are well able to tackle the technical problems affecting the fisheries industry and that we are all set to solve the conflict which exists in this sector, and that this House has the will to achieve its objectives."
"Controversial funds have now been set aside under international agreement."
"Let us then take a cool and calculated look at the situation and let us employ the full force of the Budget Committee and of all other members of this House so that we can ultimately achieve the longed-for and legislatively necessary decision on strengthening the position of Parliament."
"A report on the islands is currently being debated."
"A report on coastal areas is to follow."
"The aim here is to highlight and resolve the local infrastructure problems so that jobs and production centres in these unstable regions can be maintained and built up to the advantage of the fisheries industry."
"To this end we shall continue to work as before, and perhaps in an even more focused way, which I believe was the intended message of Mr Ortega's report."
"You can already see, Madam President, that all the political groups and countries support your proposal."
"I therefore wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, and yourself Mrs Bonino, for the success and appropriateness of your proposal."
"I particularly agree with the proposals made regarding fish-farming and squid, and I understand the concern you express, Mrs Bonino, to the Government of the Canary Islands in your letter of 27th December last, about responsibility for the biological ""desert' in the territorial waters of Morocco."
"The very heading of the proposed regulation is in itself fortunate."
"It speaks of compensation for additional costs."
"For years we have been advocating the need for the outlying regions to have their shortages and natural disadvantages recognized so that they can become part of the internal market and benefit from their participation in it."
"We have come a long way, not without set-backs, but in the end we have achieved success."
"I should like to draw attention to the fact that these extra costs which the Commission wishes to compensate are not only relevant to the present moment but are structural in nature."
"That is why I consider it necessary - as the Commission recognises - to maintain this kind of aid in the future as well."
"For some outlying territories - for instance the islands of Pico in the Azores or Lanzarote in the Canary Islands - fishing is not just another of its economic resources, but forms part of its very life, culture and traditions."
"Because of its economic significance, and the number of jobs it creates, this is not just another figure but part of the strategic resources which are vital for such support to enable the industry to survive in the outlying regions, which suffer from the highest rates of unemployment in the Union and are all areas under Objective 1 on account of their low level of income."
"That is why it is necessary to maintain current policies, and this is what the regulation we are discussing today finally proposes."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the excellent report now being discussed relates to the aid to be given to one of the sectors of economic activity of the ultra-peripheral regions of the EU which might not be that of greatest expression in some of those regions."
"However, it is not the most lacking in aid, in view of the environmental and social strategic importance of the fishery sector and its production, processing and marketing."
"It is a special system for providing financial compensation for the additional costs incurred owing to remoteness, provided within the framework of the POSEIMA."
"The achievement made in the last revision of the Treaty of the European Union should be pointed out, as it led to the inclusion in this Treaty of the wording for the ultra-peripheral regions, the recognition of the specific characteristics of insular regions separated from the continent, separated from the European market to which they export most of their products, providing for measures to be taken regarding the fishery policy in Article 229 paragraph 2 of that same Treaty."
"Some of the reasons given and others that could be given fully justify the belief that the measures now taken should not be considered transitional or temporary but, on the contrary, should be understood in a logic of constant geographical conditions and not just that but highly penalizing, thus deserving permanent and definitive measures."
"It is right for aid to be extended to other ultra-peripheral regions not yet contemplated, but it is essential and advisable to point out that this aid should never be provided at the expense of the ultra-peripheral regions already benefiting in some way."
"In the autonomous region of Madeira, tuna, black swordfish and mackerel are the species that deserve the aid granted, which at the moment is no more than ECU 1.6 million."
"This incentive policy permitted the consolidation and implementation of an harmonious industrial fabric, enabling the surplus local production to be marketed."
"An appropriate revision should be made of the species and the amounts to be provided, based on the development of production and the production, processing and marketing costs."
"The report and most of the amendments being discussed deserve our consideration and agreement."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Medina Ortega and the Commissioner for their excellent work."
"With regard to Amsterdam, you will understand that one of the most significant changes for me is the inclusion in the Treaty of the European Union of the article relating to the ultra-peripheral regions, recognizing that their specific characteristics require specific measures."
"This is the right decision which the European Parliament has been involved in from the outset."
"When some people wonder how to convey the new possibilities opened up by the Treaty, the answer is easy."
"Successful experiments constitute a good starting point."
"Examples of this are the Community initiative REGIS and the POSEIMA, which is precisely the instrument enabling the measure being examined to be adopted."
"The POSEIMA has positively but insufficiently contributed towards the Azores feeling more a part of the European Union."
"It is in this framework that the measure being discussed is incorporated; it cannot be temporary, as the structural conditions that fail to favour these regions result from the their separation from the European market to which they export their products."
"They have to become final on that account, because the geography will not change."
"With regard to Mr JosÃ© ApolinÃ¡rio's speech, I would like to say that he has a short memory, because at the time the European Parliament approved his amendment proposals, which I did not agree with, and the Commission failed to include them in its report."
"However, his proposal is not what we are discussing here."
"What we are discussing here is far more along the lines of what I supported in his proposal, because I supported that tuna should remain untouchable and that deep-sea fish should increase, but the MEP insisted that tuna should be withdrawn to make room for the deep-sea fish."
"So what he said is only half the truth."
"One final point: with regard to the ultra-peripheral regions mentioned in the Treaty of the European Union, it is clear that solutions such as this and others, including those relating to the agricultural sector, have to be developed, as they have achieved excellent results."
"This is the right path."
"And so I fail to understand the lack of references to the REGIS and the POSEIMA in the Agenda 2000, a situation that needs to be changed and which Mr JosÃ© ApolinÃ¡rio can help to do."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, effectively, as the rapporteur has pointed out, the frequent appearance on the agenda of items relating to fisheries threatens to turn us all into a kind of club of friends of fisheries, a club which is perhaps a little exclusive, with the same people always there, but which also has its positive aspects, in the sense that one is talking with parliamentary colleagues who know this dossier inside out."
"This relieves me, for example, of returning to the motivations and the content of this regulation, which, moreover, you have illustrated in detail. However, I think it is appropriate to dwell on some of the amendments."
"The general philosophy of this regulation has been underlined by each of you, both from the fair treatment angle and as a kind of solution."
"Other than this, the proposal also mirrors developments over the last few years, hence including new species; it is a proposal then, from a certain evolutional point of view, which is not limited to a pure and simple repetition."
"More specifically, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4, while Nos 3, 5, 5, 7 and 8 perhaps require a touch of redrafting."
"As regards the island of Reunion, the Commission accepts the amendments in principle, but we are not yet in a position to give a technical definition of the methods and quantities because the French request arrived very late; the Commission has however sent a mission to the island of Reunion, but we are still waiting for further information which we have asked the French authorities for."
"Your amendments will then be taken up in the modified proposal that the Commission will have to present."
"But I must also emphasize that in principle the Commission accepts this inclusion."
"So when the Commission presents a modified proposal, on the basis of both the amendments and the new information, we feel that Amendments Nos 13 and 15 will then be superfluous."
"As regards the purpose of Amendments Nos 10 and 11, the Commission cannot but share this objective, because they refer to the conservation of resources, but frankly it seems to me that it would be better to deal with this under the implementing regulation."
"This does not seem to us the appropriate context in which to insert this type of consideration, above all if it must deal with the technical methods intended to achieve the conservation of resources."
"Article 6 seems sufficiently precise about the nature of the report to be presented by the Commission, while Amendment No 16, which concentrates only on the financial aspects, could bring a partial evaluation of the measures in question."
"On the final point I am addressing Mr Langenhagen, in particular: I am perfectly aware - we say this every time - of the European Parliament's request to reach a codecision on the agreements in due form."
"For the moment we must make a virtue of necessity and live with the existing rules."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, the Commission hopes that, in a situation of temporary regulation which is becoming permanent, this regulation, which you have given a positive welcome, can also give the sector that stability of prospects which is one of the cardinal elements of a vision, also economic, of the entire fisheries sector."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"VAT on telecommunications"
"The next item is the report (A4-0376/97) by Mr Cox, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC concerning the value added tax system applicable to telecommunications services (COM(97)0004 - c4-0100/97-97/0030(CNS))."
"Mr President, this is a short proposal from the European Commission - in terms of reports for which I have been rapporteur during several years, it is perhaps the shortest."
"It is also one of the most complex."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy believes that the Commission proposal is a timely one and in that regard welcomes it."
"It is a useful response to a global telecommunications revolution which in substance has bypassed some of the relevance and nature of the existing VAT system as it applies to that sector."
"Certainly the technology has outpaced the VAT design."
"The proposal sets out to address a very fundamental problem, namely that European Union telecom suppliers pay value added tax in respect of their EU clients but third country suppliers pay no such tax in respect of their EU clients."
"At least that was the case at the point of introduction of the proposal."
"It meant that there was an unfair market distortion which was damaging to EU telecom suppliers and that there was a loss of Member State revenue."
"It was a dynamic loss because this is a growing sector and, over time, the problems would deepen, especially in the context of the liberalized market we face from now on."
"However, the immediate urgency lying behind the Commission's proposal has in part been addressed by 15 parallel, identical derogations agreed by the Council on 17 March last year."
"Consequently, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy was of the opinion that this affords a pause for thought, a chance to clarify questions and issues, and then to see how to deepen and perhaps add value to the basic Commission proposal which we have been considering."
"The advantage of the Commission proposal was that there would be a single VAT registration for suppliers."
"But this is counterbalanced in practice - and the report deals with examples at some length - by the cumbersome and costly value added tax recovery procedures under the Eighth VAT Directive."
"The Commission has recommended against a reverse charge mechanism and the consequence therefore is, if you look at the dossier in detail, that clients would need, if they purchase from EU suppliers from another Member State, to pre-fund value added tax bills and to wait for a number of months to get those refunds back."
"Since the Council has partly addressed the matter - although I know the Commission has argued before our committee that it has not done so in a way that would be satisfactory in the long haul - we believe that time is now available to the Commission to reflect and perhaps to make one or two additions to this proposal."
"Firstly we would call on the Commission to revise the Eighth VAT Directive with regard to the cumbersome and costly refund procedure."
"It is a timely moment to pick up on that particular concern, which certainly was a major concern of telecom suppliers who spoke to me as rapporteur and who had contact with colleagues in the committee."
"Secondly, because we now have liberalization of the market, because the Commission is of the view that the Council's derogations cannot be sustained over the long haul and could, indeed, even create some problems in terms of WTO conditions."
"I believe it is worth trying to identify precisely where the weaknesses are and where they need to be filled."
"Finally, we explored whether it might not be appropriate to consider for telecoms a pioneering notion of a single VAT rate."
"We have asked the Commission to reflect on those elements and then to bring forward a revised proposal which would enhance the current basic proposal."
"In essence, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy regards what has been proposed by the Commission as positive, believes what the Council has done affords pause for thought and would like that time to be used to enhance the value of the proposal and to make it more comprehensive and more acceptable."
"I would commend the amendments to the Commission."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Cox both on his report and his explanation of it here, in this Chamber."
"I think it is a most complex subject and difficult to explain."
"I would be most interested, Commissioner, to hear your reaction to the suggestions that Mr Cox has made."
"It seems to me that both the Commission proposal and the Council proposal have certain short- and medium-term disadvantages."
"Mr Cox has explained very clearly that the technology has outpaced the VAT systems."
"There have been most serious handicaps for European Union telecommunications operators and a most serious and disadvantageous distortion of competition."
"We can quite understand why the Council has put into place the derogations that Mr Cox has outlined."
"Under the Commission proposal - the change to the Sixth VAT Directive - there will be a shift in the place of taxation to the place of establishment of the recipient of the services, the customers' base, and away from that of the supplier, the telecommunications company's base."
"The problems that Mr Cox has identified about the cumbersome and costly VAT recovery procedures, on which I and many Members get many letters, clearly is a major obstacle."
"I think that Mr Cox's approach is correct, but I would be interested to hear the Commissioner's reaction to the question of how to make progress towards a definitive VAT system and how to recover VAT without undue cost and bureaucracy, to the question of the impact of telecoms liberalization on fiscal receipts - because this is a hugely growing market and the fiscal implications for chancellors really are very considerable."
"I would also like the Commissioner to comment on the effects of the Council's derogations."
"Mr Cox has mentioned possible conflicts, which I think are more than probable, with the GATT clauses and the specific World Trade Organization agreement."
"Although, clearly, the Council proposal can hold in the short-term - which, in a sense, removes some of the pressure both on this Parliament and the Commission - nevertheless the problem will exacerbate rather than diminish."
"Clear proposals from the Commission would be received with great interest by members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"Mr President, my group supports Mr Cox's report and also the amendments proposed."
"We had cause for concern: Europe's disadvantage in relation to competitors from abroad."
"And so we understand the exceptions established by Council."
"Curiously enough, we have gone for a solution along the lines of the ""principle of fate' , only in that way avoiding market distortions, besides avoiding the problems resulting from the lack of harmonization of taxes and the lack of an income compensation mechanism, which is essential in taxation on consumption."
"Finally, you may wonder whether it is not a question of virtualities that we need to continue using VAT in general, postponing the adoption of the final system according to the ""principle of origin' until the complete harmonization of taxes is established and a safe system of compensation is assured."
"In this specific case, we are justified in accepting the Commission's proposal with the addition of the new line s) to Article 9 paragraph 2 of Directive 7788/EEC; but as we agreed, its application should depend on a report to be submitted to Council and the European Parliament in which the Commission will have to explain in detail all the progress made in the direction of the final system, the impact of the liberalization of telecommunications on tax receipts and the effects of the exceptions introduced in the meantime."
"Mr President, until recently we were working with a VAT regime which was bad for European competition and for the telecom suppliers within the Union."
"On numerous occasions attention has been drawn to the future taxation problems in this sector, and I think we will frequently have to exchange views on this issue."
"The Cox report contains a lucid analysis of the pros and cons of the Commission's proposal, and of the temporary arrangement made by the Council."
"At the moment 15 identical derogations are used for all Member States, which is acceptable in the short term."
"The present Commission proposal also contains some traps, such as the costly procedure to reclaim VAT."
"That is why it would be sensible to implement in particular Mr Cox's Amendment No 5, in which the Commission is asked to have another thorough look at the problems concerning claims in connection with a definite VAT arrangement without unnecessary bureaucracy; at the effect of liberalization and the effect of the 15 derogations; and to submit a new directive to the Parliament and to the Council on the basis of the analysis."
"Mr President, I think we can allow ourselves this amount of time to come to a sound arrangement which will also be able to stand the test of criticism at the next WTO negotiations."
"My group is wholly sympathetic to the difficulty in which the Commission finds itself, because no one has yet quite invented the wheel to solve this problem. The Cox report has given an indication, however, of how we might reach a better solution than we have here before is, and I think it is important to follow the Cox report in that respect."
"Mr President, the Commission is basically faced with two different problems. The first of these concerns the fact that we have still not succeeded in developing a definitive VAT system in the EU which really works."
"Such a thing would be extremely beneficial for the development of the internal market and for the EU as a whole."
"Mr Cox has pointed out some of the disadvantages resulting from this oversight."
"Such a situation can lead to paradoxes, for example a third-country supplier is suddenly no longer liable to VAT, while an EU supplier is liable to this particular tax. That is naturally quite unsatisfactory and paradoxical."
"The second problem concerns the technical revolution which has meant that telecommunications services can now be supplied practically irrespective of geographical situation."
"It is therefore now basically possible to offer such services on a planet-wide basis."
"In such circumstances I think that Mr Cox's proposal is intended to gain time."
"This may well be a logical move, but I believe that we should try really hard to find a solution which is based on a definitive VAT policy and on the use of telecommunications services from the point of view of greater local inclusion, since local inclusion is still possible in this area."
"This would be somewhat along the same lines as the Commission's draft directive."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the interest of Mr Cox's report on the system of VAT applicable to telecommunications services lies in the fact that it raises a much wider question which underlies all world doctrine on fiscal law, as the OECD studies prove."
"I myself am supervising the thesis of a young French researcher, Mr Huet, on the issue of international trade and its system of taxation, that is, the whole problem of the risk of cyberevasion, of a taxation of cyberspace yet to be invented, the Internet services, call back, down loading of software, intangible services, and the whole difficulty of the digital influx which cannot be regulated or controlled, and a business which it is said could reach 70 billion dollars by the year 2000."
"We know the questions. Who should enforce this?"
"How should it be enforced?"
"Where should it be enforced?"
"Should we completely exempt it from taxation?"
"Should there be a specific tax?"
"Should there be a world conference, about the whole range of taxes: customs duties, excise duties, corporation tax and VAT?"
"With all the different methods of administering corporation tax that exist?"
"There is the method by which the server should be a stable establishment; for VAT, the distance sales method, or Article 9, first paragraph of the Sixth Directive; or Article 9, paragraph 2, still of the Sixth Directive, which relates to provision of cultural services."
"We know the problem: to avoid distortions in competition."
"In the first system, it is the service provider who defines the place of taxation, to which has to be added the distortion of competition outside or inside of the Community."
"The wish was to combine this with the Commission's system, a relatively coherent one, in which the client defines the place of taxation, before this proposal came about, the March 1997 solution, which has been generalized in all countries - Germany applied it from January 1997, in France we will have a directive on this in May 1997. However a difficulty arises since it confuses the location of the provider with the location of the beneficiary of the provision, depending on whether the person is liable for VAT or not."
"I will therefore, content myself with taking a sample group."
"I am not against the temporary solutions which have been sketched out."
"I wonder - it does no harm just this once - if there should not be a world doctrinal reflection and if, perhaps, the method of complete tax exemption, with all the risks this means for traditional commerce and virtual commerce, or the method of specific taxation are not worth studying."
"I believe that perhaps the solution of a wide conference reflecting on this extremely novel issue may be the right way forward but, in the interim, I recognize that the solutions of a temporary nature drawn up by Mr Cox are acceptable."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the VAT system on telecommunication services, which distorts and weakens competition, is driving European telecommunications companies into a worse position than that in the developing world."
"Under present legislation telecommunication services are taxed where the provider is based."
"This means that telecoms working within the Union pay VAT, and those outside do not."
"The Union VAT jungle is also unequal in its treatment, which also distorts competition."
"Viable internal markets demand viable structures."
"The harmonization of taxation systems is obviously a step in the right direction."
"It is necessary to focus on a taxation and VAT system at the European level, and not just at the national one."
"With the third stage of EMU and the common currency the public finances of all Member States are in any case closely controlled by the Community."
"Why not have the same control for taxation?"
"On the global level, the biggest problem for current European taxation systems is the imposition of taxes on 'fixed' factors, i.e. the workforce."
"For some reason companies that offer employment are pictured as being better off; why otherwise would their tax burden be so unfair compared, for example, to that of automated companies."
"Offering employment is penalized, when it should be rewarded."
"We have to start straightening out the wrinkles in the tax system."
"The minimum requirement is obviously that companies offering employment should at least enjoy equal a status equal to that of automated companies."
"The Council now accepts a system whereby all telecoms in every Member State pay VAT directly to the inland revenue office in their customer's country."
"If the customer happens to be outside the EU, no tax is due at all."
"This defect in the system is a direct invitation for the large telecoms to move to third-world tax havens."
"This we all have a duty to put right."
"Mr President, on 1st January 1998, the liberalization of telecommunications services became a reality in the European Union."
"It is time to complete the regulatory framework which accompanies this liberalization with the VAT discipline."
"In effect, both our telecommunications companies, and the firms of other countries, need to know the fiscal obligations confronting them over the next few years."
"This is the general objective of the proposal."
"Then there are two more specific aims of this directive."
"The first relates to the modification of the territorial of Community VAT and specifies that VAT must always be applicable if a telecommunications service is delivered to a Community client: the consumption in fact takes place in the Community."
"The second specific purpose aims at confirming the existing law of the sixth directive, by which a Community telecommunications operator has fiscal obligations only in the Member State in which it is established."
"To impose registration on it in each Member State in which it has a client, would end up cancelling the greater part of the benefits attaching to liberalization, because the operator would have to keep specific accounts or even have recourse to a fiscal representative in each of these Member States."
"It follows logically from this that we cannot discriminate against operators of third countries by demanding that they register in all the Member States; they too should be able to benefit from the advantage of a single registration in the Community."
"Your rapporteur, Mr Cox, has carefully examined the consequences of this approach and proposes various amendments in his report, adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I can tell you that the Commission has no difficulty in accepting Amendments Nos 1, 3 and 4."
"By contrast, Amendments Nos 5, 6 and 7 are not acceptable, in the opinion of the Commission, because they would postpone the entry into force of the proposed directive until a report has been drawn up on elements which are in reality linked to the present proposal."
"In fact, the progress towards the introduction of a new common VAT system is independent of the creation of a fiscal system for telecommunications services."
"The liberalization of these services will certainly have less impact on the VAT yield than the absence of a VAT system will have on the success of liberalization."
"The effects of the derogations currently applied by the Member States will certainly be taken into account when the negotiations are going on in the Council, but we also know that these systems cannot be extended or generalized, given their disadvantages and imperfections which Mr Cox has also highlighted with great clarity."
"Furthermore, the implications of the application of a single quota to telecommunications remain, at the end of the day, without objective, because I understand that Parliament is not asking for the introduction of such a single share."
"Given that the Commission's approach is not in question and, lacking concrete suggestions for improvement, the Commission considers it particularly inappropriate for the signals put out to the operators to seem to deprive them of the possibility of having, in a short time, a fiscal framework capable of allowing them to benefit fully from the liberalization of telecommunications services, to the profit of our companies and all the consumers."
"Finally, Amendment No 2, which I have not mentioned up to now, is not acceptable because, in fact, it is not correct."
"However, in substance it is taken up in Amendment No 4 which the Commission accepts, as I have already mentioned."
"The Commission was asked, amongst other things, to clarify the reasons why it was not possible to maintain in force the principles provided for in the derogations, the 15 derogations, including them directly in the sixth directive."
"At bottom, the response is already clear in Mr Cox's report."
"There are three disadvantages: the system provided for derogation is not practicable, the control raises concrete problems, and there is also the critical element, raised by some of you, about the contrast between the mechanism of derogation and the structure of the conditions and clauses provided for in the ambit of the GATS."
"Finally I want to observe, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that on the question of ""why are we in such a rush, we have time' in reality there is not very much time, because the derogations end at the end of 1999 and the new system must be adopted, say, before the end of 1998, to allow for incorporation into national legislation."
"So perhaps, there remains between us this divergence of appreciation of the urgency of the matter, on how much time we have available."
"Mr President, in view of the late hour, I do not wish to re-open any of the points of substance in the debate."
"However, I am intrigued by one remark by the Commissioner which gives me pause for thought as to how we should proceed at voting time tomorrow."
"If I understood him correctly he said with regard to exploring a single rate of value added tax for the telecom sector that it may be pointless at the end of the day but that in any event the European Parliament is not asking for it and since there is no proposal the Commission, in a sense, is not taking on the possibility."
"Let me put the direct question: it is a hypothesis, I am the rapporteur and not Parliament, but if Parliament was to come to the Commissioner and say: we want in a proposal not just a revision of the Eighth VAT Directive but we also want a single rate for telecoms, could I take it, as implied in the Commissioner's response, that he would answer in the affirmative?"
"Mr President, in reply to Mr Cox, on rate harmonization it is true that under any tax scheme involving taxation at the place of establishment of the supplier or at the single place of registration within the EU some distortions of competition can occur due to the different level of rates of Member States."
"The Commission would be prepared to suggest the application of a uniform rate for telecommunication services which the current proposal does not provide for and could consider in depth, and probably with a favourable disposition, an indication from the European Parliament pointing in that direction."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.07 p.m.)"
"Madam President, I would like to speak on a point of order."
"The Aftonbladet , a Swedish evening newspaper, of 9 January, had an article on its front page which contained three factual errors, two of which could be verified by Parliament."
"Seventeen Members of this Parliament from six different groups are accused of being involved in Mafia practices, in particular in the drugs Mafia in the European Union."
"Since a system and unit have been set up to act against such scandalous articles, I would like to ask whether the Swedish Information Bureau has produced a fiche d'alerte about this yet, and whether it has arrived at our unit in this Parliament yet, and what this will result in."
"Because it is clearly extremely damaging for this Parliament, and moreover complete nonsense that seventeen members are accused of playing a role in the drugs Mafia, and that they appear in the paper, with pictures and so on."
"I would like to know whether you, or the unit which was set up to deal with these things, will take action against it, and whether a fiche d'alerte has been issued."
"Mrs Van Dijk, to answer the question you have just asked me, I can say that the Bureau did in fact consider, at yesterday evening's meeting, how best to counter this type of accusation or aspersion and that we decided in principle to set up a rapid rebuttal unit, to counter such absolutely inadmissible, unacceptable attacks as effectively as possible."
"And I would like to take this opportunity of informing the whole House of this."
"Madam President, my sincerest apologies for bothering you with a personal problem."
"I tend to start the monthly part-session in Strasbourg in good cheer and in good physical condition, but practically every part-session I end up catching a hefty cold."
"I have noticed that many people have similar problems."
"I think it has to do with the air conditioning system."
"My question is whether you would be willing to ask the relevant services what can be done. Because, Madam President, speaking for myself, by the end of the week it is really unbearable."
"Mr Cornelissen, we cannot start a discussion on this point."
"I am not sorry that you have mentioned the problem."
"I think that you are not the only person to be afflicted, probably because of the air conditioning, at the end of a sitting."
"My answer is that the department responsible will look into the matter, and that we will do everything we can to ensure that a suitable temperature is maintained in this chamber."
"I give you my word, and steps are already being taken, because many Members of this House have already said the same thing."
"Madam President, thank you."
"I think, the explanation, Mr Cornelissen, is much more simple."
"We are pooling the latest viruses and bacteria from the four corners of Europe every month, bringing them here and exchanging them."
"It is our contribution to the single European market and the free circulation of bacteria."
"Thank you, Mr Corbett, for your very amusing contribution to this discussion."
"On the same subject, Madam President, I haven't actually got a cold here in Strasbourg, but if your maintenance engineers are efficient, perhaps you could also send them to Brussels, because I often leave Brussels with a cold."
"We have the same difficulties there... sore eyes... there is a problem."
"Drugs"
"The next item is the report (A4-0359/97) by Mrs d'Ancona, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, containing a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the harmonization of the Member States' laws on drugs."
"Madam President, my problem does not involve my immune system but the agenda."
"You have called for Mrs d'Ancona's report and I should like to request, pursuant to Rule 129 of the Rules of Procedure, that we refer Mrs d'Ancona's report back to committee."
"I should like to justify my request on the following grounds: Our Group, together with Mrs d'Ancona the rapporteur, has held intensive discussions with the other groups in this House."
"We had 36 amendments to discuss, received between the approval of the draft report by the committee and the plenary sitting."
"These 36 amendments, Madam President, include a number of requests which, were they to be accepted, would not simply involve minor changes to the report, but would completely change its stance."
"Over the Christmas break..."
"(Noise) Ladies and gentlemen, there are minimum rules of social courtesy and if you don't known them yet, perhaps you should learn them this morning."
"(Applause) The rapporteur was unable to discuss these amendments with the petitioners in sufficient detail over the Christmas break."
"Mrs d'Ancona and my group therefore request that we be given the opportunity to do this and to endeavour to reach a compromise on this highly sensitive topic of drugs policy."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Schulz, you have made a request pursuant to Rule 129."
"We will therefore apply that rule by the book and I must ask whether there is a speaker in favour this request."
"There is not."
"Against?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this amendment represents quite simply a vote of no confidence in the work of my charming colleague Mrs d'Ancona."
"This fact should not be concealed."
"Obviously you do not have the confidence to open this amendment to discussion or put it to the vote."
"You should also know - despite what my charming colleague Mr Schulz would have us believe - that he is not motivated by improved understanding. Lurking behind this amendment is the long arm of Tony Blair."
"What he has told us here today was actually scripted for him in London."
"It is the work of Tony Blair."
"The British Government has issued a statement which says: But the UK government has made clear that it has no intention of legalizing or decriminalizing any currently controlled drug."
"They can feel their majority wobbling and that's why they want to refer the report back."
"We say that a European drug policy should ask only one question: Does it make access to drugs for young people and children harder or easier?"
"Mrs d'Ancona's policy would make access to drugs for young people and children easier."
"We can say no to that by voting no today."
"And for this reason we reject the petition."
"Mr Nassauer did not exceed his speaking time, nor did Mr Schulz."
"I can assure you that I am extremely vigilant on that point."
"I have already asked someone to speak in favour, in accordance with the Rules."
"No one wanted to do so."
"I can see Mr Dell'Alba."
"Mr Dell'Alba, do you wish to speak in favour?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Nassauer is obviously responsible for his own remarks, even the political remarks he makes."
"I do not want to make any more comments on that subject."
"I will confine myself to saying that in this House, you have to accept responsibility..."
"If you want a report to be rejected by means of a show of force by the majority, I would say to you that is not how it is done in politics."
"When there are sixty amendments in Parliament..."
"(Uproar) Madam President, please ask my Italian friends to be quiet."
"I will speak in whatever language I choose."
"All right?"
"(Applause) All I wanted to say, Mrs Muscardini, is that, when sixty amendments have been tabled, you have to work sensibly, not just make gestures."
"It is therefore in order, in a democratic parliament, for the Committee to whom the matter was been referred, to resume the debate, examine the sixty amendments and present another report to the House."
"We have now heard all the speakers required by the Rules."
"I shall now invite Mrs Green to make a personal statement."
"Madam President, I really cannot resist it."
"Thank you for the invitation to speak and also for recognizing me as Pauline Green."
"I would just like to say that as Mr Nassauer read out one bit of the British Home Office's brief on this, he did of course fail to read out all those bits in it that express sympathy with the report and what it was trying to do and some of the elements that Mrs d'Ancona is trying to cover."
"Mr Schulz, can I presume that Mrs d'Ancona does not wish to speak, as you have expressed her request?"
"I am asking you this because the Rules say that the chairman of the committee, or the rapporteur, may speak."
"So, you have spoken on her behalf."
"That is right, is it not?"
"(Parliament approved the request for referral back to committee)"
"Fingerprinting asylum seekers (Eurodac)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0402/97) by Mrs d'Ancona, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the draft Council Act drawing up the Convention concerning the establishment of 'Eurodac' for the comparison of fingerprints of applicants for asylum and the Convention drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, concerning the establishment of 'Eurodac' for the comparison of fingerprints of applicants for asylum (11079/97 - C4-0506/97-97/0915(CNS))."
"Madam President, the topic I intend to speak on is extremely important although it may not provoke the same emotional response as the other topic we have discussed this morning."
"We can debate this matter in a somewhat more peaceful frame of mind, but I have to tell you honestly that I am discussing it with mixed feelings."
"I will explain why."
"Yesterday evening we had an excellent debate about the refugee policy and about the situation which has arisen out of the fact that 1200 Kurds have asked for political asylum in Italy during the past few weeks."
"Again, it was a good debate which did not split the left and right as the debate on drugs did. From all contributions to the debate it became clear that what we are missing at the moment is a common asylum and migration policy."
"All our colleagues here expressed their disappointment with the fact the Treaty of Amsterdam did not provide for such a common asylum and migration policy."
"Maybe in the long term, but not at the moment."
"We then see that when an incident, such as this situation with the Kurds, concerns us, we do not really know how to respond to it."
"Well, I certainly have mixed feelings. I find it extremely difficult to start talking about instruments which have a sound function within the context of a common asylum policy, but in isolation seem to be there to keep asylum seekers out."
"That is why I thought it was important that we should express an opinion on it."
"Firstly, I find it a sign of excellent goodwill by the Council, and I do not mind repeating this here, that it has decided to involve Parliament in the decision-making process concerning the establishment of this Eurodac instrument."
"In order to do justice to the idea that it is dangerous to make use of specific instruments outside their context, I have introduced a large number of amendments at the request of the Council, and I obviously hope that my colleagues will support these."
"They are based on the belief that we must create the greatest possible security for those in distress, those we are discussing here today: people seeking asylum."
"Specific instruments can be used positively."
"Taking fingerprints to stop people from being sent from one Member State to the other is a case in point, because there might be uncertainty over which country is responsible for their application for asylum."
"This procedure is effective in such cases, and ensures that this situation no longer occurs."
"Secondly, I think that sending people to a third country outside the EU where there are different standards, possibly to the disadvantage of the asylum seeker, is ruled out."
"That is also a good thing."
"In one of the amendments I have also warned that it must be unambiguously clear that the comparison of finger prints should under no circumstance be used for any purpose other than to determine the responsibility of the Member State of origin."
"So it cannot be used for any other purpose than for the one it serves."
"I also think it is important that the register of fingerprints is only kept for a limited amount of time, so that it cannot be misused."
"The other thing I find extremely important is that the European Commission, and not one of the Member States takes on the management of Eurodac."
"I also think there should be a kind of European protector of data, as the number of data bases is increasing, and I think that, in view of people's privacy, we have to treat these with greatest possible care."
"I have suggested that the European Court of Justice should continue to be the appointed institution to turn to as a last resort with complaints in these matters."
"To conclude, Madam President, I have already told you that I think it is a great pity that this procedure is given priority over the total policy."
"It is a pity, but I hope that, once the Council has fine-tuned what is being proposed on a number of points, Eurodac will still be able to fulfil a useful role."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although the report prepared by my colleague Mrs d'Ancona on the drawing up of the Convention concerning the establishment of ""Eurodac' is, in essence, a factual and technical report - as my colleague has already pointed out - the tone is of great significance for those people involved."
"The individuals to be registered using this system have left their home countries for a number of different reasons and by a number of very different routes."
"For the most part they have done so because they were fleeing terror, torture and persecution, but also - and we must not underestimate this - because they come from hopeless social and economic backgrounds."
"They have all chosen flight in the hope that wherever they may one day find refuge, they really will be able to find better and more secure futures, and above all live safer lives."
"However, due to the influx of refugees into the European Union, the receptiveness of Member States has declined rapidly in recent years."
"On one hand, the many common regulations and conventions existing between the Member States create the impression that fortress Europe is expanding. On the other, Europe is becoming more and more unified, internal borders are becoming increasingly less significant and here too there is a need for a common set of regulations."
"This is particularly important in the area of the third pillar."
"However, - and here I must agree with Mrs d'Ancona, and thank her for the excellent work she has done on this report - it is essential that when we talk about an asylum and immigration policy, we talk about a common asylum and immigration policy."
"There should not, therefore, as is currently the case, be a raft of very different regulations applicable in the various Member States which are then brought together into a minimal piece of legislation by the Council, effectively restricting the level of protection for refugees to a minimum."
"I also agree that we should draw up a common framework."
"But there are a couple of additional comments which I would like to make about the report, which I think are important."
"The most important is that data protection be guaranteed for the individuals involved."
"Since it has been laid down that there should be a central organization, but not exactly how this organization should function, it is also important that we agree, as Mrs d'Ancona has stated, that this central unit be based within the European Commission."
"I also think it is important that the Member States have only limited access to this central unit, and for a period of only three months, as they are also able to set up their own registers."
"Therefore, in my view, it is necessary that access by the Member States to this central register be limited."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the core of this automatic data processing system relates to the fact that, in principle, future applicants for asylum in the European Union should be fingerprinted as soon as they enter a Member State, as long as they are at least 14 years old."
"I should like to make it clear from the outset that, for reasons I shall go into later, the PPE Group supports this intention, and that we cannot therefore see the point in linking it to the criticism that, as in other circumstances finger-printing is used as a method of the criminal justice system, it would effectively criminalize applicants for asylum."
"In this regard, there are certain technical requirements which I should like to outline briefly."
"It is important that asylum proceedings in Europe are decided quickly."
"This is the right of applicants for asylum, irrespective of whether or not their applications are founded or whether or not they are victims of political persecution."
"Whatever the case, they need to know as soon as possible whether they can remain in Europe."
"Secondly, jurisdictions must be clearly defined."
"It must be clear which Member State is responsible for dealing with an asylum procedure, i.e. who examines the application."
"Thirdly, we must avoid a situation in which applicants for asylum are shunted back and forth between EU Member States."
"These are the prerequisites of proper, constitutional and humane proceedings and in order to achieve them it is necessary to establish the identity of applicants for asylum, and where appropriate their family members, and that is what this system is for."
"This is, of course, subject to data protection legislation. The relevant agreement states that the Council of Europe Convention on Data Protection of 1981 is applicable in all cases."
"This convention specifies, inter alia , that such finger prints must be deleted if, for example, the applicant receives citizenship of a Member State or is recognised in a Member State as a refugee."
"However, not all those seeking asylum are the victims of political persecution."
"Yesterday the figures relating to applicants for asylum in Germany last year were published."
"They numbered more than 104 000, and of these, just over 5 % received recognition as political refugees."
"Of course, there are a considerable number of asylum seekers who make not one, but two or more applications in order to receive several lots of social security benefit."
"This is a regrettable fact which should not be overlooked."
"In Germany, for example, investigations were carried out covering the period from January 1993 to September 1996 and no less than 46 000 cases of fraud were detected - a rate of approximately 1 in 10."
"Since the introduction of an automated finger-printing system in Germany this figure has dropped considerably."
"A comparative study has also been carried out examining asylum application procedures in Switzerland and Germany."
"It revealed that double applications giving rise to payment of double social security benefits were received from the main applicant countries - Turkey 12 %, Pakistan 19 %, Zaire 12 %, Lebanon 12 % - and this fact cannot simply be ignored."
"Similar figures also came out of a study comparing Switzerland and Austria."
"Therefore, it makes sense to have such a procedure."
"It benefits those who are genuinely the victims of political persecution and for this reason the PPE Group supports this Council Convention and has some reservations about the restrictions contained in Mrs d'Ancona's report."
"Madam President, today we are considering the report from Mrs d'Ancona on the proposal from the Council for an automated system for recognizing the fingerprints of asylum seekers."
"We agree with the rapporteur that we need to improve citizens' legal position, through clear measures and quick procedures, in recognizing the right to asylum."
"Moreover, we support the desire to establish a European data protection system, particularly given the growing number of systems which facilitate the exchange of personal data and the difficulty in defending these systems against possible abuse of the individuals they include."
"Asylum is a basic human right."
"To grant or deny access to the asylum process may mean the difference between a person's life and death, as is pointed out in the report."
"This feature must be there in every instance, and the necessary precautions have to be taken so that the people affected can benefit from the most favourable legal conditions."
"In this context I would like to recall the passivity demonstrated by the Spanish Government in the face of asylum and refugee applications from more than 270 Algerian immigrants who are still waiting in Melilla - and have been in some cases for more than two years - for their applications for legal protection to be dealt with in the face of the terrorist threat to which they are subject in their country of origin."
"Meanwhile, the Spanish authorities maintain - incomprehensibly - that Algeria is not an area of conflict."
"The coordination of asylum policies needed in the European Union must not be allowed to erode the system of international protection."
"In this sense, the future political union will have to maintain and develop the traditional European policy of the right to asylum."
"We advocate a progressive attitude with respect to the right to asylum, subject to all the international conventions, and through a progressive application of that right to nationals from countries within the Union."
"However, when political union is fully achieved this right will only be necessary in terms of nationals from third countries."
"Madam President, all over Europe at the moment people are thinking back to the words Emile Zola threw at his government exactly 100 years ago: J'accuse - I accuse."
"It was the expression of his despairing resistance against a despotic power which had branded an innocent man guilty in a calculated political manoeuvre, flouted the dictates of justice, ignored the dignity of man and sacrificed him to the opinion of an enraged public."
"One hundred years later we are safe in the knowledge that we have finally tamed this kind of power, finally subjected it to justice."
"Yet still we are forced to watch just such an accusation levelled against just such despotism reforming in the hearts and minds of thousands of men and women at the borders of Europe who are being prevented from enjoying their human right to asylum with ever new forms of harassment, with denial and perversion of the course of justice."
"We are forced to watch how justice and politics retreat in the face of a hysterical public and the mass phenomenon of xenophobia."
"No other region in the world has triggered more or larger streams of refugees than did this continent in the 20th century."
"Millions of men and women from Europe have been received into countless countries all over the world, very often countries themselves suffering ruin and poverty."
"Today, at the time of our greatest historical prosperity, an incomparably smaller number of oppressed and persecuted individuals is taking flight in our direction. And what are we doing?"
"We are refusing an ever growing number of them the right to shelter."
"Instead, we are using police methods to monitor them."
"European co-operation sees its only duty as being their rejection and, if necessary, their deportation."
"In the face of a mere 2000 fleeing Kurds politicians conjure horrific images of an uncontrolled flood of refugees."
"Phrases such as ""illegal immigrants' are used."
"Europe, which owes its cultural wealth to its openness to the world, is becoming a fortress."
"If that ""j'accuse' forms in the minds and hearts of the men and women waiting at the walls of this fortress, then it is we who are accused."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, recent events have forcibly and tragically reminded us of the importance of the asylum policy to every Member State of the European Union and to the European Union as a whole."
"Although it is obvious that inter-state cooperation is not only useful but also necessary in this area, it is nevertheless true that the problem of accepting refugees, and the right of asylum, are essentially, a question of national sovereignty, as moreover, the French Constitutional Council recently ruled."
"These principles are reflected in the 'Eurodac' report, which is above all a technical report, but also a political report."
"The rapporteur suggests that responsibility for the management of the Eurodac system should be entrusted, not to a Member State, under the responsibility of the Council, but to the Commission."
"It seems to us that it would be preferable for the management of such a system to remain under the responsibility of the Council instead of being entrusted to the Commission."
"Indeed, the Council, emanating from the Member States, has a more accurate perception of the real, practical issues associated with the problems of accepting refugees, whereas the Commission is likely to have a more 'disembodied' view, more remote from practical problems and real life in each of the Member States faced with an influx of refugees."
"That is why we will vote against the Committee on Civil Liberties' amendments."
"The refugee problem is an extremely serious human problem, but politics is the art of reality."
"A few years ago, our colleague, Michel Rocard said that France could not accommodate all the poverty of the world."
"I do not think that Europe can accommodate all the poverty of the world either, and it is a question, as far as we are concerned, of being able to organize cooperation and development policies for poor countries, to enable their inhabitants to prosper at home."
"Madam President, the Kurdish refugee case is a current reminder that the problem of the asylum seeker is perhaps one of if not the greatest challenges for Europe in the coming years."
"I should add, however, that the Kurdish problem is still very small in comparison to the tidal wave of millions which threatens to come our way if the situation in Algeria escalates any further."
"But I am already wondering which European government will have the courage to call a halt to this tidal wave of millions, which, with all respect, would render today's debate on the registration of fingerprints totally obsolete."
"We obviously support the Council's Eurodac proposal for a central fingerprints register for asylum seekers."
"In my opinion it is one of very few interventions which might alleviate to a small extent, not enough, but to a small event the negative effects of the loss of border controls in the Schengen countries, which, for that matter, we continue to challenge."
"We reject the amendments of the d'Ancona report equally obviously, amendments which on the one hand serve to hamper the much-needed fingerprints register, and on the other hand give the European Commission a decision-making position in asylum policy which the Commission is absolutely not entitled to."
"Lastly, it is also my duty to broaden the debate a little, and to remind you that experience teaches us that, after investigation, more than 90 % of applications for asylum turn out to be completely unfounded."
"This should be said now that so many politicians in my country and outside continue to argue for a kind of Santa Claus politics which is ultimately pursued on the back and at the expense of the less well-off and the poorest amongst our own people."
"So to conclude, I repeat that in my view genuine political refugees should be received in countries neighbouring their countries of origin which have on the whole a similar way of life and culture, and therefore not in Europe, and that we are prepared to support this policy materially."
"Secondly, we believe that illegal asylum seekers, in other words 90 % of applicants, should be categorically deported, yet in a humane manner."
"Only then will renewed support be found in Europe to help all genuine refugees."
"Today, sadly enough, yet for understandable reasons, this is certainly not the case."
"Madam President, this Eurodac Convention is essential in order to get the Dublin Convention to work."
"It is necessary for us in Europe to cooperate on questions of asylum seekers."
"The current, tragic situation of the Kurdish refugees is an example."
"It is necessary to have an effective and responsible asylum policy in the EU."
"The issue is not who should have a right to asylum in the EU."
"Rather the issue concerns a better sharing of the responsibility for refugees in Europe."
"It is simply a matter of getting better tools to decide which Member State is responsible for dealing with an application for asylum which is submitted within the EU."
"On the one hand we should avoid turning asylum seekers into political footballs between different countries because no-one wants to take responsibility for dealing with their case."
"There are many tragic examples of cases where asylum seekers wait for years to get their applications processed, or are sent back and forth between different European countries because no-one wants to accept responsibility."
"That is not the way for us to treat people who in many cases have escaped from oppression and torture."
"On the other hand, we should prevent too much cheating."
"It is important that every country is obliged to take fingerprints."
"That is the only way that we can prevent asylum seekers changing identity after being turned down by one Member State."
"If we have a database of fingerprints, we can uncover cheating and abuse immediately."
"This would also be beneficial for genuine asylum seekers."
"I am very pleased that the rapporteur emphasizes the fact that the setting up of this database must not mean that the asylum seekers' legal protection is compromised."
"Asylum seekers have a right to data protection."
"There should be security and control of the data, both in terms of who has access to it and who is able to use it."
"Mr President, the recent upsurge of refugees arriving in Europe has had the merit of drawing attention to the problems of asylum seekers in the European Union."
"The Eurodac system presented by the Commission is a response to one aspect of the problem."
"The Dublin Convention did say that a refugee must apply for asylum in the first host country and comply with that country's decision, which would apply to the whole EU."
"The Eurodac system is now trying to transpose that principle into reality, in order to ensure that certain people, without identification, do not travel from country to country, according to the welfare benefits they can obtain, whilst awaiting a decision."
"Fingerprinting would make it possible for find out quickly, without having to wait a long time, whether the person in question applied for asylum in the first host country."
"The main advantage of this system is its rapidity, which will therefore be of benefit to real refugees, who apply for asylum within the law, and will prevent others from taking unfair advantage of the hospitality of the Member States."
"Eurodac is not a tool to be used for repression, to drive out refugees."
"As was said yesterday evening, Europe must not be closed to refugees; it must remain open to people in distress."
"Eurodac should, on the contrary, help contribute towards our ability to provide hospitality, whilst preventing abuse of the system."
"The system is very often abused - as recent events have shown - by extremely well organised and well-informed criminals, who, for enormous sums of money, transport people in distress, and provide them with information about the loop-holes and weaknesses in the laws of EU countries."
"Those who cry shame as soon as the word 'repression' is mentioned, disregard the fact that, to Mafias of all types, illegal border crossings are the most lucrative form of criminal activity after drug dealing."
"During the debates on the Kurdish refugees, the need for European harmonization, with regard to asylum policy, suddenly became apparent."
"Eurodac is one element of European cooperation, a tool to help us handle the arrival of refugees."
"Although the Eurodac system must be welcomed as a technical instrument to prevent abuse, we should not lose sight of the root of the problem, that is, the situation in refugees' home countries."
"It is here that European internal and foreign affairs policies should meet in order to form an overall, and therefore more effective approach."
"The European Union must incorporate human rights considerations more fully into its relationship with such countries, support the reconciliation of people within the framework of the rule of law, and denounce the political, economic and cultural oppression of minorities."
"The European Union is one of the largest distributors of economic aid throughout the world."
"May we at the same time gain a reputation for our protection of democratic values!"
"Mr President, Eurodac is part of a restrictive and to some extent brutalizing refugee policy which we can see developing in Western Europe today."
"The countries of the EU are closing themselves more and more to large parts of the surrounding world."
"Far too often refugees are treated in a shameful manner, as if they were criminals rather than people seeking protection."
"The basis of Eurodac is that an application for asylum should only be dealt with in one Member State."
"I do not share this basic view and therefore support paragraph 8 of the report, which I believe is absolutely crucial."
"Every asylum seeker should be dealt with separately, regardless of whether they are included on such a database or not."
"That is a fundamental point."
"There are innumerable examples of asylum seekers who have been rejected by one EU country, but have later been able to seek asylum in another country and have had their applications accepted."
"I myself have several personal friends who have managed to do that."
"One wonders what is going to happen to them when this system begins to work in practice."
"Taking fingerprints is an infringement of personal integrity."
"An obligatory system of fingerprinting is ultimately based on the idea that people who do not want to give their fingerprints should be forced to do so, by violence in extreme cases."
"This applies to children from the age of 14 upwards."
"That is a serious infringement of personal integrity."
"I believe this is not really necessary."
"In Sweden we used to have a system which meant that only those who could not prove their identity in a reliable way were required to provide fingerprints."
"That is a method which is entirely sufficient to clarify who the asylum seeker is."
"In practice the asylum seekers cannot say no, because it would damage their case if they refused to provide fingerprints."
"The draft convention also contains several other weaknesses."
"I think the age limit of 14 has been set too low. It should be at least 18 or 21 years, or another age when a person may be regarded as an adult."
"The requirement that data should be erased from the system is incomplete."
"There are clear risks that people are going to be registered who are resident quite legally in various Member States."
"We know that there are British and German reservations about the proposal which was discussed at the Ministers' meeting in December."
"In that it is made clear that people who have a residence permit in a Member State should not be included on the database."
"I believe it is a quite natural demand that has been made in connection with these negotiations, it is a demand for legal certainty."
"It is also unclear, in spite of what is in the draft convention, what opportunities the asylum seekers actually have to get information, to be able to appeal and to assert their rights."
"There is a similar system of control for the database in the Schengen Information System called JSA, Joint Supervisory Authority ."
"At the moment that operates alarmingly badly."
"We know that the supervision is poor, the legal certainty is weak and the opportunities to appeal are small."
"I believe there is an obvious risk that there will be the same weaknesses in the Eurodac system which exist in the Schengen system today."
"It is a system which means that in practice the refugee is always at a disadvantage."
"With these words I want to show that I share much of the rapporteur's criticism."
"She points out serious defects in the existing system."
"I do not share her view that the Commission should have influence over this."
"It is an intergovernmental issue and an issue for the Member States."
"In spite of this criticism, I am going to vote for Mrs d'Ancona's report because it raises important issues about the Eurodac system."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to say to Mr Buffetaut who spoke earlier, that he did not quote Michel Rocard in full."
"I would like to finish the quotation."
"Michel Rocard did indeed say that France could not welcome all the poverty in the world, but he added that France should accept its full share."
"I think that is important."
"When we discuss the Eurodac report, we are right in the middle of the problems caused by non-harmonization of our immigration and asylum policies."
"Yesterday, we had a debate on the arrival of Kurdish refugees in Italy, and we saw how difficult it is to discuss problems in the heat of the moment."
"Although it was rightly emphasized that the Italian government's attitude is perfectly respectable, we also had to recognise that on the whole, the behaviour of EU countries is undecided and questionable, as we have failed to establish any prior agreement, upstream, on measures to be adopted in this type of situation."
"The Eurodac project is part of the pursuit of harmonization of asylum practices."
"I therefore agree with it in principle, provided of course that we are very watchful with regard to human rights, as Mrs d'Ancona said."
"Her report makes provision for this and I support it."
"But I should like above all to emphasize the need to progress rapidly towards the harmonization of asylum practices."
"Madam Commissioner, you have made a proposal with regard to the temporary protection of displaced persons, which I have already had occasion to applaud."
"But as you know, when the Council finally adopts that initiative, it will solve only part of the problem."
"Because what have we seen with regard to applications for asylum in the EU for several years?"
"The number of requests for asylum peaked in 1992, and has since decreased every year."
"National provisions have been adopted by many Member States to discourage people wanting to seek a better future in Europe, who are unable to enter Europe because of stricter immigration controls, from trying to obtain the status of refugee."
"Such new provisions largely explain the decrease in asylum seekers."
"But it therefore seems obvious that there should now be a higher rate of acceptance of applications."
"But Mr President, Madam Commissioner, what we see taking place is exactly the opposite, the rate of acceptance is also decreasing."
"Has the world suddenly become a haven of peace and prosperity?"
"Every day brings us new proof that it has not."
"There is a simpler reason, that can be seen, the increasing timidity of Member States and the more and more repressive policies being set up."
"The laws of some Member States interpret the Geneva Convention in a spirit contrary to its promoters."
"People who are really persecuted are refused the status of refugee, on the grounds that their persecutors are not Government agents, and the Council ratified this restrictive interpretation in a resolution of March 1996."
"As of course the risks such people run if they return are well known, they are tolerated within the EU, but without status or rights, in several of our Member States."
"Some have already created a complementary protection status, others like my own, are working on it."
"Madam Commissioner, would it not be preferable to have a common policy on this point, and to work towards the definition of a status of subsidiary protection at the European Union level?"
"Mr President, it is the goal of the European Union to devise an asylum policy which helps the real refugees, that is those who are entitled to refugee status under the Geneva Convention, and, secondly, to prevent abuse of the right of asylum."
"Amsterdam set the course for a route to a common asylum policy."
"The Dublin Convention which is currently in force is a first, quite crucial step towards the development of a common asylum policy."
"The tool we are now discussing, the Eurodac system, is a tool which ensures that those who need help actually get it and prevents those who are abusing the right of asylum from doing so."
"So it is a good tool."
"The proposal put to us by the Council is a tool which is acceptable and which helps to achieve the European Union's goals in terms of asylum policy."
"What the committee with its restrictions and tendentious conclusions has made of it, on the other hand, does not help us achieve the goals we have set ourselves."
"When you consider that if an application is re-presented, although it has been rejected by only one State, the same applicant and all his or her arguments have to be heard again in all the other Member States, this represents a huge amount of time and money."
"Our systems are overloaded and at the end of the day we are unable to offer help or guarantee asylum."
"As my second point, I should like to note here that, due to a proposal from the committee, it is not possible to compare fingerprints with those of applicants who have made applications in their own countries, even though this would show us that only a small proportion of the applicants are actually suitable candidates for asylum."
"These are single figure percentages in each of the countries, which, in fact, means that very many applications are made without grounds."
"I know of cases in which up to ten applications for asylum have been made in different states and yet people still say that the right of asylum in Europe is not abused."
"We have to do something about it."
"We need to ensure that, in general, those who support the fingerprinting of applicants for asylum are not looked at disapprovingly; otherwise, we would be giving the wrong signals and going down the wrong path."
"We need the Eurodac System because it supports a good and proper asylum policy and is designed to stop abuse."
"So we will support Eurodac in the form that has been proposed by the Council."
"However, I - and this also applies to the European People's Party Group - cannot endorse the proposals coming from the committee."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the opportunity which the Eurodac System will afford us in terms of fighting the current abuse of the asylum application system, for a great number of reasons, must be welcomed."
"If it should be possible, through the use of fingerprinting systems and the storage of fingerprints to prevent multiple applications, irrespective of the reasons for which they are: on social, economic or family grounds, because people do not want to stay in one place and decide to make an application somewhere else, that is OK."
"But time and time again we restrict these debates which we are having on the right of asylum here today to technical debates."
"We did it yesterday, and we are doing it again this morning."
"Let us ask ourselves the question once and for all: Why is it that we are obliged to talk about a Eurodac system at all?"
"Why, as soon as the discussion turns to asylum, do we always concentrate on abuses of the right of asylum in a criminal context?"
"Mr Pirker, for eleven years I have been the Mayor of a German town which lies on the Dutch and Belgian borders."
"The town of which I am Mayor has the highest percentage of refugees from the Bosnian civil war."
"Most of them came to my town from Srebrenica und Gorazde. We took them in and then we had to beg them to declare themselves asylum seekers because Germany does not recognise a right of asylum for refugees from civil wars."
"In Germany there is no legal basis for refugees from civil war."
"I have begged these people to claim asylum, though they say they are not victims of political persecution, but are fleeing from a civil war and want to return to their country when the civil war is over."
"Which is just what they have been doing since the Dayton Agreement!"
"I was forced to ask them to consider themselves as asylum seekers, which meant that they were forced to stay in my town."
"If they had gone anywhere else, which would have made me for one very happy since it would have meant a little respite for my finances, someone like Mr Pirker would have come along and said: Just a minute, Eurodac, fingerprinting system for asylum seekers, you can't go there!"
"With this small example, I am trying to illustrate the fact that the European Union's refugee policy needs to be a combination of various different areas of policy."
"For time and time again we face a situation in which people say: I want to emigrate to the European Union."
"It is possible, in theory."
"It might not be advisable because of the great defensive front, but if someone wants to emigrate he is allowed to in principle and so we need to create an appropriate new legal base."
"We do not have one."
"There is no European immigration law, there are no national immigration laws."
"We force people who want to migrate here to assume the status of an asylum seeker."
"That is the danger we ourselves are creating for the right of asylum!"
"In the European Union we always adopt the same approach: we deny the fact that Europe is a continent which attracts immigrants, even though it is due to the poverty gap for which we are in part responsible, in particular the difference in poverty levels between the north and the south as well as between the west and the east, along with the lack of willingness on the part of some EU Member States to share their wealth."
"This will be shown very clearly in the remainder of the debate."
"Naturally, our wealth has a magnetic effect on the poorer regions which surround us."
"The answer to the problem cannot be defence, it must lie in control, and particularly in three interlinking areas of the law: immigration quotas, clear rules for the acceptance of refugees from civil wars needing temporary protection and, finally, the core of political persecution which is then no longer a problem."
"And even then you don't need Eurodac!"
"If you think that you can solve the problem at the inter-state level, colleagues in the PPE, let me tell you today: Forget it!"
"You have created the European Economic Area, you have created a de facto EU state, but now you want to continue the process, focusing on specifics, dissected for want of long-needed progress in terms of harmonization."
"If we do not remove this disfunctionality, Europe will fail its own citizens as a result of this imbalance."
"You should be a little more harmonization-friendly in matters of integration, not just in matters of defence."
"Mr President, let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs d'Ancona, on a good and thorough report on the Eurodac Convention."
"I also welcome the quick reading which the matter has received here in Parliament."
"When we discuss the Eurodac Convention, we must do so in the light of the Dublin Convention, because that is where we find the criteria for which Member State is responsible for the examination of an application for asylum."
"That is also where to find the rules on how an asylum seeker may be returned to the country which is to decide the application for asylum."
"The Dublin Convention was signed in June 1990."
"Seven years later, in September last year, it entered into force."
"However, it is not enough to have a legal system for the first asylum principle and for it to be able to work."
"That is why the Dublin Convention refers to Article 15, paragraph 12, and the fact that we need computerization of information about the identity of asylum seekers."
"It is in that context that Eurodac comes in as a complement."
"It is, after all, as a complement to the Dublin Convention that Eurodac should be seen."
"Through Eurodac it will be possible to find out whether asylum applications are being made in several places by one and the same person."
"It is important for us to know that if the Dublin Convention is to function effectively at all."
"That is in turn only possible through a computerized system for fingerprints, which is found in the Eurodac Convention."
"We are working within an institutional framework which is in a state of change."
"The draft Eurodac Convention we are debating here today has been drawn up under the rules of the Maastricht Treaty."
"The Commission is aware that the Amsterdam Treaty means another institutional framework, but we do not think that we can wait until this new Treaty enters into force. We need the Eurodac system now if the Dublin Convention is to be able to be credible and effective."
"Like Mr Nassauer, I think it is important that we have a quick procedure and that people are informed very quickly about the situation they are in."
"I also think this is demonstrated by recent events in Italy, i.e. that we need a different system to the one we have today."
"At the same time I would like to emphasize that if the Eurodac Convention is not in force when the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified, the Commission will of course come back and propose a Community instrument."
"The Commission shares Parliament's view that the Convention should be entirely in agreement with the rules on data protection, which I think it is in its current form."
"During the discussion on the proposal the Commission urged that the principles of data protection should be in agreement with the Community's rules in this area, even though the Regulation on Data Protection is not applicable in the third pillar area."
"I think that we have now reached an acceptable level of data protection."
"We should therefore support the compromise on Article 6 which requires that after a five year period the Council of Ministers should consider whether it is still necessary to keep data on people who are granted refugee status."
"The Commission also welcomes a number of the amendments which have been proposed."
"That includes in particular Amendments Nos 1, 11, 16, 19, 20, 27, 29, 30 and 34 which we are now considering."
"Amendment No 20 includes parts which we can accept, particularly the principle on decisions with regard to implementation measures and that they should be carried by majority decision."
"Finally, I would like to underline the fact that Eurodac's operation is going to be entirely dependent on how we manage the financing, both with regard to setting up the system and the operation itself."
"It is my hope that the principle of Community financing will be adopted and that is also what the Commission supports."
"If that is the case, the European Parliament will have a decisive role to play in how the future Eurodac shall operate."
"The Commission looks forward to being able to deal with the question of Eurodac's financing together with the European Parliament."
"Thank you, Commissioner Gradin."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.00 noon."
"Green Paper on the statutory auditor"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez (A4-0373/97), on the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the Green Paper on the role, the position and the liability of the statutory auditor within the European Union (COM(96)0338 - C4-0451/96)."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, a series of recent financial collapses, which have had serious consequences for investors, have brought to the fore the question of liability in financial accounts as well as the role played by the auditor."
"The question deserves particular attention for two reasons: firstly, since the auditor has become responsible for the accuracy of financial statements; and secondly, since there is no uniform legislative framework within the European Union relating to the role, the position and the liability of the statutory auditor, to respond to society's demand for better and more transparent information concerning companies' accounts."
"With the appearance of new company and business models, as well as new financial products, the auditor's report has taken on not only an extremely important role but also acquired features relating to its independence and professional nature."
"In the Green Paper the lack of a common position or joint action within the European Union has been assessed as a negative factor."
"In regard to the statutory auditor's role, there is no specific Community directive regulating all its legal aspects."
"Such a need is catered for only through reference to prejudiced questions contained in various different directives. In addition to this, the basic national legislation of Member States, where regulations are normally not specific, is normally used when considering this diverse and varied situation."
"From the plans drawn up for both the single market and the single currency it would seem appropriate to move towards common action."
"However, the Commission expresses doubts in the Green Paper in regard to the fund and as to how the appropriate legal means will shape any joint action."
"Sometimes the need to establish minimum principles is referred to, while at other times the possibility of making a single recommendation to the Member States is mentioned."
"Given this situation we must call on the Commission to set out its objectives in the short and medium term, for the creation and operation of an internal market for auditing, as well as a timetable and the measures which must be adopted or rejected."
"In any case, the need to press ahead with legislative action to harmonize the minimum content of audit reports cannot be delayed."
"The Green Paper seems to tend towards establishing a common concept of auditing or establishing a set of objectives to be followed by this entire sector throughout the European Union, and which can then be used to define the obligations or legal requirements which the auditor will have to fulfil in carrying out his role."
"The problematic nature of this issue comes from the fact that, although it is recognized throughout the Member States that auditing should have a common objective, namely to guarantee that the accounts, financial statements and assets published offer an exact and fair picture of a company's situation, the legislation, customs and practices of Member States vary considerably, and this affects the efficiency of the audit trail."
"There again, I should point out that the accuracy of reports is dependent on the truthfulness of the information the auditor receives."
"The Commission's idea to present a draft recommendation to improve the management of companies in Member States is, in this sense, very relevant."
"Finally I would like to voice a complaint that we have not had access to the study which the Commission has begun on the impact of different national legislations in the matter of civil liability. Nor have we had access to the provisional conclusions of the conference held in December 1996 to discuss the Green Paper."
"It is clear that Parliament will not be able to decide on this issue without full knowledge of the facts. Of course, in every country in the European Union, the auditor is potentially subject to both criminal and civil liability and to professional sanctions."
"However, the kinds of liability and time periods allowed vary from one country to another. Therefore, while adequate legal recourse is not available, it seems that to protect users - in the widest sense of the term - we have to study the possibility of every auditor having minimum obligatory insurance equivalent in every Member State or making it compulsory to be affiliated to a guarantee fund."
"To conclude, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the technical subcommittee - within the planned contact committee on accountancy directives - must involve representation for a wide range of people who use the audit reports, because the outcome of accounting reports is not only the responsibility of professional auditors."
"Mr President, this is an important report on the Commission's Green Paper on the statutory audit, and I wish to thank Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez for the completeness and thoroughness of her report."
"This is an important subject: it ensures the solvency and financial probity of companies and it is especially important in view of the limited liability of companies."
"It must be in the interests of the consumer, the investor and the company itself that reliance can be placed on the company's accounts."
"The report deals with five main themes, in my view: the role of the auditor itself, the liability of auditors, the qualifications of auditors and professional regulation, the mobility of auditors in the European Union, and the need for universal standards for the statutory audit."
"I particularly agree with the rapporteur's recommendations in paragraph 11 that auditors should have a minimum level of compulsory insurance and be required to join a guarantee fund."
"My group will be supporting the report and, in particular, the amendment by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, which adds to the clarity and certainty of paragraph 7."
"I wish to highlight one particular concern: it is believed that Article 51 of the Fourth Company Law Directive has not been properly implemented in Italian law."
"It is estimated that 100 000 companies are not receiving a statutory audit in Italy, which puts in danger the reliance which can be placed on the accounts of these particular companies."
"It would be helpful if the Commission could address this question, and I understand the Commission has already sent Italy a reasoned opinion in respect of the Eighth Company Law Directive relating to the professional qualifications of auditors."
"In conclusion, this may appear to be a dry subject but is in fact of great importance for the proper functioning of the economy in the European Union; it is a measure of protection for consumers and investors and should be supported for those very reasons."
"Madam Commissioner, it is difficult to add anything else to what the previous speakers have said in regard to the importance of the statutory audit."
"It is difficult because, in an ever more complex society, you will frequently find different interpretations as to the legal parameters of the companies being expressed."
"And I am only going to quote two examples, which the rapporteur has pointed out with the accuracy which has characterized all her work. Two of the examples she has mentioned, financial engineering - the socalled financial engineering - or the qualification of credits can spoil the given picture, which is a true and real picture, the one set down in the company's accounts."
"Such ambiguity, of course, makes it necessary to look back to the security of mercantile traffic, for society as a whole, between the services of these professionals which, to give them their due, have to respond to the features of independence, free competition, responsibility and clear rules which have been mentioned."
"But these are concerns which worry everybody - states, companies, consumers alike."
"Perhaps we should also mention that there has been competition since the treaties, that is to say competition to shape the internal market."
"Firstly that competition is exclusive; we are not dealing with areas of shared competition where the principle of subsidiarity acts as an authoritative principle for that competition."
"Here competition belongs to the European Institutions."
"That should be made perfectly clear."
"It has been pointed out, but it must be emphasized."
"Secondly, without doubt, this has to be set against the question of how far is it necessary to take action. However much competition is exclusive, no-one considers it appropriate to act more than is strictly necessary to achieve the objectives of harmonization and consolidation of the internal market which the Treaties specify."
"For that reason, if spontaneous harmonization of these rules could be produced, which have been shown, day after day, to be completely different in the Member States, this task of setting rules and regulations - that is community competition - would not need to be carried out."
"In this case, as in so many others, the best authority is the one which does not have to take action but may initiate the action process."
"In this sense I wish to emphasize that the sectors concerned are carrying out an important consultation programme, within the Member States, in order to attain such spontaneous harmonization."
"So as it is, we have community competition which must be put into practice."
"Indeed it has been put into practice."
"Not only the Fourth Directive for accountancy, which has been mentioned, but the Seventh Directive too and the Bank sector and Insurance directives refer to the function of the statutory audit."
"And it is certain, as has also been said, that in some cases - specifically in Article 51 of the Fourth Directive relating to annual accounts - it is not administered very well, but today we are discussing about another question: about lege ferenda , for which we must establish norms."
"Certainly, the matter of excessive concentration in large auditing companies is a process in which we are immersed. No longer do we have the big six, but now even less than that and recently we have often had occasion to listen to or read such news in the media - which does not affect the Green Paper; they are questions concerning the Department of Competition in the Commission and, certainly too, it is the Commission's task to monitor the strict application of the Treaties."
"Here we are talking about something else."
"We are talking about what must be done, about how to establish standards in order to reach such an internal market, to establish coherent and harmonized rules in the different Member States. Mrs Sierra's report, which takes up the idea from the Committee, is one that the Group of the European People's Party - on whose behalf I am speaking - is going to support with the qualification that it puts forward in the amendment set down in paragraph 7, about which I will now speak."
"Likewise the idea from the technical committee becomes clear - as has already been mentioned - and, finally, we need to set clear limits on what are parallel services, which in a straightforward, trading and entrepreneurial expansion auditing companies tend to deliver."
"This need to be independent, this need to portray an unbiased view, and to show that they are absolutely unconnected with the company that they are auditing, ensures that they have to guarantee not to prejudge any solutions; this is the point of the PPE amendment . However, the Commission needs to address the problem of how to establish or guarantee such independence, particularly in relation to legal services since, the legal adviser is an independent professional but one who is partisan, who is within the company, who has his own interests."
"His role has to be well and clearly separated from the role of the auditor who, and I finish with this, if he is to be anything, must be totally independent."
"Mr President, let me start by thanking the rapporteur for her careful and extremely in-depth report."
"The previous speaker said that a over-concentration of accountancy firms is taking place."
"The rapporteur says the two things are unrelated, but they are definitely related."
"Just as the large financial conglomerates, the banks and the insurance companies, have now merged, we are also seeing that in the service industries all kinds of professional groups are now amalgamating; lawyers, notaries, tax specialists, and consultants."
"Now it appears that the accountant, previously the prototype of a dry, upright figure working on his own who would only get a look in to see that figures entered in the books were correct, has now become someone who also intervenes in what happens in companies. Herein lies the responsibility of the Commission given the fact that there is no harmonized European fiscal legislation."
"How can we tackle this?"
"It appears that these international mergers between large accountancy firms and consultants are indeed due to this fact, and that the Commission neglected once again to achieve fiscal harmonization, which plays an important role while the Member States did not get involved because they did not want to. However, the Commission is in favour of it."
"This also means that the professional risks accountants run at the moment differ widely."
"Because they vary between billions in the case of the BCCI to a legally limited risk of DM 500 000 in the Federal Republic."
"This is such a big difference, Mr President, that something simply must be done about it."
"We do not want accumulation."
"That is why we submitted our amendment to paragraph 7."
"I think the amendment by Mrs Palacio goes just a little too far; it leaves too much room for manoeuvre."
"It is crucial for the consumer and for small companies, that in addition to pure control, a mild form of consultation is allowed to continue."
"We would like to retain this for the benefit of the consumer."
"Mr President, Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez has tackled a variety of complex issues in her report."
"However, in commenting on the Commission's Green Paper I believe it is our task to pose questions and to point directions rather than to deal with it as if it were legislation."
"There are micro and macro sides to the problems."
"The micro aspect covers minimum standards for the auditing exercise."
"Financial reports of any enterprises, including trusts and charities, should be subject to similar rules right across the Community, and there should be mutual recognition of the qualifications of those empowered to sign audit reports."
"The Commission has not been very successful in bringing about the implementation of all the directives which have already been placed on the statute book."
"Article 51 of the Fourth Directive has been mentioned by two colleagues, and implementation of the Eighth Directive in all Member States also calls for more work by the Commission."
"Of course it would be helpful if all the Member States had similar statutory requirements of financial accounts, and that is something which is yet to come."
"From the macro point of view it must be recognized that business has gone global during the time that we have been trying to achieve harmonized audit standards."
"Multinational companies, international companies and - hopefully one day - European companies will require harmonized audit rules to be in place."
"Naturally, the professions have moved with the times themselves and several auditing firms have become global in their activity."
"I feel a personal worry about the over-concentration of these firms into too few hands."
"It is my belief that there should be at least five multinational audit groups in the world."
"This is more necessary now that these firms offer advice and consultancy."
"Shareholders need to know that advice being offered to their companies is truly independent."
"The theory of Chinese walls is not good enough."
"Of course I realise Commissioner Gradin will tell me that the regulations concerning those problems are not part of this exercise, but those problems are looming and need to be ventilated and understood."
"Paragraph 7 has caused some problems and the wording of Amendment No 1 by Mrs Palacio does not in fact make absolutely clear what she intended, but her explanation this morning in the debate has made it clear that we can support that amendment."
"This group supports Mrs GonzÃ¡lez's report."
"Mr President, this debate concerns the future of auditing in Europe."
"Auditing and accounting are sometimes regarded as specialist topics which do not deserve any political attention."
"However, good auditing increases the likelihood that financial information is reliable. And reliable financial information is important for the single market."
"Those who make use of accounts regard the auditor's report as a guarantee that the calculations are reliable."
"There are few rules about auditing at the EU level."
"We have different auditing systems in the Member States, both with regard to the content of the audit and the standards to which it should be carried out."
"In many cases this lack of consensus obstructs the operation of the single market."
"It was against this background that the Commission issued its Green Paper, in order to start a highlevel debate in Europe on these issues."
"That was received well at a conference which the Commission arranged in December 1996."
"More than 200 representatives of government and business expressed their general support for the approach in the Green Paper."
"The position of the European Parliament is very important for our analysis."
"Your opinions will help us in the Commission to soon be able to draw up a Communication on auditing."
"Let me pick out some points of view."
"We are all agreed about starting work on creating a mechanism for auditing standards at the EU level."
"This mechanism may take the form of a technical sub-committee to the contact committee for the auditing directive."
"The sub-committee would consist of representatives of the Member States and professional bodies."
"I agree that users of auditor's reports should be closely connected with the work of the technical sub-committee."
"The sub-committee will in particular follow the work of the professional bodies and in due time show us whether legislation is required to achieve the objectives."
"The amendments tabled here concerning the independence of the auditors illustrate how important this question is, especially at a time when there is uncertainty about the future shape of the profession."
"Those who use auditor's reports have to be able to rely on the auditor being independent."
"Therefore it is necessary to decide what services other than auditing services which an auditor may carry out, and to ensure that these rules are followed."
"If the professional body does what is required, all well and good."
"If not we must consider legislation, because we are all agreed that the auditor has a key role in the company's control and supervision system."
"The Commission and the new sub-committee shall consider the various proposals which have been made in connection with the Green Paper and, of course, on the basis of the report which we are now debating here in Parliament."
"The question of the professional liability of auditors is very complex."
"We need to examine more closely how various systems affect the single market."
"On this point the Commission is currently carrying out a separate study on how questions of liability are dealt with in different countries."
"We are agreed that all current regulations in Member States which restrict the Treaty's fundamental provisions on freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services should be abolished."
"The Treaty provisions are fully applicable to trade in auditing services."
"We must make greater progress with regard to facilitating mutual recognition of auditors' qualifications between the Member States."
"With these points of view I would also like to give thanks to the rapporteur for a good piece of work."
"Thank you, Commissioner Gradin."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12: 00."
"Alpine transit"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:"
"B4-1009/97 - O-0111/97, by Mr Simpson, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to the Commission, on negotiations between the UN and Switzerland on overland transport; -B4-1014/97 - O-0138/97, by Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, to the Commission, on EU-Switzerland negotiations on land transport; -B4-1105/97 - O-0180/97, by Mr Jarzembowski, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, to the Commission, on negotiations between the European Union and Switzerland in the land transport sector; -B4-1106/97 - O-0181/97, by Mr Santini, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe, to the Commission, on Alpine transit; -B4-1107/97 - O-0183/97, by Mr Wijsenbeek, on behalf of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, to the Commission, on Alpine transit; -B4-1108/97 - O-0184/97, by Mrs Leperre-Verrier, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, to the Commission, on Alpine transit; -B4-1015/97 - O-0185/97, by Mr Puerta and Mr Papyannakis, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, to the Commission, on Alpine transit."
"Mr President, my remarks will be very much tailored towards the Commission."
"This particular issue - the issue of a transit agreement with Switzerland - has involved a long-running series of negotiations."
"It is rather like climbing a ladder: we seem to go up one or two rungs and then something happens which means that we slip down one or two rungs and end up right back where we started."
"At the moment, the problem seems to centre around the level of road tax levy on heavy goods vehicles passing through Swiss territory."
"We need to recognize that other problems arise because of this lack of an agreement."
"The congestion in Austria and Italy on the Brenner route is now so serious that the environment is being totally devastated and people who are avoiding Switzerland face great hold-ups."
"But there is also congestion on the French side of the Alps."
"The EU Member States are facing problems because we have failed to reach an agreement with the Swiss."
"We must also recognize the need to protect the Alpine environment, including the Alpine areas of Switzerland."
"The Swiss Government has, in recent weeks, shown some flexibility in the negotiations."
"That is to be welcomed."
"However, we need an agreement urgently - not at any cost, that has to be stated - that recognizes the needs and aspirations of both the European Union and Switzerland."
"I am grateful for the efforts in the past of Commissioner Kinnock and of the recent presidencies of the Netherlands and Luxembourg."
"The fact that the UK Presidency has taken on board this issue of an agreement shows how important it is."
"We need an agreement."
"We can all go to the barricades and defend our strong positions."
"The Swiss can hide behind the Alps."
"The European Union can hide behind its need for this transit."
"But if we do that, then the danger is that we will not get an agreement and the people who will suffer are the people of Austria, in the Brenner, of France and of Italy."
"Therefore I ask for a redoubling of our efforts to try to get this important transit agreement with Switzerland signed, sealed and delivered."
"Mr President, my group would like the Commission, in this case Commissioner van de Broek, to tell us whether the European efforts during the negotiations with Switzerland can be reconciled with the obligations the European Union committed itself to at an earlier time?"
"I am referring on the one hand to the transit agreement with Switzerland, but on the other hand to the Alpine Convention."
"According to the Alpine Convention which was signed by all Member States, and is therefore simply binding on us, the Union has committed itself to making efforts to switch transport across the Alps from road to rail."
"It says in the transit agreement that lorries passing through Switzerland must be charged the external costs, in particular the environmental costs."
"In the light of the obligations I do not consider it justifiable for the Commission and the Council to resist Switzerland's ambitions for a sufficiently high levy on heavy goods vehicles to bring about an actual transfer from road to rail."
"I would like to recall once more the Swiss referendum of 1994 which laid down that transit traffic must switch to rail before the year 2005."
"In the current negotiations with Switzerland, the Union is showing disgracefully little respect for the constitution of Switzerland, which is, after all, a sovereign country."
"Neighbourliness is cynically sacrificed to the interests of the road haulage lobby."
"I have to add, in particular Dutch road haulage, in this case."
"To my regret Minister Jorritsma is allowing himself to be used by the Netherlands, distribution country par excellence, as a kind of ventriloquist's dummy."
"Last Tuesday, this Parliament, in Mr Sarlis' report, underlined once again that transalpine transport should occur by rail as much as possible."
"We must be consistent, we must ensure that we actually realize this, and this means that we will have to take steps towards Switzerland."
"Mr President, I cannot entirely agree with the previous speaker, although I would like to."
"This is not a question of Dutch interests, if it were I should indeed be on your side, rather it is a question of Greek, Italian, Austrian, German, French and English interests. And I could cite many other Member States."
"Quite simply, we need to transit through the Alps."
"As far as we are concerned, it is not acceptable for the Swiss to say: We are happy in our isolation."
"Do whatever you want in the Brenner. Do whatever you want in France."
"We're shutting up shop and going home! My dear colleague, we could also let the Swiss know that anyone who makes it economically impossible for us to transit through Switzerland should watch out that we don't make coming out of Switzerland economically impossible, not to put to fine a point on it!"
"It is not acceptable that the interests of our businessmen and consumers are treated as if we constantly have to kowtow."
"Quite the opposite, we can use a two-track approach."
"We want to protect the environment."
"We want to move to rail. But I see no evidence that what the Swiss government wanted to do in order to move to rail has actually happened yet."
"To be honest, neither can I see any evidence that the Austrians, the Germans and the Italians are making as much progress with the Brenner Base Tunnel as they should be."
"But we can't blame the fact that we haven't got further with the railway on the heavy goods transporters and then clout them with exorbitant charges."
"Let me say it once quite bluntly: It is not acceptable for the Swiss to expect us to be grateful for dropping their claim for the passage from 410 to 360 Swiss francs."
"That is still unacceptable."
"We must tell the Swiss this."
"We must also tell them that they are part of a larger picture, namely the land transport debate."
"There are also many other issues which play a role in the negotiations."
"Our colleagues in Switzerland will have to think about what it is they want."
"I don't mind taking the part of the Swiss government."
"Thanks to their constitution they are in an extremely difficult position."
"However, I don't think they can simply announce that they're introducing an output-related heavy goods vehicle tax, say this is our standard and expect the rest of Europe to fall into line, just because they, the Swiss, say so!"
"We can't work together on that basis."
"I hope that the Swiss recognise that workers in Greece and Italy also have an interest in getting their goods to market."
"For this reason I believe we must tell the Swiss that we cannot and will not accept exorbitant charges."
"I would also say to some of the members of this House, including my colleague Mrs van Dijk: I often hear you say: If you would drop at least as far as the Austrian Brenner rate, we would be happy."
"My response is No!"
"If my memory serves me correctly, this Parliament supported the Commission in its legal action against the last toll increase in the Brenner."
"I would like to remind you that the Commission won't forget that."
"And so we should both press for a quick agreement with the Swiss."
"But, as Brian Simpson said, not at any price."
"Mr President, it seems clear that there are two main players involved in this game. On one side there are the citizens of Europe who, when it comes to this type of regulation, tend to defend their own territory, the environment, and thus their own lives; and on the other side - and we cannot dismiss these concerns - there are the needs of, for example, the road hauliers and all economic sectors linked to that activity."
"If not lives, there are certainly jobs to be defended on that side."
"So the Commission has a delicate role to play in the negotiations between Switzerland and the European Union."
"Everyone knows that the results of this agreement will also determine the transit conditions for all the other Community Alpine passes, starting with the Brenner, certainly the most delicate, the key point in the great north-south linkage, above all on completion - as soon as possible we hope - of the great rail axis linking, to take a rather optimistic view, Stockholm and Palermo."
"But we must return to the narrow scope of the Alpine passes."
"A Commission document says that the level of the future road tax should be directly linked to the effective infrastructure costs, and this also relates to the negotiations with Switzerland."
"Those costs include the maintenance and modernization of the infrastructure, but not new building or the external costs of road transport."
"In parallel, the European Union maintains that the level of road tax in Switzerland should be comparable to that applying to the Brenner."
"Clearly there are very close connections between the two dossiers."
"Apparently, Commissioner Kinnock actually hoped to be able to conclude the negotiations with Switzerland prior to agreement by the Fifteen on the Euro-stamp."
"Austria was hoping so too because, in short, they were waiting to find out what the Swiss toll would be so as to apply a heavier one to the Brenner and thus encourage the largest lorries to go through Switzerland."
"They are just keeping to the rules of the game, in sporting terms, and the Commission needs to be very careful to referee properly, because the agreement with Switzerland is at stake and so is internal credibility."
"The Brenner has already received special treatment in the great Alpine passes dispute thanks, remember, to a compromise plan based on four main points: a different tariff system, with vehicles classified Euro 0, Euro I and Euro II; a reduction of 50 % for countries like Greece and Ireland which have asked for this special tariff because of their geographic location; temporary derogations, up to the end of 1999, for Spain, France, Italy, Portugal and Greece."
"So I would like the Commissioner to explain the purpose of these guidelines, how the negotiations with Switzerland may alter them, as there are also figures given by the Commission: for example a daytime toll of ECU 72 is mentioned for a Euro 0 lorry, that is, a lorry in the four axles and over category, with ECU 165 for a night crossing."
"This situation becomes even more acute if we take a look at the statistics, which are important and show that in 2001 only 15 % of transit will be by rail and water and 81 % by road; at the moment the equivalent percentage is 72 %."
"So a solution must be urgently found, alongside the one, Mr Commissioner, mentioned here many times, of completing the rail infrastructure to give the road hauliers a genuine alternative."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, it is high time something was done."
"Because as long as the agreement has not been signed, there are unnecessary traffic diversions."
"This also means that where the lorries cross the Brenner route, we are giving the Austrians an opportunity to squeeze us unilaterally."
"It is good that the Commission is presently initiating a procedure against this."
"Mrs van Dijk and Mr Voggenhuber may keep repeating over and over again that freight has got to go by rail, but there are no facilities."
"There are too few facilities for getting lorries onto the railways."
"The height of the LÃ¶tschberg and Gotthard Tunnels have not been altered yet, and in Austria, absolutely nothing has been done about the Brenner railway."
"This means that we find ourselves in a situation in which we simply have to reach an agreement."
"That is also the fault of the Member States, which have left the Commission too little room to manoeuvre in the mandate."
"In a word, we agree that in the negotiations with Switzerland we must start with the right measurements."
"As a Community we therefore have to contribute to the fact that the Swiss in the new alpine transit tunnel agreement have promised us to alter, and indeed are in the process of, altering the height of two tunnels."
"They have stopped the work on one of the tunnels in the meantime, and it is still not possible to get on the train in Basel and to get off again at Chiasso."
"The Swiss had promised this."
"In a word, I would like to call on the Commission once more to enter into the negotiations in all peacefulness and openness."
"Mr President, we meet here today to discuss an important question."
"For months, negotiations with Switzerland have been at a standstill because of the transport problem."
"We therefore urgently need to take stock of the progress of our relationship with our Alpine neighbour."
"It seems that the Swiss authorities have agreed to make concessions."
"We therefore would like the Commission to give us some specific information on progress, which has been mentioned in the press."
"In fact, the problem of crossing Switzerland is of some consequence with regard to road traffic in the whole of the Alps."
"For that reason, I and the whole of my group consider that the EU's relationship with Switzerland with regard to transport cannot be isolated from the overall context of Alpine transit, and that the disastrous effects of the increase in road traffic on the environment must be taken into consideration urgently."
"Let me give a single example: the level of pollution in the valley of Chamonix is as high as in a large town because of the Mont Blanc Tunnel."
"It is therefore understandable that the inhabitants of the Mont-Blanc area, and also the Val d'Aosta area, should express concern with regard to the possible construction of a second tunnel."
"However, there are solutions."
"First of all, settling the dispute with Switzerland and setting up a pricing system, which will encourage the use of pollution control equipment."
"Secondly, and this is a very important aspect, promoting rail transport and developing piggyback transport systems."
"Of course, the changeover from road to rail will be expensive, and will necessitate large investments. But do not let us forget that this is a solution for the future."
"Within this context, the Lyon to Turin HST link, including freight transport, when the MonmÃ©lian to Turin rail tunnel is built, will facilitate combined transport in the Alps."
"It is therefore necessary to make this project a reality and for the Member States to commit themselves to building the necessary infrastructures."
"Furthermore, special attention should be paid to the rail project linking Geneva via MÃ¢con, Bourg-en-Bresse or ChambÃ©ry."
"The new President of the Swiss Republic has made optimistic remarks on the future relationship between the European Union and Switzerland."
"Let us hope that it will enable us to sort out this difficult situation."
"Thank you, Mrs Leperre-Verrier."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is something I wanted to ask you."
"Mr Baldarelli has asked if he can bring his speech forward as he has to leave immediately for Italy."
"I do not have competence to change the order of the agenda and the order of precedence in the right to speak, but, if no-one objects, I could satisfy Mr Baldarelli's request with the recommendation that he shorten his speech."
"If no-one objects, that is what I will do."
"Mr President, I think we should hear the Commissioner and then no one else, otherwise we will have to plan another round."
"It is not acceptable that anyone should be given preference."
"I suggest that the Commissioner speak, that we finish and take the vote."
"No other speakers should be allowed to speak after the Commissioner."
"Thank you, Mr Jarzembowski."
"Naturally, there is an objection."
"Mr Baldarelli, I cannot grant your request."
"Mr President, this debate is certainly taking place at an interesting time, both because of the phase which the negotiations with Switzerland have now reached, and because the current phase in the internal discussion within the Union is particularly centred on road transport charging."
"As the honourable Members of Parliament know, realistic progress was made during the most recent Transport Council last month."
"The Commission continues to hope that during the presidency, our work concerning the most important obstacles can be completed in a satisfactory way."
"I would like to point out that although this debate is concentrating on transport problems, the negotiations with Switzerland cover a large number of dossiers, and that the agreement within the Union, which the Commission also wishes to retain, is that the negotiations in the different sectors must be brought to a balanced completion, both within the sectors as such, and between the sectorial dossiers."
"As far as overland transport is concerned, we have always striven towards laying the foundations for the gradual development of a cohesive policy and the achievement of comparable conditions for sustainable transport across the Alps."
"We have made considerable progress towards agreement with the Swiss, and agree with Switzerland on the following points."
"Increases in the maximum weight of lorries in Switzerland from 28 to 40 tonnes in two phases, which will commence in 2001 and which must be completed in 2005."
"This in combination with the introduction of a new charging system on a kilometre basis for road transport in Switzerland."
"Second point of agreement: liberalization and adjustment of the promise concerning the infrastructure development for railway corridors through Switzerland."
"Also liberalization with regard to railway capacity, and as regards the quality and price of the service, in particular for combined transport, as well as a more liberal promise with regard to the integration of the Swiss railway system within the same legislative context in which it also exists in the Union."
"Moreover, on the development of so-called high speed freight freeways."
"Suitable protective measures have been agreed to remedy the imbalances within Alpine transport."
"Lastly, agreement on a number of improvements which can be made immediately on access and transit opportunities for 40 tonne lorries."
"As you are aware, there are still considerable differences of opinion on a number of not insignificant details. Particularly as far as the tolls for driving on Swiss roads, to be set in 2001 and 2005, respectively, are concerned."
"Other complex problems relate to the possible levying of tolls on the four most important passes through the Swiss Alps, a ban on night journeys, and transition quotas for 40 tonne lorries. The Swiss have expressed their sympathy for the Union's concerns, and as the negotiations progressed, have showed themselves willing to make efforts to meet those concerns on a large number of points."
"Now that there is a realistic political willingness on both sides, it can be reasonably assumed that the remaining differences of opinion will also be ironed out."
"So far as the so-called equal treatment is concerned, the Commission can confirm that the principle of nondiscrimination would form an integral part in the future agreement with Switzerland, and that both parties agree on this point."
"Last year during the talks about the proposal for a Commission Directive concerning user rights for the roads, the so-called Euro-sticker problem, the Transport Council was not prepared to accept the opinions of the Commission on the concept of sensitive areas."
"The Council is now looking at the possibility of including an Alpine clause, so that within certain obvious limits, and under certain conditions, a higher user's levy could be applied on the relevant Austrian route, a higher user's levy than the average charge."
"This clause, combined with a satisfactory outcome to the negotiations with Switzerland, is intended to help spread traffic over the entire Alpine region in a sustainable way, and that this is maintained."
"Both the Commission and the Council have pointed out emphatically that, either during the negotiations with Switzerland, or during the talks on the Alpine clause, we cannot agree to an outcome which would make the Alpine route exorbitantly expensive."
"To answer Mrs van Dijk, the European Community is obviously party to the Alpine Treaty."
"Parliament can therefore rely on the Commission to see to it that the Community will meet its obligations under the Alpine Treaty, and will attune its transport policy to the aims of the Treaty."
"The Commission does believe, however, that little will be achieved by designating the entire Alps a sensitive region."
"It would be much more useful if agreement could be reached within the Union about the Transport Protocol in the Alpine Convention."
"Regrettably one Member State as yet has not been able to agree with the proposals which are acceptable to all parties entering into the agreement."
"To conclude, Mr President, it should be mentioned that the Commission was pleased with the result of the Transport Council of the past month in which the Member States asked the Commission to continue negotiations on the basis of Switzerland's most recent proposal, and to prepare an agreement which, amongst other things, will provide for charges based on infrastructure costs, and which provides for an increase of the quota for 40 tonne lorries for the period 1999-2005."
"No doubt this matter will be looked at again during the next Transport Council in March, after which the Commission will obviously inform this Parliament of the latest developments via the usual channels."
"In view of the magnitude of the issue and the lack of time, Mr President, I do not want to go into all the other aspects."
"I hope that the esteemed members of Parliament will understand this, and I for my part will of course try to formulate an answer to specific questions at the end of this debate."
"The debate will continue at 3 p.m. this afternoon."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"There is a rumour going round that a recent edition of the Official Journal, published in the Finnish language, has had to be scrapped and is about to be reprinted."
"I should like to ask the presidency to look into this and report back to Parliament the full circumstances."
"It appears that it relates to a Parliament advertisement in the Finnish Official Journal seeking, in the Finnish language, to recruit for our Legal Service an A3, and I quote in as far as I understand Finnish, ' to be in charge of a group of idiots' ."
"I have described our Legal Service as all sorts of things but that has not entered the vocabulary."
"Could you ask for an investigation to see how it occurred and what steps are being taken to make sure that the culprit pays for the reprinting?"
"Thank you, Mr Tomlinson."
"I shall ask the Secretary-General to find someone in the services who is not an idiot to respond to you."
"Votes"
"Mr President, this is a short but very complicated report which generated a high level of consensus on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"The committee unanimously backed seven amendments."
"Several were acceptable to the Commission, as indicated last night, and some were opposed by the Commission."
"I believe from the debate, which was adequately attended at 11.30 p.m. last night, that there is room for further exploration and dialogue between Parliament and the Commission on some sensitive aspects of this."
"Rather than develop the point and substance at this stage, my preference would be to take advantage of more time for reflection, to refer the report back to committee and then to return here with something acceptable to both institutions."
"(Parliament referred the report back to committee)"
"Yes, Mr President, after discussing this with my colleague, Mr Schwaiger, I would like to propose an oral amendment to simplify the amendment I proposed earlier, to delete the words 'the setting of' ."
"So I agree to the removal of the words 'the setting of' from the amendment I tabled."
"(Parliament agreed to the oral amendment)"
"Mr President, once the word ""setting' has been removed so that the Council of Europe does not set the exchange rate we can adopt this amendment and the whole report."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"We would like to thank the rapporteur for his report."
"We think, however, that there is reason to be sceptical about the structure of the system of compensation which the report has to consider."
"It is a position which should not be seen as a lack of understanding of the role which the sale of fishery products plays for the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French department of Guiana, and of the need for solidarity with the peripheral areas of the Community."
"However, we believe that structures of the type covered by the proceedings are impeding an essential reform of the common fisheries policy."
"The Committee on Fisheries' legislative proposal does not help to change this relationship, rather the reverse."
"d'Ancona report (A4-0402/97)"
"Mr President, the aim of what is called the Eurodac Convention is to set up a European database of fingerprints of asylum seekers, in order to determine, pursuant to the Dublin Convention of 15 June 1990, which is the Member State of first application, and consequently, which Member State is responsible for examining the application."
"The Europe of Nations Group is overall in favour of this Convention, under the inter-governmental system of the present Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union."
"We should just like to point out that the Council has not clearly explained all the reasons for its actions, and that is rather a pity, as they are perfectly feasible."
"There is no reason why citizens should not know about them."
"There are in fact habitual false asylum seekers who, having failed in one Member State, are likely to try their luck in all the others in turn, in order to turn a possible loophole to their advantage."
"It would be useful to be able to detect them in order to prevent the same application being considered two, three or four times."
"But as these people change their names each time, it is difficult to detect them other than by fingerprinting."
"However, the Council has had the bad idea of putting a finger into the Community pie, making the Court of Justice responsible, providing funding from the European budget and consulting the European Parliament on the whole thing, although in our opinion according to Article K.6, it did not have to."
"The result is that this House has leapt into the breach, voting amendments that have put the system back into the hands of the Commission, which has made sure that it is managed entirely by the Community, and is trying to weaken its scope."
"Of course, we are opposed to these amendments."
"We would like to thank the rapporteur for a thorough piece of work on the report."
"We would emphasize that the introduction of a system to compare the fingerprints of asylum seekers is not in itself a guarantee that we will achieve the desired humane and generous asylum policy which means that the Member States together provide asylum seekers a right of asylum."
"In order for such an asylum policy to be achieved we need other measures and far-reaching work which will increase the consensus between the Member States on the need for a generous and humane asylum policy."
"On the other hand, we think the setting up of Eurodac should be seen in the light of the opportunity to achieve such a generous and humane asylum policy within the European Union."
"The amendments to the Council's legislation which are expressed in the report entail a strengthening of the natural right of integrity of asylum seekers, which we see as a good reason to support the report."
"We are very critical of the Council's proposal to set up the Eurodac database."
"Eurodac could result in a far more restrictive and brutal refugee policy by the Member States in the European Union."
"Every application for asylum must be dealt with separately, regardless of whether the asylum seeker has previously sought asylum in another EU country."
"We are therefore critical of the grounds for setting up the Eurodac database, which are that an application for asylum should only be dealt with in one country."
"Our view is that refugees should have the same right of personal integrity as our citizens."
"We take exception to the routine taking of fingerprints of refugees."
"The logic of this rule also means that in extreme cases force and violence may be required against people from the age of 14 years."
"The rules which exist for the erasing of data from the central database are also inadequate."
"In the current computer system the guarantees are insufficient to ensure that all data has really been erased."
"It must also be clear that no data on people who have received a residence permit in one of the EU's Member States should remain on the database."
"The supervisory authority's powers need to be further clarified."
"The same also applies to the ability of asylum seekers to obtain information about their rights and to check the accuracy of the data."
"The draft report directs substantial criticism against Eurodac with which we agree."
"We are therefore voting for the report in its entirety in the final vote."
"However, we have voted against certain parts of the report."
"The European Commission is a bureaucratic institution with very weak democratic control."
"Secondly, we are strongly opposed to the Council being able to make decisions by qualified majority voting in the implementation of Eurodac."
"Our fundamental view is that cooperation on this kind of issue should be conducted at intergovernmental level."
"Today the Danish Social Democrats voted for a report concerning the setting up of a database (Eurodac) of the fingerprints of asylum seekers."
"We believe that such a database is a necessary tool when deciding which Member State is responsible for dealing with an application for asylum presented within the EU."
"Eurodac can also help prevent asylum seekers becoming political footballs between the different countries because no-one will accept responsibility for dealing with their case."
"It can also help to prevent cheating, i.e. prevent asylum seekers from changing identity after being rejected by one Member State."
"We support the d'Ancona report because it emphasizes the fact that the database must not compromise the asylum seeker's legal protection."
"We also believe it could be an advantage both with regard to efficiency and data protection to involve the Commission in the administration of the database."
"The National Front has always and will always fight against illegal immigration."
"Efficient control of asylum applications and criteria is one of the means of stemming the migratory flow."
"The Eurodac computerised system of recognition of the fingerprints of asylum seekers, makes it possible to bring together any legal or criminal information about them, and thus enables a Member State to have some control of asylum requests."
"On sight of the personal data available on an individual, the Member State can grant or conclusively refuse an asylum application."
"In this report, Mrs d'Ancona proposes to take away from Member States their supreme authority in this respect."
"She considers that the Eurodac system should be managed by the Commission and not by the Member States."
"She also introduces more restrictive limits to the use of the system."
"Once again, it a question of the dissolution of the Member States and their authority, in an area which, by nature, should belong to them."
"The aberration imposed by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which brings the laws and internal affairs of Member States within the scope of the Community, is once again apparent here, in all its splendour."
"The great European 'sieve' is becoming more and more of a reality."
"We have had the Europe of Schengen, which removed the internal borders of the European Union, and here we have the Europe of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is removing its external borders."
"The undersigned Members are very critical of the Eurodac database which the Council wants to set up."
"Eurodac is part of the far more restrictive and brutalizing refugee policy which is emerging within the EU, a policy which often means that refugees are treated as if they were criminals."
"We think that every application for asylum should be dealt with separately, regardless of whether the asylum seeker has previously sought asylum in another EU country."
"We therefore question the basis of the Eurodac system, the aim of which is that an application for asylum should only be dealt with in one country."
"We believe that refugees have the same right of personal integrity as other people."
"It is therefore unreasonable to routinely take the fingerprints of refugees."
"This is particularly serious because in extreme cases such a rule requires that force and violence may be used against people from the age of 14 years."
"We think that the rules on erasing data on the central database are inadequate."
"Obviously nobody who has received a residence permit in a Member State should risk having his or her data remaining on the database."
"We also think the supervisory authority's powers are unclear and inadequate."
"The same applies to the ability of asylum seekers to obtain information about their rights and to check the accuracy of the data."
"In Mrs d'Ancona's report substantial criticism is directed against Eurodac, criticism which largely corresponds with our views."
"We have, however, voted against all parts of the report which mean that the Commission would be responsible for the database."
"The European Commission is a body which is under very weak democratic control."
"We also think that cooperation on this kind of issue should be intergovernmental."
"Erika Mann report (A4-0403/97)"
"We have voted for the resolution because we think it would be correct to develop economic and commercial relations with the USA."
"At the same time, however, we think that the resolution avoids criticizing the USA on several points where it would have been proper to do so."
"For example, on the issue of human rights it would have been appropriate to point out that a majority of the States in the USA use the death penalty."
"On the issue of the environment, attention could have been drawn to the USA's opposition to more extensive international agreements in the area of the environment, most recently manifested in Kyoto."
"As far as the labour market is concerned, attention could be drawn to the strong anti-union actions which many US employers take, often with the full acceptance of the authorities."
"Sierra GonzÃ¡lez report (A4-0399/97)"
"Mr President, the report by Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez relates to the use of the information society, that is, more clearly, electronic means such as the Internet, in the service of economic and social cohesion and to combat unemployment."
"We cannot fail to approve her wish to see the information society of use to all, including and particularly, the least developed regions and the most underprivileged people."
"We also appreciate her proposal to increase training throughout people's careers, or indeed the determination to respect multi-lingualism within the information society."
"Furthermore, the report rightly emphasizes the positive effect, which the information society can have on rural areas."
"Thanks to teleworking, which can enable many types of professional activity to be carried out in the country, it can be an important factor of balanced development of urban and rural areas."
"However, it is necessary for us to ensure that the information society does not become a two-edged sword."
"Once again, may I emphasize the danger that these new technologies could facilitate the relocation of part of the service sector of the European Union to countries where wages are low and social protection is poor?"
"European companies are already having their accounts or customer service departments transferred to India or Singapore."
"This constitutes a serious risk to employment in the Community, which we must take adequate measures to counter."
"We are also pleased to note that the rapporteur has taken a keen interest in our concern with regard to this matter."
"That is why the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has decided to support Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez's report, and at the same time, applauds its consensual nature."
"The report on cohesion and the information society, on which we will vote today, is complementary to the Green Paper entitled 'Living and working in the Information Society - People First' ."
"This document has the merit of analysing the consequences of the emergence of new information and communications technologies (ICT) on cohesion and on the various regions of the European Union."
"For my part, I will confine myself to two areas: the consequences for individual citizens and the effect on regional disparities."
"As far as the human dimension is concerned, for several years, we have concentrated our efforts on the development of the above-mentioned technologies from the angle of the development of employment."
"As the excellent report by my colleague, Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez stresses, it is not certain that they will create more jobs than they destroy."
"However, they must be developed in a manner that puts the individual first."
"With regard to training, young people must be able to keep up with the developments of this new society."
"We must start by making an effort to ensure that primary and secondary schools and training centres have the right equipment."
"Thanks to this new equipment, a qualified, efficient labour force will emerge, and will be in great demand."
"We must also make an effort at the level of the economic operator."
"I am referring to measures to support SMEs and SMIs."
"As they themselves become users of new technologies, they are becoming a source of highly qualified jobs."
"As far as the geographical dimension is concerned, it is obvious that the development of ICTs is likely to increase regional disparities."
"One only has to consider that in terms of users, the percentage ownership of computers, particularly in rural areas, is low."
"We must therefore make an effort with regard to infrastructure and encourage the creation of networks."
"As Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez' report rightly emphasizes, barely 2 % of the structural funds have the right finality."
"Until now, the action taken has been confined to basic equipment (telephone lines, etc)."
"The areas in which the structural funds are used must be reviewed, in order to diversify."
"Access to new information and communication technologies can be facilitated if we make room for them in schools, libraries and public centres."
"Similarly, let us support the innovative experiments of SMEs, and accompanying measures in their favour."
"The Commission, which could act as a driving force, must provide encouragement using the resources it has available."
"In the introduction to her report, Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez states that the information society is the most significant economic, cultural and political challenge of these final years of the century."
"I concur with that statement, although I am very concerned about the current process of globalization and interdependence of economies."
"I am afraid that cohesion within the European Union may be endangered by the unequal division of the benefits of technological progress."
"In fact there is the risk that the investments will be delayed in some regions."
"The spread of technology does not mean automatic sharing of opportunities and the enormous benefits."
"The development of the information society absolutely must be complemented by adequate political action which guarantees even development across all the regions of the European Union."
"This is because there are countries where the culture of the information society is more widespread than elsewhere, and naturally they have greater opportunities to utilize the new technologies and advance and prosper in this new work environment."
"The great challenge for the European Union as a whole is that 30 % of Americans are interested in this development, while only 2 % of Europeans are."
"This gives the United States a clear advantage over us, which means we have to trail behind."
"It is a shame, because we have great potential but we are not succeeding in fulfilling it so, we are losing jobs compared to the USA."
"We need to be more united and we particularly need to devote more resources to research and development."
"The continuous use of the technology by SMEs will constitute an essential factor for competitiveness."
"The information society offers the SMEs the possibility of creating highly specialized new jobs and reducing unemployment."
"Above all in the less favoured regions and in the rural areas, the SMEs represent the backbone of the local economy."
"The rapid evolution of modern technology and the globalization of markets influences competitive conditions and creates new opportunities for SMEs. They then have an essential role in increasing the economic and social cohesion of the European Union."
"Mr President, many of the less developed regions of the European Union suffer from the problem of peripherality."
"Technological advance particularly in the context of the information society is one method of overcoming the problem of geographical dislocation."
"Information and communication technologies have a significant contribution to make to boosting both the overall competitiveness of Europe and also improving regional cohesion."
"Unfortunately, however, different regions are moving at a different pace because of the imbalance in their respective use of information technology."
"In order to halt this unequal development it is important that more structural funding is invested in this area."
"There is also a lot to be gained from the sharing of experience in this field."
"I would like to draw the Commission's attention to an innovative pilot experiment that is being introduced in my constituency in Ennis, Co. Clare."
"Ennis was selected in a competition organised by Telecom Eireann and designated as an 'Information Age Town' and the project will examine the benefits of the application of many aspects of information and communication technology."
"I would hope that the Commission will monitor this and similar projects in other countries to discover what lessons can be learnt and applied to other parts of the European Union in an attempt to contribute to regional cohesion."
"Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡lez has given us an excellent piece of work, and I cannot fail to agree with her vision of the utility and shared benefits of the information society."
"Indeed, as the elected representative of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region, I can see that the availability of new information technologies and their use, by companies of course, but also by individual citizens, can enable an underprivileged area affected by a high level of unemployment, to catch up economically and socially."
"That is what is happening in my region."
"Our rapporteur is therefore right to emphasize the need to give all regions an opportunity to invest in telecommunications and information infrastructures."
"This sector is as important as training and vocational qualifications and/or the role played by the public and private sectors."
"This should be a national priority as well as a European priority."
"It is one of the means of combating exclusion."
"Once again, based on the practical example of my region - without the help of European programmes such as web for school and net days, our regional and local authorities would not have been able on their own to provide our young people with the information technology equipment which they now have available."
"That is why I support the rapporteur, so that the aid she asks for may be generalised and even extended."
"The Commission's findings and estimates, and much more so those in the report by Mrs Sierra GonzÃ¡les, reflect today's reality of unequally distributed possibilities for access to and real utilization of the information society among Europe's various regions."
"However, the proposals in the Commission's Green Paper do not respond to the needs created by technological progress and the aspirations of Europe's peoples for making the most of it to reduce and eliminate regional inequalities and to improve the living standards of working people."
"On the contrary, the proposed liberalization of the telecommunications market will downgrade the services offered, especially in less-developed areas, and will make it more difficult for citizens, organizations and businesses to have access to the networks, so increasing the already existing inequalities."
"The lack of infrastructure and appropriate equipment to make the most of the potential offered by today's electronic systems and multimedia, especially in remote areas which have considerable difficulty in connecting up to central networks because of the high costs involved, as well as the lack of education and training in their perfection and use, constitute a negative factor for development leading to an extension of the gap between the information haves and have-nots."
"A central element of these proposals is to further the increase of profits for the major enterprises in the sector, to the cost of public services and of the social role which they should play."
"The abolition of public services, and of the corresponding obligation of the state to ensure the access of all citizens to the services offered, cannot be replaced by deceptive and false statements about universal services whose content remains unknown, and which are essentially a cover to allow the way to open towards still greater overconcentration of capital and of the means that control the transmission and spread of information, ultimately ending in the creation of a huge industry of news and information production as is already happening in many cases with SMEs."
"To promote those aims a tactic is being mobilized to avert social reaction and create a new organization of labour."
"An element of that organization is the proposed spread of tele-employment, which will have strikingly detrimental effects on the social, unionistic and employment rights of working people."
"How are businesses with 'outdated' means and restricted access to investment capital to compete with the vast multinational organizations?"
"The abolition of state support and the limited Community subsidies, which for example provide financial assistance for telecommunications from the structural funds only to an extent of 2 %, operate to prohibit indiscriminate access to all the information available on the network and equal and impartial conditions of connection and interaction."
"However, the people and the workers will not allow the implementation of plans whose result would be to exacerbate the already existing differences. They will react against the already perceptible dangers of dislocation, isolation and depression of remote and structurally weak areas, and will not allow the ambitions of capital to entrap and bleed dry the 'grey matter' of Europe and bring about the suppression of citizens' rights, acquisitions and liberties."
"Waddington report (A4-0405/97)"
"I was very interested to read the report by Mr Waddington, whom I wish to congratulate."
"There is no doubt that whenever the European Parliament has to vote on a subject relating to employment, there is no lack of lively debate between political currents and political powers."
"Whereas the Luxembourg Employment Summit in November concentrated mainly on training, the rapporteur has rightly observed that there is a wide gap between the political commitments and the proposals made by the Commission in this area."
"I sometimes wonder why some of our Commissioners, always eager to advocate ever more liberalism, suddenly become paralysed, when the question of combating unemployment arises."
"I cannot believe that they have no wish to combat this scourge."
"So I support the questions Mr Waddington has asked the Commission without reservations."
"I hope the Commission will reply."
"I approve of the direction of this report, which wants a close connection between access to training and the organization of work."
"We cannot and must not isolate the various problems relating to employment."
"The solutions are only effective inasmuch as they are interdependent."
"I therefore share Mr Waddington's concern with regard to the need for the professional diversification of female workers."
"I think that we need to go further in this diversification, which should not be confined to women, equality is obligatory..."
"We must be wary of the pitfalls of training mainly for jobs relating to new technologies and services."
"Many such jobs are of low value and cannot be multiplied indefinitely."
"Disappointments are in store for us."
"Once again, I should like to congratulate Mr Waddington."
"Like him, I would like some serious proposals from the Commission."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted for a report on access to continuing training in the European Union."
"It is very important to focus attention on continuing training and further education in the present time, when adaptability and flexibility are of crucial importance for the chances of workers to cope in a constantly changing employment market."
"The competitiveness of European businesses depends to a large extent on our efforts in the area of continuing training."
"If we do not pay attention to these challenges it will cost jobs in Europe."
"We therefore support a report which calls for comparable statistics on continuing training in the Member States and recommends the setting up of a reporting system on access to training."
"We are particularly pleased that the rapporteur puts great emphasis on the equal opportunities aspect and the problems women can have with regard to access to continuing training."
"Finally, we would also like to support the request to the social partners at the European level to enter into framework agreements on training."
"Hermange report (A4-0292/97)"
"We have reason to thank the rapporteur for carrying out the work on this report."
"The report concerns an area which is important for our ability to increase productivity and employment, something which is also emphasized in the Committee's draft resolution."
"However, we would like to express a view on one point."
"We are critical of government stimuli in the form of tax concessions in line with what is said in the first indent of paragraph 9 of the report."
"As far as the opportunity for employees to share in company profits is concerned, we think this is a matter for the social partners, and it is the duty of society to remain neutral and not to intervene through tax subsidies."
"We voted against this resolution."
"The Swedish Left has always thought that the people who work in a company should have a major influence, both over the total corporate environment and over the application of profits."
"We think it is a great mistake to one-sidedly emphasize individual shareholdings as a driving force for increased productivity in this way."
"We would instead like a dynamic and creative development of corporate democracy."
"We would like to stress the need for funds for the future and long-term continuous training in companies, instead of individual shareholdings."
"The National Front always has and always will defend the position and role of the individual within the firm."
"We refuse to consider the individual as a variable or piece of economic data, as all policies on the left or the right invariably have done up until now, and without any encouraging or positive future result."
"In this report, Mrs Hermange gives employees a real economic dimension, which we cannot fail to applaud."
"We should encourage this form of popular capitalism, and develop measures that encourage the participation of workers in the capital of firms."
"In order to combat unemployment, it is necessary in fact for workers to regain their confidence, in order to increase productivity, and the flexibility of work and wages."
"But in order to achieve the aims of stability of employment and growth, it is necessary to protect the market, to throw out all the false precepts of Maastricht and Amsterdam, to staunch the migrant flow and give consumer spending a boost."
"Then and only then will new jobs be created."
"Our reservations on this matter do not stem from specific doubts, which we could easily find and which would easily serve to justify our vote."
"However, stating these reservations would also be a way of remaining aloof from the real heart of the matter on which our position is based."
"It would certainly be a way out of saying what has to be said, substituted by formal observations."
"And nor is it a question of whether or not you trust in the goodness of the policies and measures proposed on which reports will be made in this Parliament."
"Clearly, our concept of social relations is not compatible with the illusion that other concepts, or the lack of them, insist there are no social classes or that, although they exist, their interests and objectives in private company economic activities are coincidental, converging or simply non-conflicting."
"On that account, irrespective of valuable opinions on the intentions of the policies and measures, and also of those signing the reports, which may be excellent, and in some cases are, these policies and measures may have the harmful effect of diverting attention, of diverting men and women from the real questions relating to male and female workers, which will never cease to exist as they have been granted a moderate participation in certain limited areas of management and in the financial results comprising the appropriation of the proceeds of their work."
"This strategy is not a new one, and long reflection on this matter reminds us that around 30 years ago, when similar policies and measures were presented as remedies, we read and wrote that participation (of workers in the management and results) was a kind of ""red light' at the end of a series of situations formed by a highly degenerated social situation to ask for basic solutions or giving rise to mere diversions, which had precedents and has repetitions."
"We would review this position if it were not confirmed by reality."
"But reality has proven that it is right."
"It will happen again now."
"For that reason, our vote is not against the excellent intentions, of those who hold them, but cannot be in favour of an illusion that is revived and that aspires to communicate with those who do not need them, or who should flee from them, like a scalded cat."
"Resolution on the situation of the Kurdish refugees"
"Mr President, on behalf on behalf of the Green Group I would like to protest in the strongest possible terms against the complete erosion of general refugee rights of which we have seen repeated examples in the past few months."
"As regards the Kurdish refugees we have established that, on the one hand the EU Presidency and the EU Council of Ministers say in December that Turkey has no concrete prospect of joining the Union, rightly to my mind, partly because of the fact that the Kurdish issue is not being dealt with in a political manner."
"On the other hand we then when see small groups of refugees, because we are not talking about floods of refugees, we are talking of a mere few hundred, this same European Union adopts an extremely evasive attitude."
"In my own country, in Belgium, the Minister for Foreign Affairs says that because there is a hunger strike, we will investigate the political question which this problem poses, whilst on the other hand it was stated a long time ago that it is a political problem."
"In other countries you get the fight between Italy and Germany, for example."
"But in any case, the fundamental line taken by the European Union was not the recognition of the fact some political refugees from the region might come here."
"We find this extremely sad."
"The same is happening again with regard to the escalating drama in Algeria."
"This morning some German ministers declared publicly; yes, we will have to do something for Algeria, because otherwise the waves will hit us again."
"If we are going to conduct international and internal politics in these terms within the EU, we are absolutely on the wrong track."
"Europe today is faced with the problem of thousands of Kurds illegally disembarking on the Italian coast, at the end of a voyage obviously organized by Mafia organizations and professional people smugglers."
"Are they really refugees and if so, are they political or economic refugees?"
"Also, are they from Turkey or Northern Iraq?"
"Can people who themselves are (or who have been) persecutors, be recognized as refugees?"
"Let us not forget that the Kurds have always been the great slaughterers of Syrian, Chaldean, Nestorian and other Armenian Christians, and that quite recently (no later than 1984), they perpetrated massacres in Southern Anatolia."
"This influx of refugees, or false refugees, poses Europe a problem of incoherence."
"Firstly, it is not by chance that this problem has come to light today, when Italy has only been an integral part of the 'Schengen space' since 26 October 1997."
"It is clear that, to illegal immigrants, the prospect of being able to travel, without any border controls, from the far South to the far North of Europe, is a powerful incentive."
"As for the country of arrival of the immigrants, Italy in this case, what incentive does it have to resist them, when it knows that they will not stay in Italy, but are only passing through?"
"Why should Italy earn itself a bad reputation, from a humanitarian point of view, without any benefit to itself, but only to its neighbours?"
"This experience shows us that Schengen provides an additional incentive for illegal immigrants, and takes away the responsibility of the first host country."
"The re-establishment of real individual controls at internal borders would already solve part of the problem."
"Secondly, we are told that this type of situation would not occur if the right of asylum were harmonized throughout Europe."
"It is true that Italy is using it too extensively if, as is being said, even economic refugees are being accepted under the Geneva Convention."
"But on the other hand, what is this harmonized right of asylum that we could have instead, at the European level?"
"It is in fact exactly the same, that is, an extended right of asylum, as the proposal on refugees recently submitted to the Council by the Commission, shows."
"We do not see the point of harmonization at the European level, if the result is going to be even more laxity."
"If a country wants to be laxist, it should do so by itself and under its own responsibility, and not pass the problem on to its neighbours, or to Europe."
"Thirdly, the proposals for a European refugee policy (of which the resolution adopted yesterday by the European Parliament is a good example) consists above all, of sharing responsibility between the Member States for welcoming and providing for refugees."
"That is not a sensible long-term solution."
"What will we do tomorrow if, as is unfortunately possible, hundreds of thousands of refugees arrive from all over the world, attracted to Europe by its welcome, its promise of status and financial aid?"
"If we wish to behave responsibly, we must set up solutions today which will work tomorrow."
"That is why the European refugee policy should be:"
"1) To maintain controls at internal borders in order to ensure Member States accept responsibility;"
"2) To keep to a strict definition of the right of asylum;"
"3) To organize cooperation in order to provide financial aid for Member States who play a disproportionately large part in the supervision of external borders;"
"4) To find solutions other than allowing refugees to settle in the EU, if they are from countries far from our immediate area: on the contrary, such refugees should be sent to third countries able to offer them a suitable asylum, even if we have to provide aid to such countries."
"If the European Union adopts a different policy, as it now seems tempted to do, it will do serious harm to the longterm interests of our countries and will be unworthy of its citizens' trust."
"The Kurdish problem will continue to get worse and to come up before us so long as the Turkish authorities persist in their flagrant violation of the fundamental human rights of an entire people, stubbornly refusing to progress towards the search for a political and peaceful solution of the Kurdish issue by direct negotiations with all the representative bodies of the Kurdish people."
"So long as major economic and political, oil-related interests continue to back Turkey's intransigence, criminal groups favoured by Turkey's tolerant attitude will continue the illegal transport of Kurds under the most inhuman conditions, while 'well-governed' Member States 'sensitive' to human rights try in unacceptable ways to exploit the drama of the refugees in order to intensify their policing and oppressive measures."
"It is now urgently necessary to persuade the Turkish government to change its policy, to cease its warlike escapades against the Kurdish people and to recognise their rights."
"It is essential for the issue of the violation of those rights and Turkey's attitude to be raised at the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and before the Human Rights Commission of the Council of Europe."
"All necessary steps should be taken to intensify the struggle against the criminal networks which transport illegal immigrants and refugees, and at the same time all the necessary prerequisites must be put in hand to ensure respect for the right of refugees to request political asylum, pursuant to the Geneva Convention, and to receive immediate and effective material and moral support."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted for a resolution on Kurdish refugees."
"The unhappy and tragic situation of the Kurdish refugees has highlighted the need for cooperation on refugee policy in the EU."
"We would also like to urge people not to overreact."
"The Kurdish example shows once more that the debate has become a little overheated."
"In reality fewer than 1, 000 Kurds are involved, and the total number of asylum seekers actually fell in the EU in 1997."
"It is a shame and a disgrace that people in need are hitched to the anti-EU wagon in Denmark."
"There is a clear need for an instrument like Eurodac which we have also voted on today."
"It will help us to determine which Member State is responsible for dealing with an application for asylum in the EU."
"In addition, there should be a responsible sharing of the burden of refugees between the EU countries."
"I have voted against the joint resolution because it follows the Italian Government's approach of taking a favourable view of asylum applications from citizens of Kurdish origin."
"This introduces the dangerous precedent of granting political asylum on an ethnic basis."
"In the case in point, there has been a classic initial flow of Kurdish immigrants from different countries - together with other clandestine immigrants from the Maghreb, China, Sri Lanka, Egypt, and so on - impelled by economic reasons."
"Moreover, after the first major landing from the M.V. Ararat, we are witnessing a daily and constant trickle of landings of small groups of Kurdish immigrants organized by the Albanian ""scafisti' ."
"Political asylum on an ethnic basis amounts to a clear call to all Kurds to come to one of the EU countries, attracted by a blanket asylum opportunity which is based purely and simply on the fact that they are Kurds."
"The principle of asylum on an ethnic basis is not manageable either in the case of the Kurds, which constitute an ethnic grouping of over twenty million people, or in the case of the many peoples who, for religious, linguistic, political or economic reasons, are persecuted by other peoples or by other majorities."
"Suffice it to mention the case of the Tibetans in China, the Tamils in Sri Lanka, the Tutsi in Central Africa, the Chiapas Indians in Mexico, and so on."
"Kurdish illegal immigrants should have their cases dealt with under other criteria, rational and humanitarian criteria."
"The ethnic political criterion, with the individual exception of genuine victims of political persecution, like Leyla Zana or Wei Jing Sheng, must be dropped because it will lead to unforeseeable and uncontrollable developments."
"The European Union must press for an international political solution to the tragedy of the Kurds, and not fall back on the unsustainable principle of the guaranteed right of asylum but get the problem dealt with through the UN, starting with human rights violations by Turkey, Iraq and Iran."
"Sainjon report (A4-0392/97)"
"The Sainjon report provides quite a dull vision of relocation, perhaps because, from the start, its had chosen to stick to an overly limited definition of this issue: according to the report, relocation only takes place when a contractor - head of a company - deliberately decides to move production, by direct investment, subcontracting or trading, to a country where social costs are lower."
"This definition, which is too restrictive, could lead us to quibble indefinitely about a movement, the size of which we cannot calculating - and which we can also quote counter-examples of - but which is carefully interpreted to give the impression of a two-way movement."
"That is the maze into which the Sainjon report has wandered."
"In reality, if we stand back, we can see that the rise of unemployment in Europe is concomitant with international openness."
"Certainly some countries, such as the UK, manage to avoid it, by means of energetic liberal policies."
"That is in fact one way to proceed."
"But I must emphasize that the British success in combating unemployment - now 5 % - is certainly due in part to having attracted economic activities which were once carried out in neighbouring continental countries."
"In other words, the experiment would probably be less successful if France and Germany had also adopted the same policies."
"If we want an overview of the whole process of relocation, it should be given a wider definition: relocation takes place whenever the process of international competition results in the creation of a job in an emerging country, and destroys a job in our own."
"In our opinion, a healthy process should on the contrary, create a job in both places at once."
"When defined in this way, the relocation process shows its true character: we are opposing international competition which works on a distorted basis, as the countries of Europe, paralysed by false notions, are unable to establish even a slightly voluntarist policy in order to defend themselves."
"In the hope that, on the basis of its narrow definition, everything will develop spontaneously in the right direction, the Sainjon report therefore makes minimal proposals: a non-binding code of good practice for multinational companies, a confidence agreement between distributors, manufacturers and subcontractors; the creation of a global 'social label' by the ILO, etcetera."
"The proposal from the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations is simple and definite: we should decrease the benefits of relocation by decreasing the benefits of reimportations when they are harmful to us."
"For that reason, we must ask the next round of international commercial negotiations, due to start in 1999, to consider the fairness of international competition and the legitimacy of areas of regional preference if they are asked for democratically by the populations concerned."
"The report submitted to us overlooks the conflictive dimension of international economics and the effects of the domination of a large power which has an interest in unrestrained free trade."
"The real cause of relocation is this policy, whereby the costs of production and wages around the world are extremely heterogeneous."
"The report only superficially analyses the consequences of relocations on employment in Europe, and underestimates their negative effects."
"It also disregards the role of the tax and National Insurance contributions, which are too high in Europe and are an often-disregarded cause of relocations."
"The rapporteur pins his hopes on the signature of voluntary Codes of Conduct, which is obviously inadequate."
"It is therefore necessary to re-examine the question of relocations, from a point of view other than that of unilateral free trading."
"I shall therefore vote against this report."
"Every week, there are European firms that announce relocations, usually without notice, and without consulting trade unions."
"These relocations are based on competition between populations, and they speculate on social and wage differentials."
"There are also used by employers as a means of pressure and bribery so that they can apply pressure on employees and jobs."
"Such relocations often destroy jobs."
"In France, the three sectors most affected - the textiles, shoe and electronics industries, have lost half the number of their employees in 15 years."
"But other sectors are also affected, such as the car industry, and more and more service industries are being affected by relocations."
"Relocations are based on the logic of liberalization and deregulation within the framework of globalization."
"Instead of trying to combat and resist the damage caused by globalization, the European Union is contributing towards its reinforcement, by submitting to the dictatorship of the financial markets."
"Measures can and must be taken at the Community level, to counter the deregulation of financial markets and the volatility of investments which can be directed at any time towards profitable short term activities, to the detriment of the employees and economies of whole areas."
"The taxation of capital movements would make it possible to control and restrict them."
"The report by the Committee on External Economic Relations, which I approve, makes other proposals which could contribute towards reducing relocations, or which could at least prevent their most injurious consequences in terms of employment and purchasing power."
"I am pleased, from that point of view, that the report has adopted our group's amendments, on the one hand, with regard to the inclusion of social and environmental clauses in international agreements and in the WTO rules, and on the other hand, that the multilateral agreement on international investment currently being negotiated within the framework of the OECD should not hinder the right of States to monitor human rights and the environment with regard to multinational companies operating within their countries."
"In view of the seriousness of these issues, it is essential that we do more, that we demand that the multilateral agreement on international investment should recognize the cultural exception, so that culture is not considered a mere commodity subject to the laws of a market dominated by American firms."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted for the report by AndrÃ© Sainjon concerning the relocation of businesses and direct investments in third countries seen in the light of the globalization of trade, production and investment."
"The report calls on the Commission to draw up a code of conduct for multinational companies based on a number of social obligations."
"The code of conduct will be based on the following points:"
"the promotion of trade union freedom-combating forced labour-combating child labour-the elimination of discrimination in employment and careers, and equal pay for men and womenThe Danish Social Democrats are positive towards the proposal, because this proposal can contribute to a fairer labour market in third countries and ensure fair competition in a globalized economy."
"The report mentions that social harmonization should be speeded up."
"The Danish Social Democrats draw attention to the fact that social policy is a national concern."
"The proposals made by the Sainjon report are like putting a wooden leg in plaster."
"If you accept the globalization of the economy and total freedom of investment, if you engage the entire fabric of industrial production in an unbridled productivity race, if you persist in the belief that multinational firms are not stateless entities only interested in profit, if you are convinced that efficiency demands international division of work... you should not be surprised when firms adapt to the environment they find themselves in and react in their own interests."
"The 'social label' is a huge piece of hypocrisy, which aims to pacify the conscience of European consumers; the Code of Conduct for multinationals is a hoax, generalized freedom of movement of capital will be a source of regional problems, which will imperil the whole of a financial system which has become a global system, and as a consequence, all the economies in the world."
"The rapporteur writes, ' relocation is a logical economic development, which should not be approached from an ideological point of view' ."
"But why should we not look at it from an ideological point of view? We have reached this point, because you consider that economic development is an aim in itself."
"We believe that economic development is a means, which should serve the political aims of employment and the well being of the people, environmental protection, and the organization of society."
"We shall always oppose our human vision of the world, to your accountant's, mathematician's vision."
"The relocations are connected with the dynamics of the so-called globalization stemming from an increased mobility of factors."
"But this mobility does not maintain the same rates for the various factors and activities."
"Production is relocated at a speed conditioned by all the equipment and requirements of complex combinations, trade may benefit from greater facilities and speed of transport and financial capital benefits from changes that can be described as revolutionary in communications, in a legal framework of freedom of movement achieving licentious privileges."
"Consequently, at present, the so-called relocations are the result in particular of the spiralling circulation of capital, looking for places and situations where more and better are reproduced and accumulated, increasing their already disproportionate volume in relation to the requirements of the real economy in a disturbing way."
"Substantial production plant, unemployment and deteriorated social situations may remain, abandoned or transferred under insecure conditions and/or under used."
"This is a characterization which, unfortunately, is not a caricature and this report deals with this question by analysing what it calls the ""foreign investment' and a division of relocations into offensives (connected with direct investment), defensives (connected mainly with subcontracting) and those of ""international business' (connected with the dynamics of transnational groups)."
"It seems to us, however, that this concept of foreign investment has different contours and content from those they began by defining."
"With the relocations, an investment somewhere may, as is happening more and more often, correspond to a disinvestment somewhere else."
"And it is very positive that the report should indicate (or reveal) the possible bad effects of the relocations, and point out four factors with a social basis that need to be introduced into this problem (trade-union organization and joint negotiation, prohibition of forced labour and child labour, and equal treatment), corresponding to minimum social clauses and to the appreciation of the role of the ILO, as the UN agency which the WTO, in the ultra-liberal drift that gave rise to them, has sought to level and cause to ignore."
"Although we are expecting little from the recommendations on codes of good conduct for transnationals, the statement/report of this characterization of the relocations and foreign investment is positive."
"As the content of the Sainjon report has remained unchanged, as far as the diagnosis and treatment of relocation is concerned, we were unable to vote in favour."
"It reflects an analysis of the problem that is more and more disputed by economists."
"And the measures, mostly optional, which it envisages to remedy the negative effects of relocation do not seem equal to the economic and social problems generated in our countries by a procedure closely connected with the whole-hearted adoption of the principle of free trading."
"We have seen that, in order to really measure the consequences of relocation in our countries, it essential for the approach to the question to be much wider than the rapporteur's."
"It is also necessary to avoid giving an impression that everything balances out and that there is a similar movement in both directions, by mentioning a few cases which have taken place in the opposite direction, but which are not representative of the main trend."
"Thus, the highly publicised relocation of Toyota to Valenciennes seems rather like a chance event, or a temporary relocation, whereas most Asian companies which did relocate to Europe are, now that European markets have become much more open, tending to repatriate their establishments and to use traditional export procedures, rather than maintain production in Europe."
"The process of relocation is in reality fundamentally unilateral."
"Corrective measures must therefore be closely suited to it."
"It is strange that the only regulatory policy the rapporteur will not envisage is the policy which would best protect European labour-intensive industries flexibly against unfair competition, and which our partners know how to use: import quota measures."
"When forced to use them, the Commission regrettably tends to make them inoperative, by implementing a policy of derogation to the full, as we have seen in the car industry."
"Mr Sainjon does not unfortunately propose to correct the present incoherence, as he suggests at one and the same time, that the Community programme ECIP should be developed, which acts as an incentive to relocations, and that structural funds should in the future focus on the areas most affected by relocations, which would mean subsidizing both relocations and the damage done by relocations."
"It would certainly be more appropriate to consider how to make it less attractive to re-import, which destroys so many jobs in our countries."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 12.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I must report a very serious matter currently occurring in Italy."
"After betraying the legitimate expectations of the breeders, the Italian Government is using police methods and repression to damage and harm them, and at this moment, hundreds of breeders are being arrested and having their tractors and any other working equipment seized."
"We are indignant and call on the European Parliament to show solidarity."
"We want to tell Parliament that falsifying the balance sheet is not sufficient to join the single currency..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Alpine transit (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on Alpine transit."
"Mr President, since the failure of Switzerland to join the European Economic Area, negotiations between the European Union and Switzerland have covered various sectors."
"So it is important to achieve balanced results both in the negotiations overall and for the individual sectors involved."
"Five important negotiations have been concluded successfully and every effort is needed to reach an agreement in the transport sector too."
"The Italian Government is strongly committed to reaching a balanced agreement."
"The long term objective of a progressive transfer of traffic from road to rail is supported and in this sense the financial commitment of the Swiss government is much appreciated, just as we share the Swiss concerns about the environment - and Parliament has made its views known on that point many times."
"But I think some precise definitions are needed in the negotiations overall."
"The Italian economic interests involved in the discussion should not be prejudiced as compared with the current situation."
"It is not just the cost to the hauliers that is under discussion but the competitiveness of Italian products on the European market, since taxation issues cannot be introduced and hauliers are burdened with external costs before these are precisely defined at Community level."
"So we need to take a position on toll systems which brings them into line with Community arrangements and correlates them with the implicit cost of the infrastructure used and its management and maintenance."
"Furthermore, while it is necessary and important to pay attention to the environmental problems, and the European Parliament is particularly sensitive to them and has frequently debated them, it has to be recognized that moving the traffic to rail in a short time is illusory, because the necessary infrastructure is not there."
"So the planned infrastructure solutions must be speeded up as much as possible and to this end the Government of Swiss Confederation should be asked, in the negotiations, to move in that direction."
"Then there is something Switzerland does not mention, and that is its interest in air traffic."
"Now if we want to find solutions to the problems, all the interests need to be put on the table so that we have the full picture and can deal with everything."
"To conclude, the agreement currently in force expires in 2004."
"So we have time to deal with the problems, although personally I think we should try to do it sooner, and find a balanced agreement which takes account of all the aspects and above all provides reciprocity of understanding between the respective regions."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we are talking about transit today, we are, of course, also going to be talking about the fact that for 40 years in Europe we have supported a common market and that we have therefore always promoted a society based on the principle of the division of labour."
"Today we find ourselves in a position where two out of our four major routes through the Alps run through Switzerland and we cannot therefore accept the creation of an artificial barrier which would burden the other two routes, our friends in the Brenner - Mr Voggenhuber, you were quick to pick up on your cue there - with additional traffic."
"The European Union has always supported the principle of the shortest route and that means that we need the appropriate transit routes through Switzerland."
"In terms of the Alps in general, we have a set of very different rules."
"In Austria 40 tonnes, but an eco-point system, in Switzerland a 28 tonne limit and bans on night driving. That does not constitute the uniform policy which we, as the PPE, are calling for and expect from the Commission."
"However, we also expect an alpine traffic policy to be based on a set of uniform rules applicable throughout Europe rather than the methods of highway robbery and the robber barons."
"I have already mentioned the principle of the shortest route, which must has to be taken into account."
"There is also the question of the environment."
"No one can tell me that long diversions are better for the environment."
"And no one can tell me that rail can be made more competitive by artificially making roads more expensive."
"On Monday we had the Sarlis Report on the revitalization of the railways."
"The railways also have to get into shape so that they can compete with the roads."
"This will not happen simply by making lorries more expensive."
"In this spirit, I call upon the Commission to continue its negotiations with Switzerland."
"I hope that the matter will be brought to a close under this British Presidency."
"Mr President, in the European Union there is a strange obsession with the idea that everything should be harmonized, regardless of geographic, environmental or climatic differences."
"That is why people do not want to recognise the difference between heavy traffic through Alpine valleys and the same heavy traffic on the plains of Flanders."
"But it should be obvious, just as obvious as the fact that you cannot have the same traffic noise in a residential area as on a through road or drive at the same speed in town as you can on a motorway."
"The European Union is also suffering from another obsession, that of wanting to control and dictate the internal policies and relations of other countries, and wanting to force them to accept bad regulatory systems which belong in the Union."
"Switzerland is a free and sovereign State."
"Switzerland is neither a member of the Union nor the EEA, the European Economic Area ."
"If Switzerland wants to take care of its citizens' environment, that is a Swiss matter."
"To subject a country to pressure to make it take a step backwards in its environmental policy is highly objectionable."
"Instead the Union should see Switzerland as an example of environmental and traffic policy, because Switzerland is taking the path which we will all have to take eventually if we are to save the environment in our part of the world."
"The fact that Switzerland is advanced in this area and is ahead of the European Union is due in part to the fact that Switzerland is a real democracy where the citizens' awareness of environmental policy can be expressed."
"The Union, on the other hand, with its closed institutions, is far too easily influenced, at least in its current form, by internal lobbying on behalf of interests like those represented by road traffic."
"That is why the Union currently has an immature position on many important environmental issues."
"It is high time that people took a different level of responsibility, both within the Union and in attitudes to other, more advanced countries, countries where the sacred market does not have the same paramount position as it has unfortunately been given in this Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for my country the transit agreement between Austria and the EU was a central prerequisite for entry into the EU."
"The people of Austria attached great hopes to this agreement. Hopes of an end to ecological destruction."
"Hopes of an end to health damage caused by excessively high noise and air emissions. But, encouraged by the Austrian government, the Austrian people also hoped that this agreement might lead to a rethink on ecological issues in the European Union, that this agreement might provide the trigger for a new, sustained traffic policy."
"Just a few years later we have come to realise that in hoping these hopes millions of people in our country failed to reckon with the Commission."
"Millions of Swiss have done the same and voted to changed their law in a referendum."
"These two countries represent models of modern traffic policy, not obstacles to it. The Commission on the other hand is not a model of modern traffic policy in Europe, but an obstacle."
"It is still entangled in the interests of the transport lobby."
"It remains fixed on the idea of an uncontrolled division of labour across borders into which it has failed to factor the costs in terms of either health or ecology of this traffic madness."
"Mr Ferber has now left the room."
"If he were still here I would have explained the basics of this problem to him once and for all."
"For the Alps are not an artificial barrier which some environmentalist or politician in his foolishness has planted in the midst of the internal market, but a natural barrier in a highly sensitive ecological region."
"At the time the Commission promised much in its negotiations on transit traffic."
"None, I repeat none, of which has been realised to date."
"The Commission is taking legal action against Austria over the level of its toll charges, although they comply with the Commission's Green Paper."
"It is delaying recognition of the inclusion of external costs."
"It has made no attempt to implement the Alps Convention. What we see here is the almost pseudo-religious worshipping of an internal market without regard to the human principles of life and health."
"Mr President, this debate is proceeding in our language, as might well have been expected, given that it is an issue that is particularly close to our hearts."
"It therefore amazes me - while I welcome the presence of Commissioner van den Broek - that after having had over two days of the assiduous presence of Commissioner Kinnock while the British Government was here - and I regard the Commission with friendship, take note - at the very moment when an issue falling within the specific competence of Commissioner Kinnock is being discussed, we have instead the authoritative presence of Commissioner van den Broek."
"I cannot but emphasize the concern we feel at the slow pace of this agreement, the secret, opaque way we are kept informed, and the way in which this agreement more or less reverberates across the Alpine problem as a whole."
"How can I understand - and we are trying to understand it better through this debate - that the agreement is still something to come and therefore the traffic can only find outlets in other areas, on other routes of communication like the very important one which links the Val d'Aosta with France and which is at risk, if things carry on this way, of gridlock and calls for doubling the width of the Mont Blanc motorway which would be catastrophic for the countries, the valleys and the citizens who inhabit the regions the motorway must cross."
"I hope the large groups will accept the amendments tabled by the group of the European Radical Alliance and thus take the opportunity - in this debate on the problem of Alpine transit, as we have defined it, but not agreed with Switzerland - to insert two or three paragraphs which broaden the context and highlight the need for combined transport rather than taking a mere sectoral view of the problem."
"Mr President, the free movement of goods, services and people is of enormous economic importance to the European Union."
"Its policy therefore aims to remove obstacles to traffic, both by lifting administrative impediments at borders, and by building a new infrastructure, the Trans European Networks."
"The fact that this policy has been effective is obvious from the large growth in freight transport, in particular on the road."
"The problem of Alpine transit traffic illustrates that there are also limits to this free movement of goods."
"The ecologically extremely vulnerable Alpine region shows more quickly than elsewhere that the environment's ability to cope is limited."
"It is partly for this reason that Austria has multiplied the charges for the Brenner Tunnel, that there are protests in France against road building at the Mont Blanc, and that the people of Switzerland declared in the Alpine Referendum of 1994 that all freight will have to pass through the region by train."
"Austria, meanwhile, finds that membership of the EU does not only entail benefits."
"The country has been summoned before the Court of Justice for increasing toll charges on the Brenner."
"Fortunately, European politicians are not blind to the environmental damage resulting from road transport."
"The by now famous Green Paper 'Towards Fair and Efficient Pricing in Road Transport' makes it clear that the 'external' factors around transport have to be included in the price."
"The review of the Euro-sticker mentions the so-called 'sensitive' routes."
"On these routes extra levies are allowed, to reduce air pollution, for instance."
"According to a report in Agence Europe of 12 December the Union does not want to allow Switzerland to apply similar principles as yet."
"Commissioner Kinnock and the Luxembourg Minister of Transport Mrs Delvaux afterwards said to the Transport Council that future Swiss tolls must be based directly on the costs of the existing infrastructure."
"The costs of the new infrastructure, let alone external costs, are not to be included."
"I ask Commissioner van de Broek whether the said report is correct."
"In that case I would like him to tell me to what extent these statements are compatible with the Green Paper, and the recent proposals for the Euro-sticker."
"Finally, does the Commissioner share my conviction that the free movement of goods, too, must respect the limits set by the environment?"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the starting point for our discussion are the negotiations with Switzerland."
"Switzerland has taken the view that by not joining the European Union it can remain in a sort of happy isolation."
"Switzerland can see that it is in an isolated position."
"However, I would like to reject most adamantly part of what has been said here today - by Mr Ferber and previously - and that is that this is the behaviour of robber barons, of highway robbers."
"As has already been said, Switzerland has a very specific, highly comprehensible traffic and environmental policy."
"However, Switzerland must also fit into the overall European picture."
"There's no way around it."
"Secondly: Obviously the basic characteristics of the landscape are a given."
"It may be the case that other landscapes are worth protecting."
"But that shouldn't stop us giving special protection to this special landscape and to the special situation of the populations in the narrow valleys, whether they be in Switzerland, Austria, France or Italy,"
"Thirdly: The European Union has a set of traffic policy principles."
"Some speakers appear to have forgotten this."
"I would reject absolutely accepting the principle of the shortest route, which I otherwise support, without mentioning that there are also other principles, that we have environmentally friendly and environment-oriented traffic, that it is indeed a matter of external costs."
"It is not that we want to pass the external costs on to lorries without justification, but rather that the external costs only arose in the first place due to the excessive number of lorries."
"The step-by-step transfer of traffic from road to rail is the founding principle of European traffic policy."
"And in the interests of our environment and our population we must deviate not from it."
"However, we must understand that, as a result, we need to find a way of incorporating Switzerland into an overall concept, that the diverting of traffic which is currently taking place - and represents some 30 % to 40 % of the traffic in my home country of Austria, especially in the Tirol - where it still exists and has not already been transferred to rail, must be stopped."
"Our goal must obviously be a general reduction in the level of traffic on the roads."
"But this goal cannot be achieved by simply blocking off one country and diverting the traffic into others."
"In Europe, at the end of this century, it must surely be possible to create a genuinely common traffic policy."
"So, where are the policies which the Commission, the Parliament and the Council should be following?"
"I should also say that I would not lay all the blame at the door of the Commission."
"The Parliament too was very circumspect in making it last resolutions and in general terms agrees completely with what Commissioner Kinnock said."
"There are certain countries which are represented in the Council and exert more resistance there."
"Firstly: The aim must be, step-by-step, to reintegrate Switzerland into an all-European traffic policy shaped by the EU, and to do this as quickly as possible!"
"Secondly: No traffic should be diverted."
"Thirdly: Wherever necessary diverted traffic must be returned to original routes."
"Fourthly: No single country in the EU should be placed in a worse position than Switzerland in terms of the levying of charges, tolls, etc."
"We accept the fact that charges have to be levied, that there is place for the toll and that it fulfils a control function. But it must be clear that a country outside the EU cannot be afforded more opportunities than the countries within the EU."
"If these principles are observed it must surely be possible to create a reasonable European traffic policy and to use the instruments available, including the toll, to create an environment- and therefore people-oriented traffic policy for the whole of Europe."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to express my pleasure that Switzerland is moving ever closer to the European Union and that the European Union is making every effort to move this country at the very heart of Europe closer to Europe."
"However, we must all share the same rights and the same duties."
"I believe that there should be one agreement, not a number of different agreements."
"The Alps are, without question, a sensitive area; that is something which is felt particularly by those who live there, like myself."
"Although transit is currently having a huge impact, one which we feel on a daily basis, it would be incomprehensible and unacceptable for the population living along the Brenner, whether in Trentino, the South Tirol or in Tirol Province, if Switzerland were to receive special treatment, leaving us worse off."
"Quite clearly, the aim of the policy is to protect a sensitive area - whether by toll or by positive support - by providing the sensitive zone with new opportunities such as the expansion of rail facilities or under-tunnelling."
"And no doubt there is still much negotiating to be done."
"In conclusion, the rapprochement between Switzerland and the European Union, whatever form it takes, is a positive factor, but it should be without privileges, affording the same rights for all."
"Again, there is no reason why privileges should be granted for a limited period."
"Mr President, the Greens are asking the EU and the Federal government in Germany to strongly support Switzerland's plans for the introduction of an output-related heavy goods vehicle tax and an alpine transit tax in order, at long last, to move forward on the protection of the alpine habitat and the transfer of heavy goods transport from road to rail."
"Similarly, external costs - in particular environmental costs - as well as road costs should be passed on to road traffic, taking into account the especially high costs in the alpine regions."
"For we have a particular responsibility to the people and their alpine habitat."
"It would appear the Messrs Jarzembowski and Ferber, in particular, have not quite grasped this point."
"We cannot, as they suggest, try to blackmail Switzerland with the argument that if they don't do what the EU wants them to do, the Swiss will no longer be allowed out of their own country, that they will, so to speak, be imprisoned in their own fortress."
"Let me say once and for all and quite clearly, this behaviour is nothing but more imperialist delusions and status craving."
"In actual fact, Switzerland's plans support the EU in as far as they are an attempt, at long last, to develop a sustained traffic policy."
"That can hardly be described as an attack on the EU! Against this backdrop, the blockade being operated by Bavaria, the Federal government and the Italians is quite incomprehensible."
"The Greens are organizing a conference on this complex question with the representatives of the various countries involved on 1st February in Lindau."
"Turning to the Netherlands: If the alpine habitat is destroyed, it won't be the sea that you will need to build your flood dams against, it will be Rhine."
"For once the Alps are destroyed, you'll find yourselves under water all year long!"
"The Alps provide a reservoir of potable water; one which we need."
"If we continue to destroy the Alps in this manner, it may well be possible to ski everywhere in the Alps, because there won't be any trees."
"But if that's the point, why not go skating in Holland instead!"
"I advise you to take a completely fresh look at this habitat, and as a farmer, I say to you: We live off 30 cm of this earth, and if these 30 cm are destroyed then we quite simply won't have to worry about free trade, transit and goods transport any more."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, anyone looking for long-term progress in traffic policy in the Alps today will swiftly come to the conclusion that in Europe everyday is soap-box day."
"For the number of soap-box speeches to be heard demanding a common, transnational, environment- and people-oriented traffic policy is large and they all promise great things. However, not much is actually being done."
"We are simply trying to stop things happening."
"Listening to the discussions and the Commissioner's information today, I have to conclude that nothing concrete is coming of today's debate either."
"None of these speeches and statements actually represent a step forwards."
"In fact, here in the European Parliament - this is a European Community - soap-boxes are making a great comeback."
"What we have heard so far today is the German MEPs who have spoken taking part in a competition to find the most stupid soap-box orator..This is not way to construct Europe."
"No way to make progress."
"The EU Commission should see itself as the engine of the Community's traffic policy."
"Laying out the external costs of traffic is indeed highly commendable."
"Drawing up an Alps Clause with the European Parliament is indeed progress. But the Commission doesn't have the courage to implement these ideas, to get anything concrete off the ground."
"That is why the EU Commission and the presidency of the Council of Europe are being asked to do something about the situation."
"That's why they are being asked to do something in the heart of Europe, in the foothills of the Alps in southern Germany."
"And here I also include the Austrian areas."
"At the present time the situation is such that most of the accent is being placed on the Munich-Verona route where an impossibly expensive, 20 km long mega tunnel is being proposed."
"Unfortunately, we know that the completion date of this much needed project will be a long time coming."
"What we must do now is involve the Court of Auditors and, at long last, start to operate a reasonable policy which the people, the economy and also the environmentalists in Europe can understand."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the north-south link through the Brenner is one of the most important routes for road haulage."
"The impact suffered by Austria as a result is enormous."
"Disproportionately so, in comparison to Switzerland."
"Some 30 % more lorries travel through the Brenner than through the Swiss passes."
"Many haulage contractors choose the longer routes through the Brenner because they are more financially viable."
"This way of thinking on the part of the hauliers must be stopped and the cost advantage involved in using the Brenner must be removed."
"The diverted traffic must return to its original route."
"In a verbal supplementary amendment we, together with our Austrian colleagues in the Social Democratic Party, are therefore asking the Commission to ensure that in matters of alpine transit no EU Member State is placed in a worse position than Switzerland."
"This unfair burden must also be stopped to protect the populations involved."
"In order to remove the financial advantage which exists on the Brenner route a common charging system should be introduced for Austria, Switzerland and France."
"Lowering the charges in the Brenner, which are already lower than those in Switzerland, sends out the wrong signal and will not help to shift heavy goods traffic to the Swiss routes."
"If the burden of charges placed on the haulage contractor were the same on all the routes over the main ridge of the Alps there would be a chance that routes other than the one through the Brenner would be chosen."
"For this reason, in its negotiations with the Swiss, the Commission should work towards balancing these charges and securing the admittance of 40 tonne lorries."
"The Commission must not shy away from its responsibility to the Member States and to the population, especially in regard to such a sensitive region as the main ridge of the Alps."
"Mr President, following on from my contribution during the first part, perhaps I can respond to a few of the speeches made by the honourable Members."
"First of all, concerning the Brenner, which seem to raise some questions."
"Firstly, whether Austria should simply be allowed to maintain these higher tolls on the Brenner motorway."
"It is generally known that negotiations are still taking place to see whether agreement can be reached with the parties to find a solution on the basis of the so-called Alpine Clause."
"If this fails, obviously the Commission will feel obliged to await the verdict of the Court, before whom the case is at present, as you know."
"But we would much prefer an agreement between the parties concerned, and we will continue to work towards this."
"The next matter, Mr President, the comments which have been made regarding the inclusion of external costs or not."
"Let it be clear that at the moment the Commission must base itself on the community law which only allows inclusion of part of the external costs, not the total."
"As far as that is concerned we should therefore say that we are acting on the basis of the existing community law, and not on the basis of what the Commission would like to see; which is broader, as is also evident from what the Commission has said about it in the Green Paper."
"Finally, Mr President, on the subject of charging for transit transport."
"As I mentioned to begin with, we do not yet fully agree on the figures."
"One of the most important points is the level of the tariffs which will applied from the 1st of January 2005."
"As we are still in negotiation I am sure this Parliament will understand that I cannot give any further specific details about the strategies pursued by us."
"This Parliament will get the opportunity to give its opinion when it is consulted on the Union's decision regarding ratification of the agreement."
"For that matter I pointed out, and I am being unanimously supported by the Council, that the levy presently proposed by Switzerland, is still not acceptable."
"We are talking about sums of 410 Swiss francs for a 40 tonne lorry travelling from between Basel to Chiasso. But in view of the fact that Switzerland has indicated that it wishes to take up a flexible position, I trust that we will be able to reach agreement in due course."
"To comfort Mr Dell'Alba, who is surprised not to see Mr Kinnock behind this table, let me say to him that it is not possible for the Commission to organize its work in such a way that all questions posed to this Parliament are answered by the Commissioner under whose authority this falls."
"But the comforting phrase I wanted to utter is that this Commissioner is responsible within the Commission for the relations with Switzerland."
"I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Community aid"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0388/97 by Mr Goerens, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on improving the effectiveness of Community aid; -A4-0391/97 by Mr Fabra VallÃ©s, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on Special Report No 2/97 by the Court of Auditors on the humanitarian aid of the European Union (1992-1995) (C4-0219/97)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we now have an opportunity finally to end this House's debate on improving the efficiency of development aid."
"To discuss development is to discuss one of the noblest tasks."
"However, that does not enable us to dispense with certain elementary principles and rules."
"I refer, in particular, to the need to ensure that Community aid and the aid provided by Member States are complementary."
"Various players are involved in development, and everything possible must be done to avoid duplication."
"Inadequate coordination or even a total lack of coordination between the various players in the field will inevitably lead to negative effects."
"Better coordination involving all the players involved in development, good internal coherence between the various instruments of development policy, and better visibility, are certainly not aims in themselves, but they are means to ensure that more citizens of Europe accept the idea of the need to continue to ensure cooperation between the European Union and developing countries."
"That is particularly important at the moment, when we are observing a decrease in development aid, a trend to which we should not be indifferent, under any circumstances."
"This should therefore be put right."
"That is what this report is trying to do, by first of all, raising the question of instruments, measures, and the question of efficiency criteria relating to development aid."
"Development aid is efficient compared with what?"
"The Development Assistance Committee of the OECD provides a more or less satisfactory answer to this, by proposing to use as development aid evaluation criteria, pertinence, efficiency, impact of the development and durability."
"Pertinence is a result of reflecting on the problems to be solved and the aims of a programme."
"The search for efficiency is reflected in the ability to achieve those aims at the lowest cost."
"Efficiency is measured in relation to the expected result and the situation of the beneficiaries, and also in terms of unexpected results or negative effects."
"The impact of a development programme must relate to the medium term and well as the long term."
"Finally, the last criterion relates to the durability and sustainability of the development undertaken."
"Mr President, all the evaluations of development programmes to which my written report refers show some interesting trends, and in particular, I will quote three examples - the small but positive impact of European Commission development aid on the economic growth of receiving countries, the increase in the average life expectancy resulting from improved health indicators, which is appreciable, and thirdly, the not very durable nature of a large number of development programmes."
"This list is not exhaustive, but I have selected some examples, which adequately illustrate the need to continue the evaluation work."
"Another lesson to be drawn from the evaluation is that microanalysis, project by project, is useful, inasmuch as it highlights exemplary achievements funded by the European Community."
"I am obliged to note however, that the approach to evaluation by sector is more reliable, as it provides a more global appreciation of the efficiency of the development or otherwise."
"It also seems sensible to me to consider another aspect: is there a vision of development specific to Europe?"
"If so, what is it?"
"The measures in favour of human rights and democracy already undertaken by the Commission, not only send European development policy in the right direction, they also to some extent raise the question of conditional aid."
"Indeed, the correct management of public affairs and development does not escape this rule."
"It is to a very great extent dependent on the nature of the political system in place, on the honesty and quality of the local authorities, on the level of democratic activity within the local population and on the quality of the policies adopted."
"Mr President, I will spare you the details."
"Furthermore, the Members of this House who are going to speak have no doubt read my report, which is not disputed, inasmuch as I have not seen any amendments."
"I do not wish to end without listing various conclusions that seem important to me."
"There are six of these."
"First of all, we have asked for the European Development Fund to come within the scope of the EU budget, which is one of this Parliament's previous demands, and which is likely to considerably improve the visibility of European policy on this subject."
"Secondly, we consider it essential that lessons are drawn from evaluations, in order to influence future programmes."
"Thirdly, the Commission does not have enough human resources to handle and manage the administration of cooperation projects."
"This must be put right."
"Fourthly, the crucial role of women in developing countries must finally be recognized."
"Within the framework of development programmes in particular, the role of women is essential, if only because of the positive influence of women with regard to birth control."
"Fifthly, the intensification of the dialogue with NGOs is indispensable."
"Mr Fabra, I believe, will have more to say on that point."
"We have discussed the suitability of setting up a development agency at length."
"We are not yet ready to do so."
"During the debate with the Commission, it was considered appropriate to move forward to an intermediate stage."
"I refer to this in my written report, and I believe that the compromise we have found is a good compromise."
"It will enable us to prepare even more substantial projects with regard to evaluation, which seems indispensable to me, and is the very essence of this report."
"Mr President, before anything else I would like to stress that when we talk of ECHO we are talking about a very young organization, which in a very short time has managed to forge an excellent reputation."
"ECHO was created in 1992, therefore it can only call upon five years of experience."
"Since it began ECHO has faced up to considerable problems: the war in Yugoslavia, Rwanda, the refugees in northern Iraq and here I am only giving three examples which have required outstanding efforts and without ECHO being allowed to enjoy a long apprenticeship period."
"In its special report, the Court of Auditors confirms that the outcome has been successful."
"ECHO, in the first five years of its existence, has acquired an important wealth of experience which ensures that it will be in the forefront amongst international organizations dedicated to the question of humanitarian aid."
"Similarly, that front line role is confirmed by the facts and figures: in 1996, the rate of participation in ECHO was higher than 20 % of the total of the world's humanitarian aid."
"If we add to this percentage the efforts of the Member States we confirm that the European Union is, outstandingly, the highest donor in the world."
"The European Union has provided about half of the world's humanitarian aid, more than ECU 1.6 billion in 1996."
"Unfortunately these endeavours are carried out in a diverse way."
"The Court of Auditors has confirmed that, quite simply, there is a lack of coordination and cooperation between the Community and its Member States, as well as between the Member States themselves."
"The result is that the Union and its Member States often waste their energy and cannot pull their weight as they might, and ought to, do."
"It is in this context in which the proposal from the Court of Auditors, for a charter regarding humanitarian aid, has acquired its full importance."
"Such a charter might be useful to stimulate a debate about the need for cooperation between the Community and its Member States, as well as about the principles which ought to govern such cooperation."
"All this is urgent and necessary since the Treaty of Amsterdam makes no reference to humanitarian aid, which means at the moment there is a lack of a true foundation document."
"I must add that the way to arrive at such a charter as well as the subsequent debate will show, would be as important as the result."
"It would be a question of a process with which national parliaments should be intensively associated."
"For example, in the framework of an interparliamentary conference."
"In a much more general area, it is a question of being aware of the fact that humanitarian aid often takes place in complex, crisis situations."
"Those crises do not suddenly happen unexpectedly, as with natural catastrophes."
"Rather they have their origins in political, ethnic and economic tensions."
"As a reaction to these crises, rapid response aid, although greatly needed at the time, is not enough."
"In view of the existence of such crises only an integrated approach to coordinate political, economic, military and humanitarian measures can ensure success."
"A Charter for humanitarian aid might be the formula for a greater awareness about this phenomenon."
"For all of this, we hope that the Committee makes full use of its powers of initiative and propose as much to the Council, as well as to Parliament, the Charter which has already been referred to so many times."
"Allow me to point out that it is the Committee who can and must provide an important political lead."
"In the same way there are many other actions which, in addition, we expect from the Committee."
"And I will put forward, as I see it, the three most important."
"Firstly, the Committee in a progressive way should replace the aid system directed towards single and precise operations by an approach to a more long term strategy with a specific programme."
"To this end the services of the Committee ought to establish strategic relations with key partners - of course, the large NGOs and the United Nations itself - so as to jointly produce and put into operation a common global strategy for urgent, chronic and complex areas."
"I am referring, for example, to the situation in the Great Lake region of Africa."
"Secondly, about 45 % of the credit made available by ECHO is used by non-governmental organizations."
"The Accounts Court has made a study of credits as a function of national origin for these NGOs."
"The result of this study reveals that there are notable imbalances."
"The Committee should strive to rectify these imbalances since there are strong agreements with the NGOs in France and Belgium while these agreements should be made stronger with NGOs in Germany and Portugal, for example."
"Thirdly, the Committee needs to put into operation a central evaluation unit for its development programmes including ECHO, MEDA, Phare and Tacis."
"This unit should supervise the appropriate quality control as well as comparing results from internal assessment, being involved in improving the exchange of experiences, not only in the heart of the Committee but also with other institutes responsible for development aid."
"The key word given by the Court of Auditors in this context of evaluation is independence."
"For this independence to be real, and as a result to be credible, this evaluation unit should be placed outside the broad operational General Management."
"It is with some satisfaction that I conclude now, Mr President, by underlining that the Goerens report is asking for exactly the same as I am doing."
"I congratulate you, Mr Goerens, on your report and thank you for your support in the opinion I have expressed."
"What is clearly shown is that if the Development Committee and the Budgetary Control Committee met more often we would have a lot more to say."
"All this, of course, with the aid of the Accounts Tribunal's reports."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as the time allocated for urgent and topical debate starts at 4 p.m., I will call only two more Members and then we will adjourn this debate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Goerens on his report, and on his extremely balanced resolution in particular."
"The effectiveness of community development aid regrettably often leaves much to be desired."
"Because despite of years of aid from Western nations people in less-developed countries are not able to support themselves, and economic growth is minimal."
"In order to increase the effectiveness of development aid I believe changes are much needed on three fronts."
"The OECD has pointed out that the best aid for less-developed countries is education for women, not least because there is an inverse relationship between how highly women are educated and the birth rate."
"Therefore, colleagues, how can we stop the explosive population growth in these countries?"
"By educating women."
"A lower population growth is the only way to break through this vicious circle."
"That was the first point."
"My second point is that knowledge and information are also important for sustainable development."
"To create a supporting base in the country itself and amongst the population, local universities and national research centres need to be involved in the dissemination of technology and knowledge."
"Thirdly, investment in the private sector towards entrepreneurship, and especially in small and medium-sized enterprises, and a better development of the market mechanism are crucial to economic and social progress."
"In this context too, women should not be overlooked as potential entrepreneurs."
"I understand that international banks are cooperating on developing initiatives."
"I hope Europe will not fall behind."
"We will now adjourn the debate and resume it at 6 p.m."
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent matters of major importance."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0056/98 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, on the situation in Mexico; -B4-0057/98 by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, Mr Galeote Quecedo, Mr Soulier and Mrs Esteban MartÃ­n, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the killing of 46 indigenous peasants in the Mexican state of Chiapas; -B4-0066/98 by Mrs Karamanou, Mr Newens and Mr CabezÃ³n Alonso, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the situation in the state of Chiapas; -B4-0073/98 by Mr GonzÃ¡lez TriviÃ±o, Mr Novo Belenguer, Mr Hory and Mr Dell'Alba, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the situation in the state of Chiapas; -B4-0085/98 by Mr Carnero GonzÃ¡lez, Mr Wurtz, Mr Manisco, Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez, Mr Novo, Mrs Pailler, Mr Alavanos, Mr Svensson, Mr Ephremidis and Mr SeppÃ¤nen, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the situation in the state of Chiapas (Mexico); -B4-0095/98 by Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, Mr Tamino, Mr Ripa di Meana and Mr Orlando, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the situation in the state of Chiapas (Mexico)."
"Mr President, there are no half measures where human rights are concerned and, in the specific case of the right to life, which when you lose it you can never get it back, you know, Mr President, that moderation becomes a vice when it stands back."
"Therefore it is important that this Parliament - I said it on 24th of December, I repeated it on 6th of January in the Foreign Affairs Committee, I put it to my political group again afterwards, and today I will say it again before the full session - this Parliament has to speak up to condemn unreservedly this slaughter which has shaken public opinion throughout the world."
"As well as vehemently condemning this barbaric act and showing solidarity with the families of the victims, this Parliament should also condemn every form of human rights' violation and violence, regardless of who is responsible for such criminal acts."
"Mexico, under the mandate of President Zedillo, is today immersed in a complex and unfinished process of reform."
"Many things have changed in that country since the elections of the 6th of July last, but there are other things which have not changed so much: violence, insecurity and impunity."
"It is certain that the measures taken by the Government - in the case of the massacre at Acteal and the events in Ocosingo - are an attempt to restore confidence and the country's credibility, within the limits of the legal system and the rule of law, under which all subjects must be seen as equal, beginning with the Government and ending with the citizens."
"But this is not enough, Mr President, it is not enough to react, since the loss of life, of one single human life, is irreparable."
"These measures should not be considered exceptional as they serve as a model for normal behaviour in any legal system."
"Because when freedom is violated - which begins with respect for the right to life - justice must be applied strictly, Mr President, For that reason this Parliament, by means of the resolution, appeals to the Government - which has the prime duty of looking after its citizens - to mobilize all its forces to prevent such shameful and dreadful deeds being repeated."
"And it stresses again that dialogue and the eradication of violence, of all violence, form the best path - rather the only path - to reach a lasting solution to the conflict and a just and durable peace for everyone."
"Mr President, the violent death of 45 defenceless people, most of them women and children, in the Mexican town of Acteal on 22nd of December last, once again presented us with a Mexico which is showing its deepest divisions in the state of Chiapas, where a rich Mexico and a poor, unequal and disadvantaged Mexico live uncomfortably side by side."
"I condemn unreservedly such an extremely serious act and express my solidarity with the victims and their families."
"The real situation in Chiapas today needs to be analyzed rigorously and sincerely."
"We cannot dismiss what is happening in Chiapas with a simplistic analysis or with western standards because very serious errors may be made."
"Rejecting the use of violence as a political instrument, I would like President Zedillo and his Government to find a solution to the Chiapas conflict and to the political, economic, social and cultural causes which are behind this conflict. I would like the Republic's legal system to keep the investigation open until the facts have been fully clarified and to avoid these going unpunished; for the Mexican political parties to reach agreement on national policies and decide upon a common legal approach to native autonomy, as an important step towards implementing part of the San AndrÃ©s agreements; for the presence of paramilitary groups in Chiapas to be eliminated and the Zapatista insurgents integrated as a civil organization - sooner rather than later - in Mexican political life; and finally for the Committee, in collaboration with the Mexican federal authorities, to support urgent aid programmes for the Chiapan refugees."
"I acknowledge the role of the Mexican Army in disarming the paramilitary groups and its activity in the distribution of aid to refugees; but all their efforts should be increased so that there are no armed confrontations between the Mexican regular army and Zapatista insurgents."
"If this confrontation should unfortunately occur, its consequences would be unpredictable."
"Today what really matters is to save this delicate mosaic of solutions and the peace we want and should be building."
"Mexican society should see in the European Union not just an accusing finger, but instead a loyal ally working with it to avoid conflict."
"The resolution which we wish to adopt today represents a modest contribution to that alliance established for the purpose of sharing problems and solutions together."
"Mr President, when we tabled this resolution, there may still have been some doubt as to whether the Mexican authorities were responsible for the massacre at Acteal."
"There is now no longer any doubt."
"It has been proved that the local authorities at least were warned of the preparations for the massacre on 21 December, that they were advised of the involvement of members of the Institutional Revolutionary Party and the police in those preparations."
"Far from understanding the feeling generated by the massacre, a feeling that brought 100 000 demonstrators out onto the streets of Mexico, the Mexican authorities are continuing to carry out repression, and another young Indian woman has just been killed by the Police."
"That is why I believe that this House should take up this issue, and although many of us do not share the romantic fascination, which the archaic left-wing notions of the Zapatista movement have for some, this House should loudly condemn the Mexican authorities, and exhort them to finally open a debate on the many problems, particularly with regard to property, which they face in the state of Chiapas."
"Mr President, the appalling slaughter at Acteal and the previous events testify to the serious problems which the democratic transition in Mexico is going through."
"Also they provide evidence for the lack of respect for human rights in that country and, of course, the explosive situation in the state of Chiapas."
"Europe should contribute to making Mexico a democracy which fully respects human rights, and we have to demand this, above all else, from President Ernesto Zedillo and his government."
"We have to ask the Mexican authorities to detain and find guilty those who are to blame for the slaughter at Acteal; to disarm the paramilitary groups who, as has already been noted, were working in Chiapas before the crime in Acteal, and to discourage them; to cease military operations in Chiapas and to withdraw the Army; to fulfil the San AndrÃ©s agreement and set up a real dialogue with the Zapatista Army; to respect human rights and to extend the democratic process as far as possible."
"Such a democratic process showed a marked improvement with the fair election of CuahutÃ©moc CÃ¡rdenas as governor of the Federal District capital."
"There is no doubt that we should agree with what the majority of Mexicans are asking for - and thousands and thousands have just done so on the streets of their cities - as well as with what most Europeans want too."
"Our citizens do not want vague promises about Mexico, they want clarity."
"We have to demand the same clarity here for Parliament, for the Council and for the Committee, and we have to ask for an international agreement in respect of human rights in Mexico and for the Committee to inform us about this issue in a regular and organized way."
"For all these reasons, good words are not enough; words have to be based on deeds and if we want all these demands to be met we have to use the means at our disposal."
"This is the reason why our resolution calls upon this Parliament to suspend the procedure for ratification of the bilateral agreement concluded last December between the European Union and Mexico, until President Zedillo meets the demands which were expressed before, and I think that we ought to ask national parliaments to take similar action."
"Mr President, the callous slaughter of 45 people at Acteal in the state of Chiapas in Mexico shocked human rights workers round the world."
"This resolution reflects a widely held sense of outrage."
"The prompt condemnation of the massacre by the Mexican President and the steps taken to root out those responsible and bring them to justice, as the resolution states, is welcome."
"But the Mexican authorities must recognize that any failure of the system which allowed the guilty to evade judgement would gravely damage their reputation."
"In the past Mexicans have suffered grievous violations of their human rights without the culprits being detected or punished."
"But it is vital on this occasion that those who committed so appalling a crime should not be allowed to avoid the consequences of their acts."
"The Government of Mexico must, furthermore, reiterate its declared commitment to a peaceful resolution to the conflict with the ZNLA."
"We must strongly urge both sides to renew their efforts to ensure that the objectives of the San AndrÃ©s agreements are achieved in full, without any further injuries or loss of life and, to this end, to meet with a will to succeed, come what may."
"If the terrible events of 22 December jolt those in a position of responsibility to take the actions required, not only to resolve the conflict, but also to tackle the underlying problems of poverty, deprivation and discrimination which lie behind the Zapatista revolt, the victims of Acteal will not have died in vain."
"At this stage I do not think that we should seek to impede the EU-Mexico agreement of December 1997 which includes the issue of human rights since the Mexican Government is taking action on the issues of this massacre."
"Inevitably, however, if human rights violations were to increase or fail to be dealt with, it would not be possible to oppose a much tougher line in future."
"Mr President, as I have been to Chiapas, and maintained regular contact, both with militant Zapatistas and many Mexican progressives, I can bear witness to the hope engendered, in Mexico, by the San AndrÃ©s agreements of February 1996."
"The culture of indigenous peoples should be recognized as an integral part of the diversity of Mexico, and their participation in its political life should be guaranteed."
"It is my conviction that basically the non-respect of these agreements was the main cause of the dramatic worsening of the situation in the state of Chiapas."
"Now, the worst has happened, and in the massacre at Acteal 45 people died on 22 December 1996."
"This is a serious indictment of those who, at the head of the State, tolerate such paramilitary groups and what is more, of the local leaders of the IRP who give these murderers their direct support."
"It is impossible to deny that the leaders of the country deliberately allowed the situation to worsen in order to try and isolate the Zapatistas or force them to make a mistake, in order to justify their adoption of the military option."
"It is within this context that I wish to pass on the express request of many important people in Chiapas and in Mexico in general, that is, that the partnership and cooperation agreement signed on 8 December 1997 between the European Union and Mexico, should be suspended, until the Mexican authorities dissolve these paramilitary groups, condemn the murderers, withdraw the Mexican army from the indigenous areas, and more generally, fulfil their commitments, or in other words, implement the San AndrÃ©s agreement, so that the populations of the state of Chiapas may at last achieve peace, justice and democracy."
"Mr President, the European Commission naturally shares the horror and dismay about the murder of 45 people in the village of Acteal in the Mexican state of Chiapas."
"This means that the hope for a peaceful solution to the conflict in Chiapas has further decreased, but cannot take this lying down, we of course."
"On the 22nd of December, in a statement from the Luxembourg Presidency, the European Commission called on the Mexican authorities to immediately set up an investigation into the identity of the perpetrators of the murders and to bring them to court."
"The European Union also pointed out that in the agreements between the European Union and Mexico, signed in Brussels on 8 December, both parties undertook to observe human rights and democratic principles unconditionally."
"The Commission has meanwhile taken note of President Zedillo's promise to employ all necessary resources at federal level to find and punish the perpetrators, and to intensify the talks on finding a peaceful solution to the conflict."
"This promise has been fulfilled."
"The Home Affairs Minister has resigned."
"The governor has mandated the Attorney General to lead the investigation personally."
"The governor of the state of Chiapas has been removed from office, and a number of people who are suspected of being involved in the murders have been arrested."
"The Commission has argued before and continues to argue for a peaceful solution which will have to be the result of mutual consultation between the government and the ZNLA."
"We will obviously continue to follow the developments in Chiapas closely."
"Our delegation in Mexico continues to report all developments and is in regular contract will all parties concerned."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0033/98 by Mr Bertens on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, on controls on armaments exports; -B4-0058/98 by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the European code of conduct on armaments exports; -B4-0064/98 by Mr Titley, Mr Swoboda and Mr Wiersma, on behalf of the PSE, on the European code of conduct on armaments exports; -B4-0081/98 by Mrs LalumiÃ¨re, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the code of conduct on armaments exports; -B4-0086/98 by Mr Wurtz, Mr JovÃ© Peres, Mr Alavanos, Mr Ribeiro and Mr Papayannakis, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on controls on armaments exports; -B4-0104/98 by Mrs Hautala, Mr TelkÃ¤mper, Ms Mckenna, Mr Gahrton and Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the European code of conduct on transfers of armaments."
"Thank you, Mr President. The Socialist Group warmly welcomes the initiative taken by the British Presidency to seek to establish a code of conduct on arms exports."
"We believe this is essential to the future because, of course, you cannot really have a common foreign and security policy dedicated to crisis management and conflict prevention, while at the same time your big companies are arming the very countries responsible for instability."
"It is also essential for the defence industry itself, because the lack of a code of conduct is holding back the consolidation which the industry needs and which will make it less dependent on exports, as I pointed out in my report to this Parliament a few months ago."
"In this debate we must not let the best be the enemy of the good."
"We should concentrate on two essential principles."
"Firstly, we need clear and commonly agreed principles governing the trade."
"That would mean distinguishing between the sale of arms to countries that would use them to abuse human rights and the sale of arms to countries that may have a dubious record but, nonetheless, have a legitimate external security concern."
"Unfortunately, the resolutions before us do not make sufficient distinction between these two issues."
"The second issue we have to address is that there should be no undercutting."
"Once a country decides on the basis of these principles not to export arms, no other country should be allowed to complete that sale themselves and so undermine the principle."
"We also have to recognize three other issues essential for the effective working of a code of conduct."
"Firstly, there has to be maximum transparency, i.e. the Council has to report on what it is doing and allow the European Parliament to comment."
"Secondly, we need a fresh initiative, particularly in the light of enhanced police cooperation in the Amsterdam Treaty, to stop the illegal sale of arms."
"Thirdly, we have to step up our efforts to make this an international code of conduct, not just a European code of conduct."
"Mr President, we, the Liberal Group, are delighted with the initiative of the British Presidency to step up the community criteria on arms exports."
"The British Presidency has announced a code of conduct, but this code of conduct must not become a feeble compromise."
"A noncommittal code of conduct is of no use to us."
"Agreements must be made which are enforceable and can be monitored."
"Bilateral agreements are not the solution, because they offer too many opportunities for secret deals ."
"To facilitate effective consultation, the Member States must make internal agreements to guarantee major openness and public and parliamentary control on arms export licences."
"A UN arms sale register is a useful instrument for increasing global transparency regarding arms supplies."
"That is why a new criterion should be included which forbids exports to countries which do not meet the terms of this UN register."
"We liberals will therefore support the amendments made by the Greens."
"Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party thinks that a code of conduct regulating the export of arms is a positive step and, what is more, we should consider it vital if we are to build an efficient PESC."
"To regulate and control the export of arms to countries at war, to countries which do not respect human rights and to unstable regions allows us to indirectly intervene, avoiding an escalation of conflict in such areas."
"If we also establish a clear, unambiguous code which limits the type of arms and technology which can be exported, as well as agreements with other exporting countries - not forgetting companies and other trading countries - we will have taken an important step forward."
"It would be good if the Council, as well as drawing up the code I mentioned, could let us know when it has been completed."
"Mr President, the manufacture, sale and exportation of arms are activities which have never had a very good press, but which still make very good profits for those engaged in them."
"It is also an industry of some political importance, which maintains jobs, which is not negligible these days."
"The adoption of a Code of Conduct within the EU is therefore a necessity."
"Actively preparing to extend it to other countries is also a necessity, but I should like to draw your attention to the list of items involved."
"Certainly, heavy armoured vehicles, supersonic bombers and highly sophisticated equipment should be on it, but we must also remember that the weapons that kill the most, particularly in countries where there is instability, are small-bore weapons, automatic firearms and hand-held weapons."
"Such weapons are used more often than the heavy artillery of a nuclear aircraft carrier to bring down farmers, demonstrators and opponents."
"We should at least agree that they should one day be included in the Code of Conduct."
"Mr President, we welcome the initiative taken by the British Presidency of the Council in playing an active role in this matter and in finally putting this critical point on the agenda."
"Of course, the European Parliament has to be included."
"But it must also make progressive proposals which will lead somewhere."
"For this reason I would like the European Parliament to concentrate on current developments and crisis situations and, this being the case, for light and small arms to play the central role."
"We cannot simply leave them aside; we have to include them. Anyone who has even been in an area of conflict knows just how important this is."
"Cooperation on arms issues requires special consideration of technologies with dual applications."
"It constitutes another aspect of the debate. I am also delighted that our proposal to add a ninth criterion to exclude the supply of arms to countries which do not joint the UN arms register has been taken on board."
"Of course, a codex of this nature has to be put into practice."
"And that means that arms deals must be controlled by national governments."
"Mr President, I would also like to welcome the proposal for appropriate joint action with regard to the EU's arms exports."
"The fact that a majority of the EU's Member States have at least signalled their readiness for a code of conduct is gratifying."
"However, it is surprising that my home country, Finland, has not discussed this or supported the initiative."
"It is surprising because for a small country it is more advantageous to have an arms market which has rules than one which is unregulated."
"It is also surprising because Finland was prepared to discuss production cooperation."
"Why are people not prepared to discuss cooperation and common rules for exports?"
"This is serious."
"We need new rules urgently because the arms trade grew during 1995-1996."
"The code needs to include rules on sensitive areas where we either have a full embargo, selective restrictions or where the States negotiate between themselves."
"All countries should be allowed to participate in these negotiations."
"Mr President, the European Commission is grateful to Parliament for putting this topic on the agenda once more. This debate is taking place at a relatively sensitive time for the European defence industry, and at a time of rapid international development."
"Because of the violent conflicts in many parts of the world, the issue of improved control on arms exports is high on the international agenda, and is being closely followed by the public."
"The present EU regulations concerning arms exports, which are based on the eight points agreed in 1991 and 1992, have not turned out to be very effective."
"These points are too vague and cannot be very easily managed as a guideline either."
"The Commission is distinctly in favour of stricter rules, which make up a clear framework for the discussion about the arms trade."
"We also favour an improvement in the exchange of information and consultation procedures between the Member States."
"This Parliament has made a significant contribution to this debate on the European arms industry by accepting a resolution based on Mr Titley's report, and he generally supports the findings and recommendations made in a Commission statement in January 1996."
"In the resolution the Commission is asked to draw up a White Paper on arms exports, and the services of the Commission are presently working on this."
"I hope that this process can be completed during the next few weeks."
"This document evaluates the position of the European Union in the global arms trade, and discusses the role of the Union in the arms exports policy up until at the present time, and presents a number of options for future action."
"It will also pay attention to the increasingly important issue of illegal trade in small and light arms."
"The British Presidency is determined to make active progress on the road to a restrictive and more transparent European Union arms export policy."
"It intends to submit a EU code of conduct on the arms trade regulations."
"This means a political commitment will be demanded from the Member States, probably in the shape of a statement from the Council."
"I myself raised the subject at the recent visit of the European Commission to the British Presidency in London, and Foreign Secretary Mr Cook assured me that he is presently holding bilateral negotiations with a number of Member States in order to speed up the process towards this code of conduct as much as possible."
"The Commission for its part is prepared to support any initiative which will lead to such a code of conduct being established, and the White Paper is intended as a contribution to these efforts."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0050/98 by Mr Pompidou, Mr Scapagnini and Mr Baldi, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe, on cloning of human beings; -B4-0053/98 by Mr Monfils, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, on cloning of human beings; -B4-0068/98 by Mrs Green and Mr Cot, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on human cloning; -B4-0074/98 by Mr Liese, Mr C.

"Human cloning"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, great apprehension has been aroused by last week's announcement from Professor Richard Seed of his intention to carry out research to apply the technique of cloning to man and the ethical consequences that involves."
"The European Parliament has already come out absolutely firmly against any form of cloning for purposes of reproduction of human beings and passed a clear resolution on the subject on 12 March 1997."
"Taking account of the right to genetic identity and whereas the principle of equality presupposes parity of rights - and hence acceptance of individual differences - banning discrimination and implying, therefore, the inadmissibility of genetically equal individuals and genetic selection, an explicit world ban on cloning of human beings is considered necessary and the responsible authorities are asked to draw up adequate legislation on the subject."
"It is also important to organize a world conference on the issue, in order to reach a common position condemning cloning of human beings."
"Encouraging, assisting and supporting scientific research is a moral obligation for the whole of society."
"But the news arriving from the United States is extremely alarming."
"It smacks of lack of respect for the dignity of the species which governs this planet, even if it does fall into a thousand difficulties and errors."
"Scientific research is following its own path - as it should - and at high speed. But our task is to do our best to encompass research in a legislative framework, by banning human cloning and establishing deterrent penal sanctions for individuals and financial sanctions for states which agree to it."
"However, we are lagging behind and my personal hope is that all the governments of the planet can come together to draw up rules for proper development in harmony with all the facets of nature, animals and last but not least, human beings."
"Mr President, the general disapproval of a project by an American scientist to clone a human being and the initiatives adopted by the Council of Europe in this respect, have indisputably shown that we and a number of countries have not lost our ability to express indignation."
"However, in addition to this case, which no one will deny is serious, there is a need for a fundamental debate on the limits of science, or more exactly on the responsibility of scientists."
"It would be unacceptable, whilst the emotion created by this business is still high, in the name of natural morals or ethics, to set a limit to the research which can be carried out on the genome, soon perhaps to include certain forms of cloning."
"It is always the same old story."
"On the other hand, it would be equally unacceptable if, in the name of absolute scientific freedom, a human being was created to be used for organ transplants, without the human being created by means of cloning having the same rights as a human being born by natural reproduction."
"Cloning a human being, need I repeat, is not, contrary to what its authors says, a scientific venture."
"First of all and above all, it is a media and commercial operation which shows the danger of research which can no longer obtain from public funds the resources it needs for socially acceptable development."
"And that is the real danger."
"Commercial pressure is certain to destroy any research, whose aim is above all to promote social wellbeing."
"Mr President, it has already been said that the cloning revolution we are discussing is nothing new."
"The subject was already widely discussed in March 1997 and in the draft directive on patents."
"I think that if we start the same debate every time that a scientist somewhere in the world tells the media he has gone beyond what is morally permissible, all each part-session will have to do is to clone a resolution on the previous resolution."
"Because, finally, we do have an instrument in Europe. It is, as has already been said, the European Bioethics Convention and its protocol, which prohibits, and I quote: ' Any intervention seeking to create a human being genetically identical to another human being, whether living or dead...'"
"It is up to each Member State to approve the protocol and what prevents some Member States from signing and ratifying the Convention is that it is too inflexible, inasmuch as, for example, it prohibits any intervention on germ cells and any use of embryos for the purposes of scientific research."
"By wanting to prohibit everything, we are preventing the implementation of the Convention."
"Finally, according to us, I would say that it is certainly necessary to prevent aberrations, but we must not however stop scientific research in its exploration of life."
"I share Mr Desama's point of view on this subject."
"Although the cloning of human beings is contrary to the dignity of the human being, the cloning of cells or tissues may make it possible to combat hereditary diseases."
"People who claim to defend humanity by proposing to stop research on living cells only prevent men and women suffering from genetic diseases, in particular, from having a better quality of life, or even from staying alive."
"That is unacceptable."
"Humanity needs scientific progress."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has always spoken out clearly against human cloning, arguing not only on purely technical grounds, but also on issues of principle. Therefore we are not in favour of a moratorium on human cloning, but rather a general ban."
"I also believe that everyone at this plenary session is united behind this demand."
"But what is human cloning?"
"That is the question addressed by the previous speaker and which we must now define."
"On this subject, too, the EP has always taken a very clear position."
"Both in the vote on the Patent Guidelines in June and within the context of the Fifth Research Framework Programme in December we found a clear definition."
"The Legal Committee and the Research Committee have both dealt with these matters intensively and in the Research Committee this issue was the subject of a unanimous vote when all others were hotly disputed."
"I believe it is very important that we continue to hold this position."
"And this is why the EVP has included amendment 8."
"Banning human cloning, for example, does not mean banning work on human cells designed to make skin transplants possible."
"It does mean, however, that both cloned babies and the production of human embryos for use as spare parts for organ transplants must be outlawed."
"For this reason we are very shocked by amendment 1 proposed by Mr Bowe, Mr Monfils and others which rules out cloning for the purposes of reproduction only."
"This could mean, however, that a situation in which one produced a human embryo or, taking the interpretation a stage further, a baby without a brain, cloned it and then used if not for reproduction but as a supply of spare parts for organs, this would clearly not be excluded."
"We must be very clear here."
"The Council of Europe's Monday Clone Protocol expressly omits any reference to reproductive clones and is therefore further-reaching than the demand which has just been detailed."
"As such, it represents a good step in the right direction."
"In conclusion, we must nevertheless ensure that this clone protocol is not open to misinterpretation, like the dangerous image, for example, drawn by the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and it is for this reason that we have submitted Amendment No 9 to close any backdoor routes."
"Mr President, everyone is against the cloning of human beings, of course, and rightly so."
"It is well known that is how things stand, apart of course for certain businessmen, disguised as scientists, who see it as a source of lucrative business."
"And the combination of the lure of profit and contempt for mankind should not make us change our minds!"
"We shall therefore vote for this text, but we would however like to emphasize an important aspect. That is, the importance of the call for an international conference which Monica Baldi mentioned."
"This conference should take place at the end of a moratorium, a determined dialogue between the scientific world, ethics commissions and political leaders on the subject, which is so serious and new to all of us, that many of us are bewildered and have no reliable points of reference on the subject."
"Mr President, we are not speaking here of research relating to therapeutic and medical ends, to which nobody objects."
"We are talking about the cloning of individuals, human beings, and the most important thing one can say, at least with today's attitudes towards the subject, is that nobody can guarantee the health and natural development of individuals produced in that way, in the Brave New World which some people promise us."
"We are therefore right to be concerned for that reason, and to call for a ban."
"Yet, Mr President, that decision and that action we wish to undertake for the future would be pointless unless its scope is world-wide, and in particular, unless it extends to countries which have the ability to go down that road, most of all the United States, where there is a legal vacuum on the subject."
"Mr Clinton's appeals for prohibition relate only to federal funding and not to the private sector."
"On that point I would like to ask: are the Commission and the Council of Ministers disposed, and do they know how and to what extent they could negotiate with the United States, so that we can agree on a common policy over the issue?"
"Mr President, obviously we are all astonished today at the announcement from the United States and also, I would add, by what we have heard from a British bio-ethics committee, which has opened up wide prospects of human cloning for therapeutic purposes."
"This is astonishing and there is opposition to it, but it demonstrates that we Greens were right when we said last year that accepting cloning of animals was an open door to human cloning."
"And here today someone is opening new doors to human cloning, because when it is claimed that human cloning is acceptable for therapeutic purposes, that is another broad path towards the final destination which will inevitably be cloning of human beings."
"Also, when we speak of human beings it is clear that we must explicitly define what human beings are and say that cloning must be banned from the start of conception throughout all the embryonic stages."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament's view is clear and unambiguous."
"The dignity of mankind forbids any form of cloning."
"In the vote on the 5th Research Framework Programme we also refused the provision of funds for research which amounts to human cloning."
"Respect for our fellow creatures as well as other considerations also make the cloning of animals a extremely questionable endeavour at the very least."
"Today, reports on a money-hungry madman who calls himself a scientist are forcing us to hold this debate for clarification."
"This clarification is required to ensure that one perverse case of abuse does not discredit the entire field of biotechnology which we associate with hopes and high expectations."
"But there is also a question which we must ask ourselves. Have we done everything we can to ensure that this new area of research and technology does not slip out of our control and direct itself against men or even mankind?"
"We have certainly tried."
"Today we have before us a network of laws and guidelines which regulate and protect but which also offer loopholes and hiding places which could lead to the abuse of biotechnology."
"It is my view, therefore, that a framework guideline is needed which marks out the field and makes the many individual rules transparent."
"It must cover all aspects of the issue, including uniform provisions in criminal law which impose severe penalties on the flouting of regulations and violation of bans."
"This difficult work is our duty as citizens of the European Union."
"We must not dodge it. We must ask the Member States to sign a Council of Europe document today."
"On one hand, the so-called Bioethics Convention fails to solve the problem."
"On the other, it offers the principle of subsidiarity under which each Member State may decide whether or not to ratify it."
"For this reason let us remove Point 2 from the joint resolution."
"Mr President, from a scientific point of view, considering the cloning of humans by the method used with the now famous Dolly, it must be said that the experiment of creating her was the only one to succeed among very many failures."
"Consequently, the method has not been scientifically perfected, its medium and long-term results are unknown, and there has been no investigation of all the possible consequences for the organism of the cloned animal."
"It is therefore shocking when a scientist says, without circumlocution, that he is going to clone a human being."
"Because not only is that not justified on scientific grounds, but it is equivalent to dangerous and I would even say criminal experiments with humans."
"Mr President, we still have to consider the ethical, legal and social aspects of the problem, because if cloning is applied to mankind this essentially opens the way towards eugenics."
"Echoes of the creation of the Aryan race and the Superman have still not died down even today."
"Who is to do the cloning and under what conditions?"
"Will it be available for all?"
"Will special permits be needed?"
"There are still very many related questions, which show that the issue is exceptionally complex, and that it harbours the risk of distorting human societies."
"It is a fact that in the face of headlong scientific progress the legal systems of our countries have found themselves unprepared."
"And consequently, it is important that the laws should be adapted well in time, with objectives such as protection of the individual, safeguarding the interests of the group, and defending society's values."
"This nightmare prospect of human cloning must be banned well in time, because it would create insuperable problems in our societies."
"Mr President, every scientific revolution brings reactions and creates conditions of insecurity."
"Galileo was condemned by the Holy Inquisition."
"In-vitro fertilization as a way of producing children was also deplored, and world-wide public opinion still regards euthanasia with mistrust."
"Cloning, however, reminds us by association of the Nazi doctor Mengele and his tragic experiments."
"It is a repulsive prospect to produce human beings who are faithful copies, because every human is unique and his uniqueness is the nucleus of thought and creativity."
"The lack of a simultaneous international legal framework and the evident possibility of unethical and politically dangerous exploitation in the cloning of humans has caused the international scientific community to react with reservations."
"The European Parliament's duty is to determine the fine line which defines what is ethically acceptable and socially permissible and beneficial."
"The rules, however, Commissioner, must be strict enough to prevent the realization of unwholesome phenomena."
"At the same time, they must apply world-wide."
"I would like to ask you whether you have considered, within the scope of this effort, trying together with the UN to establish such world-wide legislation in relation to cloning."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are scientists who say yes, we will clone humans."
"This is a major affront to human dignity."
"It is the irresponsible breaking of ethical dams and taboos."
"An absence of ethical boundaries would be a terrifying thing for humanity."
"Knowledge without conscience is a horrific scenario!"
"Yet here we are, faced with a kind of mad and undreamt-of omnipotence."
"Unfortunately, the nightmare of a ""made to measure' human being or the breeding of humans as a supply of spare parts is becoming more and more realistic, and unimagined ethics are being pushed ever forward."
"The international community still has no binding regulations and even in the European Union science has no ethical boundaries."
"On the contrary, increasingly it is the scientists who are setting the ethical boundaries for society."
"Even the cloning of animals provides expertise for the future cloning of humans."
"So what we need - and I ask the Commission if it is ready to do this - is a worldwide non-proliferation treaty for cloning techniques."
"We need the worldwide outlawing of cloning because what is technically feasible will one day be done."
"It also seems to me to be essential that we exert some economic pressure!"
"I believe that within the framework of the WTO we should boycott international groups and countries who are not prepared to devise binding rules on the banning of cloning."
"In this regard, I should be glad to know whether the Commission is prepared to go beyond non-binding declarations and statements, whether it is prepared to go a step further, to sign a binding agreement and make a worldwide ban on cloning."
"Mr President, in the discussion about what is scientifically possible we must first of all ask: what is its feasibility or its moral desirability?"
"This question is also at the heart of this issue."
"Considering the many reactions of horror to the plans of the American scientist Richard Seed, the moral undesirability of the cloning of humans in this case appears to be winning against the desire for scientific advance."
"And rightly so."
"Cloning technology leaves nothing to chance, and makes bad copies."
"In actual fact, it adds nothing."
"Going a step further and improving a certain gene in the clone, we reach the dangerous zone of racial improvement."
"Little good can be expected of this technique, in other words."
"What is the situation regarding the clone?"
"During the discussions on human rights our group has frequently remarked that the freedom of one is bounded by the freedom of another."
"This also applies here."
"The human dignity, the individuality and identity of man is at issue, and man is reduced to a consumer article."
"So it is gratifying that, at the Council of Europe, a charter awaiting signature which forbids the cloning of humans."
"Yet I still have my reservations about the future."
"I recognize God as the Creator of man."
"I see the new human life which originates in the conjunction between man and women as a unique gift from God."
"As far as I am concerned the lines are very sharply drawn."
"It means an absolute ban on the cloning of humans."
"Yet to many countries this ban already does not seem to be wholly absolute."
"Thus it is worrying that the Netherlands, England and Germany have still not signed the charter."
"Pressure must be put on these countries."
"I sincerely hope that we decide on an absolute, tough position against human cloning."
"It is vital."
"Mr President, last April over twenty countries signed the Council of Europe Convention at Oviedo, which constitutes the best contribution Europe can make to the world debate on bio-medicine and medical research, but it only represents a first step towards regulating the matter."
"At a time when science and new laboratory techniques are being identified as a power capable of conditioning modern man and the man of the future, it is becoming essential, in our view, for this debate to be open and democratic."
"Medical research is indispensable for alleviating suffering and improving human health, but there must be boundaries which cannot be crossed - and I say that as a doctor and not as a politician - and those are the boundaries of the actual dignity and identity of man."
"Experiments in cloning, but also trade in embryos, gametes and genetic material, are taking place not only in Europe but all over the world without any controls and this demonstrates that it is now urgent to deal with bioethical issues and find solutions."
"The signature and ratification of the Council of Europe Convention last April, and its additional protocol specifically banning human cloning, could be the start of the solution, but the Union's partner countries must be urgently involved."
"Determined defence of a people's rights will increase their dignity, freedom, integrity and right to health."
"So it is the duty of the Alleanza Nazionale delegation to give its support and approval to the motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, I believe that Dr Seed is a buccaneer who is seeking to create a market opportunity which he will then exploit without licence and without responsibility."
"It is also significant that when the Commission's group of advisors were asked to look at the question of Dolly the sheep and her cloning, they did so after Dolly had been born and the gravest danger is now that even though we know that human cloning may be scientifically possible we are making scientific advance without the same advance being made in our ethical considerations."
"That being the case, we need to establish and ethical committee."
"The common position of the Council in response to the Rothley report leaves a great deal to be desired."
"I do not believe that common position reflects what Parliament has voted and consequently at the second reading of the Rothley report I will retable Parliament's original amendment thus making it, if we pass it, a precondition of the patenting directive that we shall establish a satisfactory ethical committee."
"Failure to do that means that cloning will take place and will take place on an open market."
"Mr President, I wonder if there is anything original I can add to this debate when virtually everything has been said."
"I think it is right to specify general aversion to cloning of human beings at any stage in their development."
"I emphasize ""human being' ."
"This does not mean individual somatic cells which might be reproduced in order to cure, say, a skin disease, the reproduction of epithelial cells."
"That is my first point."
"My second point is that there is no international document or internal document in the individual European states permitting cloning of human beings."
"The European Parliament itself repeatedly expressed its view on this issue right up to the final proposal for a directive on legal protection of bio-technological inventions, but it was already very clear on the subject in 1989 with two resolutions on ethical and legal problems of artificial human procreation and genetic engineering."
"I am pleased to recall, in respect of the latter, that in the report presented by Mr Rothley in 1989 a very strong expression was used to indicate the legal reason which militates against cloning, and that is the destruction of personality."
"In reality the cloning of human beings raises two fundamental principles of law: the principle of human dignity and the principle of equality, equality which presupposes diversity, because equality lies in dignity regardless of the diversity which makes each of us unique."
"Making us equal - paradoxically - is actually a way of destroying equality."
"My final point is this: we can certainly ask whether it is right for a Parliament to be concerned and take action to repeat things already said in television or newspaper statements."
"I think it is right; given the gravity of the matter it is important to be vigilant."
"It would have been much better to have talked about the atom bomb before building it."
"Science is not at stake, technique is at stake, and technique is in the hands of man, who needs to know which track to go down."
"Mr President, as the last speaker on this subject, it will perhaps be even more difficult for me to be original than the others, but I should however like to draw the attention of all the Members of this House to the aberration of the arrival of 'Dolly' , which has caused considerable emotion in public opinion, and also in this Parliament."
"We immediately voted in a resolution prohibiting human cloning, which we feared that Dolly would lead to - which was obviously true."
"But what is more serious is that as time has passed, the emotion has died down, and now one can hear, in this House and elsewhere, more moderate statements to the effect that some forms of human cloning would be acceptable."
"I therefore believe that what we now need is a totally unambiguous resolution."
"We must be quite clear."
"Cloning of human beings must be totally banned for reasons which have been widely discussed and which are, of course, related to human dignity and the eugenic threat."
"Ingusci"
"Mr President, first of all I would like to say how pleased I am that we are discussing Ingushetia today."
"Many people have forgotten that just a few years ago the conflict in ChechnyaIngushetia was a frequent topic of discussion."
"The Ingushetis belong to the same ethnic group as the Chechens."
"Today the situation in this country is very difficult, primarily because it is not one, self-contained area of settlement, but two large enclaves, namely Vladikavkaz and Prigorodny."
"The Ingushetis formerly living in North Ossetia were effectively driven out as a result of a massive push by the Russians and have had to return to Ingushetia where they now constitute a huge and very difficult refugee problem which we must somehow address because we don't want to see a repeat of the Chechnya conflict."
"A further problem, of course, is the fact that the Russians are now claiming that the Ingushetis helped the Chechens and must therefore be punished."
"We are acutely aware that severe restrictions - I am endeavouring to avoid the word blockade - are being imposed on Ingushetia which means that the country is devoid of any meaningful economic development, and that the winter is creating a very difficult situation for the population, particularly for the weakest members, the women and children, who are suffering the most."
"Today the situation is such that the UNHCR has asked for our help in resolving it, for considerable funds to provide accommodation so that these refugees are not obliged to live and suffer in these conditions and for our assistance in ensuring that these refugees are able to return to their original settlements."
"They will only be able to do this if we make our influence felt in Russia and exert pressure, and if we send aid to the right place."
"Mr President, there is nothing much to add after what Carl Habsburg-Lothringen has just said."
"He understands the situation perfectly."
"It is very difficult situation."
"I would however like to stress that a whole region is involved, not just Ingushetia."
"It is the Republic of Chechnya, and the after-effects of the war waged there."
"There are other adjoining areas, such as Dagestan."
"The European Union, and for a start, the Commission, should perhaps pay more attention to that area, because in my opinion, it will be a source of further conflict."
"We must envisage solutions urgently."
"I think that the Russians have shown that they do not have much intention of changing anything and that the European Union should perhaps make certain suggestions."
"We still have a serious humanitarian problem, which cannot wait."
"I believe that the Commission is able to oppose this type of situation and I hope that the European Union will very soon become deeply involved in this area."
"Mr President, the Ingushetia/North Ossetia conflict is a forgotten conflict."
"To date, the 60, 000 exiles who have been housed in temporary accommodation since 1992 and the children who have been effectively unable to lead normal lives since then have received little attention in European politics."
"Although their return has been agreed, this has not yet proved a practical possibility due to the security situation."
"Each incursion spreads renewed panic amongst the waiting population and revives the hatred."
"So far there has been no reduction of the potential for conflict in the region."
"The Russian ruling power has failed to gain acceptance and the UNHCR remains the only body with any sort of mandate to control the Prigorodny conflict."
"Action to prevent the escalation of the conflict is urgently required."
"Many times in reports I have indicated the need for the EU to commit humanitarian aid on an ongoing rather than a sporadic basis."
"That is why I am calling for the ECHO mandate to be extended to Prigorodny and for the EU to assist the OSZE fact finding mission there in bringing international support into the region in order to resolve the conflict."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution tabled by Mr Habsburg and Mr Oomen-Ruijten is rather glib."
"It is true that a siege always causes regrettable suffering."
"It is certainly not for fun that the government of the Russian Federation has now been obliged to impose restrictions on movement in the Northern Caucasus."
"The Russian Federation is trying to prevent another war due to terrorist and Mafia-type activity."
"Every one would regret having voted in favour of Mr Habsburg's and Mr Oomen-Ruijten's motion for a resolution if another war were to break out there because of unconsidered removal of the restrictions on movement."
"We would therefore have to say like Cassandra, in the poet Aeschylus' words: ' whilst you make vows, they prepare to kill' ."
"It is therefore up to the European Parliament to trust the Russian government, which is trying, under difficult conditions, to restore peace and public order, which are the main prerequisites which will enable the population to live in that area under normal conditions."
"Some seem to be playing the dangerous game of encouraging all sorts of separatism in Russia, for commercial reasons, or in the service of a foreign superpower."
"It is not by such means that peace will be restored in the Northern Caucasus."
"Democratic Republic of Congo"
"Mr President, with regard to the arbitrary imprisonment of Mr Arthur Ngoma, Leo Tindemans and I have tabled a motion for a resolution on the political situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, firstly because we know and respect Mr Ngoma, who worked for a long time at UNESCO, was opposed to the Mobutu dictatorship, and is one of the main political leaders in the former Zaire to have bravely denounced the politics of repression and violence put in place by the new leadership."
"However, as well as the individual case of Mr Ngoma and also of Mr Nsala, Secretary General of the Human Rights Centre, we and the other signatories of this document, wish to draw the attention of this House and of the leaders of public opinion in our various countries to the real character of the regime which is being set up under the deceptive name of the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"It would certainly have been unrealistic to think that a country, which for very many years, was subjected to an arbitrary and corrupt leadership, would be able, in a few months, to transform itself into a country where the principles of democracy, the values of humanism and respect for human rights would be honoured."
"Nevertheless, many Congolese and international observers believed in Mr Kabila's good faith and good will, when after seizing power, he announced a calendar of reforms which would lead the country towards legislative and presidential elections in April 1999."
"Now, not only have the first three intended reforms not taken place, but the leadership is becoming more and more harsh: political parties have been banned, more and more arbitrary arrests are taking place, many political opponents, journalists and human rights activists are detained under inhuman conditions, and torture is a regular occurrence."
"Under these circumstances, the European Union cannot remain indifferent."
"It must show its indignation; it must demand the immediate release of all political prisoners; it must exert pressure (and has the means to do so) to make President Kabila carry out his commitments, re-establish basic freedoms and start a process of democratization with no return."
"Many countries, including France, but not only France..."
"(The president cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, I do not wish to speak in this debate to disagree in any way with the indignation at the violation of the most basic human rights perpetrated in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"This group, which is furthermore one of the initiators of the resolution on which we shall presently vote, unreservedly condemns the very serious acts of intimidation targeting all those who dare to express the least criticism of the regime set up in Kinshasa."
"On this subject, I am in total agreement with Bernard Stasi's opinion."
"As for myself, I should like to draw the attention of the Presidency of the EU, and of the Commission, to the fate of two of our nationals, Jean-Marie Bergesio, a French civil engineering contractor and Antoine Declercq, one of his employees, who is Belgian."
"Both were arrested on 10 September 1997, and since then have been detained by the security services of the Democratic Republic of Congo, without any reason being given for their arrest."
"In addition, they have been systematically refused the services of a lawyer."
"I therefore ask the Presidency of the EU to show the greatest determination and firmness, and to obtain clear answers from the authorities of that country on the situation of these two Europeans, and what they are really accused of, their only crime, Mr President, having been to witness the massacre of Hutu refugees in Eastern Zaire."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two fundamental requirements in our approach to the problems raised by recent developments in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"First, it is absolutely necessary to subordinate any international Community aid to this state to the progress actually made in respect for human rights and the real activation of a democratic process in that country."
"Second, it is necessary to maintain this democratic process firmly and in particular help the NGOs working for human rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"It is pointless to mince words: we recognize the indubitable difficulties Mr Kabila's government faces, but this cannot constitute, by any title or in homage to any authority including any external to the European Union, a reason for lowering our guard."
"Indigenous peoples of Australia"
"Mr President, this resolution does not just concern Australia but concerns the worldwide problem of the land rights of indigenous people."
"The relationship of the indigenous peoples worldwide to the land is perhaps a more accurate description, because the tradition in the part of the world to which we refer is that indigenous people have a collective relationship to the land rather than individual tenure, which is typical of the Western world."
"We had experience of that in Scotland when the clan system was replaced by individual landownership."
"We have seen it in the Wild West in the United States."
"You can see echoes of it in the Sami people in the north of Scandinavia."
"In Australia the aborigines say that the land does not belong to them or to the whites but that they belong to the land."
"You have to be aware that when they say this they are talking about traditional migratory patterns in which the sacred places which give them identity belong."
"Let me end with a quotation from the Australian Senate."
"Three months ago it said that the Australian Government should proceed no further with the Jabiluka uranium proposal."
"I wish to support that proposition."
"Mr President, this is my first speech from the Green Group in the European Parliament, and I hope you will be gentle with me."
"It is also very appropriate that it is about Australia, because I am a past chairman of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Australia and New Zealand, and I have just returned from Australia, where the issue of aboriginal land and native title is dividing the country down the middle."
"There will be an election later this year on this very precise issue, which this resolution today highlights in terms of uranium mining, but which actually concerns the whole country in relation to aboriginal access to their native land."
"So this is a very timely resolution."
"I hope we adopt it overwhelmingly and thereby send a message to the Australian Government."
"The Deputy Prime Minister of Australia will be glad to know it denounced me twice in the Australian Parliament during the ten days of my visit to Australia when I spoke in support of aboriginal land rights right across Australia."
"I want this Parliament to be on record that Europe is watching Australia very carefully on this issue, and I hope we can return to it in months to come."
"Mr President, in many places in the world we are seeing violations of the human rights of indigenous populations."
"It is no coincidence that not long ago, we were talking about indigenous people in Chiapas, that we are now talking about Australia, and that Tibet is on the agenda, notwithstanding all the beautiful declarations which have been integrated into the Union system."
"In the case of Australia it is a concrete point we want to raise, namely the fact that the Australian government has decided to start developing the uranium project in Jabiluka, a project situated in a region which is considered a cultural heritage site, and which is recognized by Australian law according as the region belonging to the aborigines."
"Besides, and I think it is very important to draw attention to this, the Australian Senate has called on the government to put a stop to this project."
"I think it is vital that we have a clear vote here today to ask the government to respect the land rights of the aborigines, and call on the Member States to check from which countries they import uranium in case the rights of the indigenous people are affected."
"Executions"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, South Korea is going through a difficult time."
"The financial crisis impacts on all aspects of life."
"A major political U-turn has brought to power a former dissident."
"The mass execution of 23 prisoners which took place at the end of December, was hardly good news. Fifty other prisoners have been sentenced to death."
"It goes without saying that to my group the death penalty can never ever be justified."
"At a time when so much is in flux in Korea this is the wrong message to the people of this country and to the people of other countries."
"Democratization, openness and humane penalties are the answer to this situation in which a nation has been led into uncertainty on a major scale."
"Humane penalties instead of the death penalty is one of the most important symbols of the state of law and of true democracy."
"Several countries are following this route, and we are calling on the South Korean government to do the same."
"Mr President, Mr Bertens has said it with regard to South Korea, but we also have the case of the United States, one of the States in particular, Texas, in which more than half of all American death sentences are carried out."
"Like Mr Bertens, I should to remind the house of the slogan of a campaign which my party, the Radical Party, is running, which is, as we cannot save them one by one, we must try to save them all."
"That is why we are working, within the framework of the campaign, to set up a universal moratorium on executions."
"May I take advantage of the presence of Commissioner Van den Broek to ask him whether in the absence of any initiatives by the Member States, the Commission could not, to a certain extent, become a co-ordinator of those in many Member States in favour of an initiative next autumn, at the United Nations General Assembly, for a resolution, and therefore a vote in favour of instituting a universal moratorium on capital punishment."
"Mr President, I think it is a terrible shame that a so-called civilized country like the United States has to be criticized in this Parliament."
"It considers itself the moral police force of the world and yet it carries out the most appalling crime, basically a crime against humanity, in imposing the death sentence."
"I agree totally with the last speaker about the fact that a woman is being sentenced to death on 3 February."
"I call on the Americans and on the Texas authorities to commute her sentence and to put a stay on her execution."
"It is unacceptable that such a punishment is carried out in a country that considers itself advanced."
"It is quite clear that this form of punishment is not a deterrent to crime."
"In fact if you look at the rising crime figures in the United States it is clear that such an abhorrent punishment does not work and it is about time the Americans actually realised that they are way behind the rest of the international community and cannot point the finger at other, what I would call more primitive countries that we criticize with regard to the death penalty."
"Until they actually realise that they are totally in the wrong here they cannot point the finger at anyone else."
"We have to do everything to ensure that this woman's sentence is commuted and that there is a stay of her execution."
"Tibet"
"Mr President, on this point, I should first of all like to say to the Commission that our dispute here is getting out of hand."
"It is obviously not Commissioner van den Broek who is implicated but Sir Leon Brittan."
"Over the last three years, this House has accumulated a number of very specific resolutions on the question of Tibet and the People's Republic of China."
"We have often received good answers from Sir Leon, but they have not led to any action or follow-up; we have not received a reply with regard to the Panchen Lama; we have not had a reply concerning Mr Hada; we have had not reply concerning Mr Wang Dan; we have not had a reply concerning the very important matter of opening a dialogue with the Dalai Lama."
"It is therefore about time that the Commission made full use of its powers."
"If Sir Leon Brittan gave to these matters just 1 % of the inventiveness and creativity he devotes to economic and commercial matters, I am sure that he would get results."
"I therefore think that it is now urgent for the Commission and Sir Leon in particular to start to give us specific answers to all the questions asked repeatedly by Parliament over the last two years."
"One of the central demands of the joint resolution is before this Parliament is that a EU envoy should be appointed for Tibet."
"There are two very good reasons for this."
"Firstly, the Dalai Lama himself is requesting this, and secondly, and it is important for the colleagues to realize this, the United States have a special envoy for Tibet., He could make a contribution to the normalization of relations, amongst other things, and the Dalai Lama has indicated that he is greatly in favour of this normalization of relations."
"We also know that, should an envoy be active in the country, many embargoed dossiers will finally be released."
"You therefore get an instrument for a permanent presence."
"Finally, I have to agree fully with colleague Dupuis when he points to a number of inconsistencies caused by of Parliament, for example the releasing of funds for the Panam project, whilst it was known that on that front the relationship with the Tibetan people was not being correctly observed."
"Mr President, as has been said, the United States Congress and Government have appointed a special representative for Tibet."
"I think that is an important political event and I believe that the European Union should also appoint such a figure."
"In my view that is the core of this resolution."
"The time has come to open direct negotiations between China and the Dalai Lama."
"Faced with the tragedy of the Tibetan people, the Dalai Lama is not asking for independence, as he has repeated many times, in particular in his speech on the anniversary of the Chinese occupation, but a wide autonomy within the Chinese nation."
"I think this position is enlightened and courageous and leaves China no excuse."
"Moreover, the changed international situation has eliminated any real or supposed threat to the frontiers of that country."
"So, in my view, it is in the interests of a China which wants to become part of the international scene to confront and resolve problems which create obstacles to this involvement."
"Taiwan, Tibet, human rights generally, are now the international community's main criticisms of China."
"I appreciate the tone of the document which has been prepared and which, for the first time, associates a concrete proposal with denunciation and criticism."
"It is a step forward for Parliament which is helping it to be more effective politically."
"Naturally this attitude of Parliament - less propaganda and more politically effectiveness - increases the responsibility of European Union bodies, in particular the Commission and the Council."
"Actually, with this initiative on Tibet, we are asking both the Commission and the Council - as colleagues have mentioned - to take a more effective attitude."
"We are not happy that the general statements of both the Commission and the Council or their spokespersons are critical and, naturally, speak of respect for human rights, while in reality things go on as they have done up to now."
"Mr President, I am very grateful to Mrs Aglietta for incorporating the idea of a special EU representative for Tibet in her resolution and for maintaining it in the joint resolution."
"I made the same proposal last year during question time under the Luxemburg Presidency of the Council and saw how strongly Mr Wohlfahrt responded to the idea at the time."
"He promised to push the issue in the Council accordingly."
"We should hold discussions with the British Presidency without delay to ensure that these words become deeds."
"It is my belief that we need a special representative of this kind, just as the United States do."
"We often have grounds here to criticise American foreign policy, but in this case American foreign policy has set a very important example."
"In the case of Tibet we are dealing with a very serious problem of human rights and a very serious problem of a people's right to self-determination."
"The Chinese think in very long time-frames and we should not therefore react with short term displays of concern, but rather with a long term strategy, and for this we need a special representative."
"Mr President, the elections which took place in Kenya were hardly faultless."
"They have never been thus in Kenya since the country's independence."
"We have not been able to observe any improvement."
"The most remarkable thing about these elections was the enormous enthusiasm amongst the people."
"In Kenya, too, the following should really apply: ""First feed me, and then you can preach to me' ."
"Arap MoÃ¯ has managed to lower the income per capita, and yet the enthusiasm for democracy has not diminished."
"I think the European Commission should take advantage of this."
"The most urgent issue in Kenya at the moment is how to combat corruption."
"The Commission will have to support the newspapers which expose this, in all sorts of ways."
"It will especially have to support non-governmental organizations who wish to promote democracy on all sorts of levels."
"These are small things which in my view can have great results."
"Mr President, within the framework of the so-called urgent procedure, this House is often called upon to deplore, regret and condemn, and although one swallow does not make a summer, we are also called upon to note the positive conditions under which elections have just taken place in Kenya, in a country everyone agreed was on the verge of a social revolution several weeks ago, and which is certainly not out of the wood."
"Observers agree, despite a few irregularities, that the elections were free and honest."
"Whatever one may think of President Arap Moi, of the long time he has spent in politics, of his idea of a dialogue, or of his regional role in certain recent problems, he has been elected."
"It is not up to the European Parliament to put itself in the place of an opposition which is incapable of getting together to offer alternative policies."
"That is why the Group of the Radical Alliance will confine itself to encouraging the Kenyan authorities to combat corruption and consolidate human rights, particularly the freedoms of association, demonstration and expression, which are often flouted, and which we ask the Commission to monitor."
"That is the purpose of this motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, the first thing I would like to say is that President Moi must deliver on his preelection promises for constitutional reform."
"We know now that the election results were so close that the opposition must be given a role in government to reflect the massive popular support they now hold."
"They must also obviously be allowed fair access to the media."
"I want to join with those who have condemned the allegations of rigging in the recent electoral process."
"I would like to repeat the call made by the presidency on 6 January asking for a public investigation into alleged electoral irregularities."
"Massive amounts of money have apparently been spent on corrupt electioneering."
"This will have a detrimental effect on the delicate economy there and push up inflation."
"This is very bad news for the local people coming as it does after last year's floods, the problems of the tourist industry which is affected by ethnic clashes, and the recent weak commodity prices."
"President Moi will have to get the message, given that the IMF and the World Bank have already suspended aid."
"He must see the clear link between the necessary loan and aid packages, which are vital to the country's economic well-being, and the democratic and constitutional reforms which we all expect of him."
"Mr President, at the end of December, President Daniel was re-elected President of Kenya."
"With a little more than 40 % of the vote, he improved his 1992 score by 4 per cent."
"The fourteen opposition candidates shared the remaining 60 %, but their divisions, maintained by constant disagreements, has brought them in disorder into a Parliament where Mr Arap Moi's party has retained the absolute majority by two seats."
"We expected the elections to be contested, and we have discussed the problem of Kenya often enough in this chamber not to be surprised today at some confusion in the announcement of the results."
"Having said that, I wish to say that the UPE group will support the joint motion of the Radicals and Liberals for two reasons."
"The first is that I note, first of all, the 'satisfactory' stamp given to these elections by national observers, and by the President of Uganda, who said, and I hope he was joking, that if the President of Kenya had cheated, he was not very good at it as he only achieved a majority of two seats."
"Paragraph 7 of the resolution partially reflects my first reason."
"I therefore suppose that this House will agree to show indulgence to Kenya and for many of us, Uganda's approval will make it possible to withdraw the particular vigilance to which others countries have not been subjected."
"The second reason is that, as other elections will be held in Africa in 1998, this kind of moderation with regard to countries moving from a single party to a multipartite system should be extended to other countries and Frenchspeaking countries should not treated more harshly by this House than English-speaking countries."
"Mr President, I thank the honourable delegates for their valuable speeches."
"I would to like to start with a response to the debate about human cloning."
"It is heartening to note that almost without exception everyone in this Parliament dissociates himself from this practice and also cautions us the developments in this area."
"The European Commission has given its opinion on this before and has shown its determination to make a contribution to the prevention of any development in this field."
"It considers the cloning of humans as degrading, and contrary to human uniqueness."
"From the debate this afternoon this also emerged very clearly to be the opinion of this Parliament."
"In the research framework programmes, the fourth or fifth, you will find not a single programme which encourages these type of activities, let alone finances them."
"We dissociate ourselves very distinctly from this."
"The group of advisors on the ethical implications of biotechnology has given its opinion on human cloning, and rejects it."
"The Commission is aware that in the context of the research programmes it has no authority on the specific area of ethics, but when it concerns ethical issues, I think the European Commission should at least give its opinion, and that is what we are doing now."
"The European Council in Amsterdam in June last year was unambiguous about this, and let it be known that it wishes to dissociate itself from human cloning."
"If one observes what is happening internationally on this front in terms of discussions, then we can note we satisfaction that even the G8 Summit in Denver in the middle of last year declared itself against human cloning."
"During the debate this afternoon the additional protocol at a convention of the Council of Europe on human rights and biotechnology was mentioned."
"This charter has meanwhile been signed by nine Member States."
"It appears that the United Nations would be the most suitable forum for this."
"The Commission will in any case attempt to stimulate development in this direction."
"It will attempt to make a contribution."
"The situation in Ingushetia can be called downright worrying."
"We are following the developments via our delegation in Moscow and via our contacts with the United Nations, the OSCE and other international organizations which are working in this turbulent region."
"You know that over the past few years ECHO has financed humanitarian aid to Ingushetia; in 1997 MÃ©decins sans frontiÃ¨res carried out a programme amounting to ECU 200 000, primarily for homeless communities."
"We will obviously continue with these programmes and are in regular contact with the High Commissioner for Refugees about the situation on the spot."
"I can only report that during the recent past carrying out these humanitarian projects has not become any easier because of the frequently risky conditions for humanitarian aid workers."
"The human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo continues to be closely watched by the European Commission."
"It is a positive sign that the government of Congo has given the investigation committee of the United Nations the go-ahead to do its work, and has set up a constitutional committee."
"In support of this positive development, the European Commission has decided to remove restrictions on certain actions for the reconstruction of the country, to the direct benefit of the people there."
"But on the basis of the contract entered into with the Commission, these actions will be carried out by non-governmental organizations or businesses."
"As far as the aborigines in Australia are concerned, the Commission assumes that stringent rules and monitoring standards, as argued for, by the Australian Environment Minister senator Robert Hill will be attached to the eventual implementation of the Jabiluka project, about which Mrs Aelvoet also spoke."
"This concern for the health of the local aboriginal community and concern for the environment is extremely important."
"As you know the Commission shares the European Parliament's considerations regarding the death penalty which was also discussed this afternoon."
"I am talking about Australia now."
"I am talking about the unfortunate executions which happened in Korea recently, and with which the practice of the past two years not carry out death sentences, was altered again."
"In its contacts with Korea the Commission will explain clearly its concern about this change in the republic of South Korea's policy."
"Now to China and Tibet."
"I will limit myself to the following comments, now that the President-in-Office of the Council has clearly indicated how much importance he attaches to an intensification of the dialogue with China, in particular on issues such as human rights."
"It is encouraging that in the meetings which took place during the second half of last year, both on ministerial level and on the level of political directors, progress was made on a number of issues."
"We now know that China is preparing ratification of the UN social and economic rights covenant, but that it is also prepared to consider whether to proceed to signing the well-known UN covenant on civil and political rights."
"In addition there is also a promise from China that the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs Robinson, can look forward to an invitation to visit China."
"As far as Tibet is concerned, a positive signal has been given with regard to the request from the European Union to send a delegation of ambassadors to the country in the spring of 1998."
"They are all steps forward which indicate that dialogue with China on human rights is not blocked."
"The European Union, supported by the European Commission, definitely intends to continue this way with China."
"To conclude with the situation in Kenya: the large turn-out at the most recent elections in Kenya, and the fact that the observers found that the will of the Kenyan people was expressed in a reasonably reliable way are a reason for optimism."
"At the same time it has not escaped anyone's attention that there were some irregularities during these elections."
"But according to the observers this did not make it a less representative election."
"This in itself is positive."
"We wish to underline that constitutional reform in Kenya is an important part of this, and this should be initiated as soon as possible."
"It is important that all groups in society are genuinely represented in this process, and that the necessary consultation takes place with all these groups, and that openness is actively pursued."
"The importance of human rights in our relations with Kenya is entirely clear to that country's authorities, and has been raised more than once."
"We also agree with the points made during the debate this afternoon regarding the need to tackle vigorously the relatively widespread corruption in Kenya."
"This is also very important in connection with the confidence which must be inspired within the international financial organizations, and for that matter, also within the European Union when it concerns the support which was requested to initiate and develop the economy."
"It is, of course, extremely distressing that in a country like Kenya the present income per capita is in fact lower than ten years ago."
"That says something about the situation there."
"These were the rather patchy comments I wished to make about these important topics."
"Also in view the extremely limited time the honourable delegates had at their disposal, I do not wish to abuse your indulgence any further."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"Mr President, in the European Union another attempt on life has been made."
"A European citizen, committed to his people and democratically elected to defend peace, liberty, the right of law and tolerance has been killed by enemies of Basque society for which they propose the exact opposite: death, terror, extortion and blackmail."
"JosÃ© Ignacio Iruretagoyena, married, father of two very young children, councillor on Zarautz Town Council Government, has been cruelly murdered, victim of a terrorist attack from the criminal group ETA."
"Firstly our condolences go to his widow, his orphans and all the families who have been suffering death and oppression from the terrorist group ETA."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is a problem which not only affects the Basques or even all Spaniards."
"This continued violation of fundamental human rights affects the whole of the European Union and therefore this Parliament is raising its voice again to point once more to the seriousness of the terrorist problem and its fully European dimension."
"I want to record here the permanent support and solidarity that this assembly has shown in regard to this serious problem."
"Recently, this chamber received a visit from the family of councillor Miguel Angel Blanco, whose murder by ETA last July filled the squares and towns throughout Europe with great expressions of horror and support for peace. We also welcomed the family of JosÃ© Antonio Ortega Lara, a prison officer, whose kidnapping lasted more than 500 days."
"The European Parliament itself has moved to the Basque country to demonstrate there to Basque institutions the European dimension of this very grave problem, the most flagrant violation of human rights which exists today in the Union."
"We cannot forget how, in the last six months, we have witnessed no less than the kidnap and liberation of Ortega Lara or the murders of democratically elected councillors Gregorio OrdÃ³ez, in San SebastiÃ¡n; Miguel Angel Blanco, in Ermua;"
"JosÃ© Luis Caso, in RenterÃ­a; JosÃ© Ignacio Iruretagoyena, in Zarautz; and the failed attempt against the San SebastiÃ¡n councillor, Elena Azpiroz."
"Tomorrow in Vitoria the Ajuria-Enea Council will meet."
"We want to send our unconditional support to its members so that they can find ways which will lead to peace, within the limits offered by the legal system, which terrorists are so much against."
"This bloodbath and reign of terror have to end."
"Mr President, once again human beings - although it seems unreasonable to call them this - have taken away the life of another human being, as part of their fight against democracy for all."
"Democracy is the only political and moral system which can see off terrorists, and they know this very well."
"The Basques have killed a Basque; the Spanish have killed a Spaniard; Europeans have killed a European."
"Yes, unfortunately Europeans, direct descendants of the tyrants who caused anguish to Europe this century, are taking human life or showing no respect for their dignity."
"We Spanish socialists, Mr President, share the sense of pain, of repudiation and also of hope which my colleague has expressed."
"In this case we share with the family and the fellow countrymen of JosÃ© Ignacio Iruretagoyena, with the members of the Popular Party who have been attacked themselves, with all the other democratic parties who have felt this death as their own, with the Basque town councils and those in the rest of Spain."
"Anyone who has represented his electorate - as I have done - for many years on a town council can easily imagine the force and generosity Iruretagoyena employed to resolve everyone's problems."
"We share these problems with the Basques and the rest of the Spanish people, and we are sure that this resolution will help us to share the values of our European colleagues, as we share with them the values against which ETA and Herri Batasuma fight, that is respect for life and defence of freedom, which make up the soul of Europe."
"Mr President, the acts of terrorism in Spain, especially in the Basque Country which I myself know particularly well and which really is one of the most beautiful and best provinces of Spain, have shown that here a terrorist organization is working against its own people and is murdering representatives of that people."
"I therefore believe that is important for us as Europeans not just to show our solidarity, but also to discuss the matter and to expect our governments to organise an international campaign, not directed against the Basque people and Spain but, on the contrary, designed to defend these people against further campaigns."
"What is taking place there at the moment will - and we should not forget this - also have an effect on us if we do combine our democratic powers in time to square up to this terrorism."
"Mr President, firstly, on behalf of my Party, I would like to join in the expressions of solidarity with the family, colleagues and friends of JosÃ© Ignacio Iruretagoyena."
"These words of condolence have become - sadly - commonplace, as a display of solidarity with the victims of terrorist violence in Euskadi and an expression of repulsion at the same."
"A violence that you, Mr President, know well through having presided over the Parliamentary delegation which was in Euskadi and where it could verify that terrorist violence is not a local problem but a European problem."
"As has been said here, the voice of a people may be drowned out by the noise of weapons."
"From this Parliament, as one more representative of the citizen's voice, we condemn without any reservations whatsoever this attack and we reiterate our absolute rejection of any type of violence."
"Once again and for all those who need it, because in doing so we exercise the European right to freedom, to democracy, which we will not renounce under any circumstances."
"But our involvement is not limited to condemning attacks in debates like these, it goes beyond demanding what has been agreed in other full sessions."
"In this Parliament we will reject dialogue with all those who collaborate, allow, support and carry out criminal acts."
"Because any tolerance to these criminal attacks helps them to be repeated."
"We support the peace-keeping of Euskadi and we support peace-keeping in Europe."
"Because peace-keeping in Euskadi is peace-keeping in Europe."
"Mr President, with criminal obstinacy, the ETA continues to assassinate anyone who disagrees with its aims or methods."
"Local elected representatives seem to have been their preferred target, in the last few months."
"Let this Parliament show not the least indulgence or understanding with regard to ETA assassins and torturers."
"There is absolutely nothing to justify the crimes they commit."
"However, public opinion and the media, which are sometimes ambiguous, sometimes blinded by emotion, seem from time to time to condemn the close collaboration between the French Police, the Basque Autonomous Police and the Spanish Police."
"In this respect, we must be quite clear and make sure the message gets through."
"Cooperation to track down and punish crime will continue to increase."
"Those whose so-called military action is to shoot an obviously unarmed and unprotected local councillor in the head should look out!"
"Democracy is of course vulnerable, but in Europe, until now, it has won every battle against the tyranny of small groups who attempt to impose their ideology or their vision of the world by violent means."
"This House supports, and will continue to support the Basque people and their elected representatives, and will not make any concessions with the enemies of freedom."
"Mr President, a young man, JosÃ© Ignacio Iruretagoyena, has been murdered by the barbaric behaviour of ETA."
"Once again a family has been destroyed and a people struggling for freedom and wanting peace, as are the Basque people, have been attacked while carrying out their public duties."
"The Franquist dictatorship could not silence the voice of our people and the people who try to impose their will by means of violence are not going to succeed either, because in history the people's will, freedom and democracy always triumph over pistols."
"And the support of the Basque people, the vast majority of their citizens, for these values is undeniable."
"We wish to demonstrate solidarity with the family and friends of Iruretagoyena and also our complete solidarity with the Popular Party, a political family to which the murdered man belonged."
"The struggle against violence, the achievement of peace, is everyone's task."
"Therefore we should work, as far as is possible, from an agreement of those who believe in democracy, from this basis of unity."
"And although those who kill do not want this and put up obstacles, we must go with the force of our words to convince those who still support violent men that they have to become involved in democracy."
"Therefore I ask the assembly to vote ""no' on point five of the resolution, which makes these paths difficult and has a unilateral and partisan vision of the road to peace, because they have cut down a human life - which is terrible - but we must not let them kill the hope of a whole nation."
"Let us make peace possible with the weapons we have, without giving up any of them: police operations, democracy and our voice as well."
"Mr President, briefly, just to echo on behalf of the Commission, the horror, the outrage and the sympathy which has been expressed to the relatives of the murdered Basque Councillor."
"Mr President, it makes on think."
"Delegates of the people can also become victims of these kinds of terrorist attacks."
"It is a new impulse towards us all, from the Commission, from the Member States, from the European Union institutions to combat the scourge of terrorism with renewed strength and in unity and solidarity."
"Thank you, Mr Commissioner."
"I should like, as President of this sitting, to abandon my usual neutrality and wholeheartedly approve everything, which has just been said about this dreadful business."
"The joint debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Community aid (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on community aid."
"Mr President, I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteurs, both the main rapporteur and the draftsmen of the opinions of the committees involved in this debate, because this is an important discussion dealing with the quality of the European Union's development cooperation and humanitarian aid."
"It is an important debate because Community cooperation plus the cooperation of the Member States of the European Union, now represents over 50 % of world public development aid, in which the funds under common management through the instruments of Community action have an increasing role, even if only in relative terms."
"Now, when we deal with the issue of effectiveness and evaluation of cooperation and humanitarian aid, we must take account of certain specific characteristics of Community intervention as compared with that of Member States."
"First of all, the fact that, also on the initiative of the European Parliament, primarily through the budget instrument, the Community has carried out an extraordinary diversification in the course of the last few years, both in actions and in partners, both official partners, that is, governments of third countries, and international organizations and agencies, non-governmental organizations, people's organizations, firms and so on."
"Secondly, there is an extremely important diversification of objectives, which should perhaps be reviewed and reorganized but which has also made it possible to intervene on various issues and in various sectors."
"In the third place, the fact that the Community, unlike all the other bilateral donors, now operates in all parts of the world, but also - and I want to emphasize this point - the fact that it is often linked to extremely complex decisionmaking procedures, in which the weight of commitology, intervention and pressure is sometimes excessive and sometimes not brought to a positive conclusion by the Member States, plays a role which is not always positive, in fact often contradictory and negative."
"Finally, the fact that the Commission, and in particular the Directorates-General involved in the international aid, have rather limited staffs which are also tending to decrease."
"In the last few years there has been a process of definition of new legal bases, in particular that for humanitarian aid, which I think resolves many of the comments made by the Court of Auditors regarding the management of humanitarian aid in the period 1992-95."
"There has been and continues to be a process of redefinition of some very important procedures, above all those relating to the ECHO framework contracts and to the new NGO cofinancing conditions, and a process of internal reorganization has started inside the Commission and its departments managing the instruments of external cooperation."
"Frankly, we would like to know a little more about that and we would like to be consulted."
"Certainly, the effectiveness of public development aid is a complex issue, as has been rightly mentioned in the motion for a resolution, and it is made up of intertwined internal and international conditions and not just of the impact of individual projects and individual instruments."
"What we are substantially asking for, and these are the important messages for this debate, is greater integration and coordination between aid managed directly by the Community and Member States' aid, to strengthen the structures and make them more independent, both internally and externally, and responsible for evaluation and quality control. We want the institutional capacity of the Commission in the partnership with the NGOs strengthened, management capacity is improved in developing countries and, above all, Parliament should be fully consulted and fully associated in the Commission's internal reorganization process."
"As regards the functioning of ECHO - as this is the subject of a specific report - in my opinion we should move in the direction of achieving its potential and not towards a watering-down of the functions for which it was created, and, as regards non-governmental organizations, the use of specific criteria for their needs and for the nature of their action must not only be maintained but eventually strengthened."
"Mr President, this is an extremely timely report as we move towards the year 2000."
"A new organization is being put in place to administer aid to the developing countries in the ACP."
"I must congratulate Mr Goerens on the vision he has shown in how to improve the effectiveness of Community aid to developing nations."
"I say 'timely' because, if one looks back and sees that between ECU 40 billions and 50 billions have been spent in aid since 1975, yet many applicant countries are worse off today than they were at the start of LomÃ©, something must be wrong with the system."
"There are many reasons for this: instability of governments, corruption and, in many cases, countries carrying a debt burden that they simply will never recover from."
"With many nations cutting bilateral aid and a constant squeeze on EU funding, it is therefore vital that available finance is made better use of."
"There is, I believe, a real need for a regional approach to get a better integration of projects to make sure aid is not spread so thinly that it is not being effective."
"There are many ways better use can be made of existing funds."
"There needs to be a relaxation of the rules to allow EU delegates on the ground to have more say in decision-making powers."
"They know the local problems and the solutions without constant referral back to Brussels."
"Delegates could organize much better coordination of bilateral aid and Community aid to save duplication."
"This would improve the impact - the spending power - and would allow for proper, detailed feasibility studies and impact studies to be done to monitor the situation more closely."
"There are many instances where no environmental impact study has been done, with consequential damage to the ecology of the area."
"The report also calls for the principle of conditionality to be applied."
"I support this."
"Democracy, a respect for human rights and minimum standards of efficiency and transparency in financial management should be a prerequisite for financial aid."
"Developing nations must trade their way out of financial problems."
"Only if we have stable and good governments will outside investors help to create the environment to allow industrial development."
"Africa is the next logical continent for such development."
"Many developing nations do not have the capacity at local levels to carry out major development programmes."
"I see a real opportunity to second personnel from Europe to help with this work."
"This is a well-balanced report and has many specific proposals, which I hope the Commission will not only look at, but will act upon."
"My group fully supports this report."
"Mr President, we are today discussing an excellent report on Community development aid and its effectiveness."
"Mr Goerens must be wholeheartedly congratulated on his splendid work."
"Our group fully supports the report's proposals and I wish to just underline the importance of a few points in the resolution."
"First, I think it is important that the rapporteur has proposed drawing the Commission's attention to factors of gender in programmes of cooperation."
"The participation of women is key to the success of the development process."
"And their involvement means, above everything else, education."
"This is in fact the best and most effective sort of development aid we can give."
"The connection between education for women and the birth rate is obvious."
"Population growth can be slowed down only by educating women in ways of regulating child birth."
"With education and some kind of credit aid women could also be encouraged to start their own ventures so they will have greater independence in, and a genuine influence on, the economic development process."
"Another vital point in the resolution, I think, is to stress the principles of partnership and involvement in development."
"Local workers, organizers and beneficiaries must all get involved if we want results."
"This is demonstrated in very many successful cases, for example in the framework of the Phare programme."
"It is also right to demand greater democracy where appropriate and a respect for human rights, together with greater openness and efficiency in handling the economy, as conditions of aid."
"At least an attempt to improve the situation should be evident."
"Despite the problems, however, it is essential to help local organizations to cope in difficult circumstances."
"To improve the effectiveness of Community aid a lot can certainly also be done by making the tasks of the different sectors more compatible with each other, given that they all have the same objective anyway."
"National and EU initiatives must also be better coordinated."
"At their best they can be complementary, rather than overlap, and their aspirations may more easily be realized."
"Evalution is naturally the key tool in improved effectiveness."
"If the aims and objectives of projects are clear, they can be assessed meaningfully."
"Mere assessment is not enough, though, and it is important to have data on results, if they are to have any effect."
"Furthermore, it is necessary to exchange experiences more often, and perhaps this should be the concern of the central processing unit mentioned in the motion."
"Mr President, as always Mr Goerens has submitted a report which is well thought through and full of ideas."
"It is also timely, as a reorganization of development policy is in the pipeline."
"But what is the point of such good reports if the framework conditions of the policy aren't right?"
"We are confronted with more and more catastrophes, more and more famines, more and more natural disasters. The issue of development policy is becoming more and more urgent."
"Here in the House, however, we have a situation whereby every year in the budget process we have to fight for funding cuts not to be implemented, just to hold on to the previous year's funding levels."
"In addition, every year we are faced with the problem of under-staffing within the Commission."
"When I was budget rapporteur two years ago, the Commission promised to recruit more personnel in DG VIII for NGOs."
"I believe that the work of the NGOs is of vital importance, particularly for development policy and with regard to efficiency."
"They are opinion formers, they know their business, they are based on the ground."
"But there aren't enough staff to be able to work really efficiently."
"I have just received a whingeing letter from the pharmaceutical campaign in Germany."
"They have had to cut three positions because they have not received funding from the Commission."
"It's the same story for Mozambique, a cultural event this weekend, or next week in Frankfurt."
"And it's no help if personnel are sent abroad, if aid is delivered in the countries themselves."
"I believe that the Commission must organise things itself."
"It's European development aid and I hope that this will change over the next few years, that we really will become efficient, irrespective of the political framework."
"I hope that the burden of debt will stop pushing the countries of the third world further onto their knees, with an unbridled world finance policy, as we are witnessing in South East Asia, making the global market an ever wilder place while we are forced to watch famines and natural disasters."
"Mr President, this will not sound very original, because I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent and very comprehensive work, and say that the Group of the European Radical Alliance absolutely shares his point of view on budgetarization of the EDF, on improving the visibility of European aid and its political advantages, on internal coherence, which is still inadequate, between the instruments and various types of action, and our various areas of intervention, and finally on ensuring that the development aid policy and other European policies are more complementary!"
"We are in complete agreement with the report and with the motion for a resolution, on all these points."
"On the other hand, and I already expressed concern on this during the examination of the report made by Mr McGowan on a similar subject, I do not believe that the priority is to make European aid and national aid more complementary."
"What is a priority, what is really urgent, in our opinion, is to put aside neo-colonialism, which is often disguised as bilateral cooperation, and to progress resolutely towards the total inclusion of development policy in the policies of the Community."
"A majority of us here are committed to the idea of institutional progress of the EU and even greater integration of the main areas of public action."
"The European Union is furthermore still looking for a real foreign policy and cannot speak in a single voice on the main questions of interest to international society."
"Now we have before us, in development aid, a vast terrain in which the political project of a Europe based on common humanist values could finally find a practical dimension."
"Beyond historical and cultural, almost anecdotal divergences, or short-term false calculations, there is no opposition of interests amongst Europeans on this subject."
"I would also like to stress this in my capacity as an elected representative of France, and furthermore to express my delight that the President of this sitting is a former French Cooperation Minister."
"I would like to stress this in my capacity as an elected representative of France, because it is necessary to recognise that the communitarization of development aid is a thousand miles from the habits, present practice and even the revised doctrine of France."
"However, I think that France, taken here as a simple example, would have everything to gain from putting its experience and cooperation resources into the kitty of European aid, so that they can have a significant dimension."
"There are a thousand reasons - humanitarian and financial - in favour of doing so."
"But if I could only choose one, I would chose the cynical point of view so often expressed, in order to refute it."
"What is the national interest, in terms of political influence or economic returns?"
"It is my conviction that, if France's influence is not quickly supported by the impact of the European Union, it will disappear behind the influence of the United States of America, as several recent problems have shown. So, even though my point of view may now appear rather utopian, and I am aware of this, I would like to say very resolutely to French leaders: it is in the interests of France to give up its little bilateral policy and to become a part of the greater undertaking of European development aid."
"Mr President, in the necessary endeavours to make EU aid more effective the keyword should be optimization, but examples of a lack of effectiveness must not give grounds for reductions in aid."
"There are unfortunately many other forces aiming for that."
"I applaud many of Mr Goerens' proposals."
"The changeover to sector-specific analysis means a necessary focusing which also shows the priorities in the recipient countries more clearly."
"With the intake of new projects we are shooting randomly from the hip."
"Furthermore, it is absolutely necessary to have good pilot studies, increased involvement of NGOs and recipient countries and improvements in capacity in the recipient countries."
"Nor should the Commission's problems with undermanning be doubted."
"Cohesion in the EU's policies and coordination between the Member States also promote effectiveness."
"Coordination is beneficial, but the word samordning (coordination) has the wrong overtones."
"EU aid should be a supplement to aid from the Member States, even if it has its own justifications."
"The wording of paragraph 5 is therefore unfortunate."
"The evaluation requirements are too different and so the Member States should not subject themselves to the EU's methods, even if a rapprochement makes sense."
"I must also oppose the idea of separating the political decision-making from the project management tasks."
"The organizational problems have to be solved in another way, as has already been started."
"Even though I am definitely not a spokesman for committees, I am convinced that the Council's management committees have hardly anything to do with delays in implementation."
"On the contrary, these management committees are a quality check."
"It is hardly likely that there would have been improvements on the current scale with regard to the integration of gender or environmental aspects, if it had not been thanks to constant pressure from the Member States on these committees and from this Parliament."
"Furthermore, the reference to food aid in paragraph 7 is unfortunate because the assessment of this was highly critical and will lead to this kind of aid being restricted."
"Mr President, this is a very wide-ranging report and there is much in it with which to agree, including the need for a comparative evaluation between EU development projects and those of individual Member States, our long-running demands for budgetization of the EDF, and the need to publicize the very many positive achievements of European aid programmes."
"One omission, which Mr Vecchi referred to, is the expensive, wasteful, secretive and time-consuming operation of comitology procedures, which most certainly diminish rather than enhance the quality of our aid."
"However, let me concentrate on two points in the report."
"First, let us understand the inconsistencies within European development programmes because of the geographical distribution of responsibilities within the Commission."
"Whether a project is in the Horn of Africa, the mountains of Nepal or the Brazilian rainforest, all our aid should observe a common, rights-based approach consistent with acknowledged human rights standards."
"Such principles include due diligence, non-discrimination, advisability, participation and accountability."
"When things go wrong, there is a need for redress."
"I ask the Commissioner to consider how far existing arrangements enable him to be confident that such standards are upheld in all cases."
"Second, I agree with my many colleagues who have pointed to the chronic problem of under-staffing within the Commission."
"This causes its staff to engage in the quaintly titled 'stuffing' with its concentration on large projects to reach budget targets with too little regard for quality."
"Last year a third of senior management posts in DG IB, dealing with Asia and Latin America, remained vacant; 40 % of staff in DG I, IA and IB are on short-term contracts, whilst a large number of core tasks are carried out by external consultants."
"Britain and Germany employ more than double the staff numbers, pound for pound, mark for mark, in managing their aid programmes."
"Until Member States jointly agree a solution to the staffing problem in the Commission, resolutions in favour of aid quality will go little further than the paper on which they are written."
"Mr President, the Goerens report primarily concerns measures the European Union can take to improve the effectiveness of development aid."
"We can agree with the proposed measures in itself, but the European Commission's Green Paper lays the cause of the poor effectiveness first and foremost at the door of the developing countries themselves."
"If the Commission's analysis is right, the feasibility studies and impact evaluations within the Union will not improve the effectiveness of aid, but measures will have to be taken first of all in the developing countries themselves."
"To my mind, this concept is not conveyed clearly enough in the Goerens report."
"I support the plea in the Fabra VallÃ©s report for improved harmony between European humanitarian aid and that of the Member States."
"The European Commission can play a coordinating role in this."
"But a European charter with general principles for development cooperation policy is something I can do without."
"Especially where more structural development aid is concerned, preference should be given to the aid programmes from the Member States."
"Many European countries have special relations with certain developing countries."
"The Union should respect these special links."
"In this context it is remarkable that the Member States are unilaterally blamed for this poor cooperation."
"They are alleged to make insufficient use of the expertise of the Commission services."
"This may be so, but can we not reverse the issue with equal justification, Has the Commission made sufficient use of the knowledge and experience of the Member States?"
"It seems to me, as a result of their long-standing relations with certain developing countries, the Member States have acquired a wealth of experience, from which an office like ECHO, which with its six years is only just beginning to find its feet, has a lot to learn."
"Mr President, I am speaking only to the Fabra VallÃ©s report as a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I would like first of all to remind Parliament that this report is about ensuring that European Union money is spent in the best possible way."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control is not trying at all to usurp the role of the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"After all, the report is the Committee on Budgetary Control's response to the special report by the Court of Auditors."
"Some would say that this is just the committee siding with the Court against the Commission."
"It is no such thing."
"It is a serious attempt to get some common sense into what is a very complicated system."
"The system has many good points which we should, and do, praise in the explanatory statement."
"But it still has failings as far as our committee is concerned."
"The Fabra VallÃ©s report is an attempt to bring closer together the expertise, the experience and the best practices, not only of the European Union but also of the Member States to replace the present sixteen different and uncoordinated systems."
"Let us not forget that we are talking about humanitarian aid, not development aid in total."
"When we talk of humanitarian aid, I am reminded of when I was in Addis Ababa before the fall of Mengistu regime."
"It was a time when Ethiopia was the centre of world attention for a variety of reasons."
"One senior Ethiopian official said to me: ' The trouble with you Europeans is that your own vested interest seems to be your priority."
"You do not consult with us as to what we really want."
"You try to ensure that what you want to give us are the things we need' ."
"And he gave me an example. 'When we needed transport to move water and food around, the Member States of the Union were very good."
"The Germans gave us lorries, they gave us Mercedes Benz."
"The French gave us lorries, they gave us Renaults."
"The Italians gave us lorries, they gave us Fiats."
"And the British gave us lorries, they gave us Leylands."
"What they did not give us was any training for our motor mechanics or spare parts."
"We had a fleet of lorries all with different needs and a lot of them were no use to us' ."
"He also said: ' The day that Bob Geldorf came riding into Addis Abbaba on top of a lorry bringing in his food aid convoy, my heart sank."
"I looked at the lorry he was sitting on and I thought: that is another one we do not have' ."
"That true anecdote says a lot about the lack of coordination and cooperation between the Member States and the Union."
"That is what the Fabra VallÃ©s report recognizes."
"It is understandable why the Member States do this."
"They do have vested interests."
"But at the end of the day that is not the best for humanitarian aid."
"I know it will take a mighty effort to move things along but this is what the report is trying to do."
"It is not an attack on the Commission per se - let us get that straight."
"As much as anything, it is about getting the Member States to realize that subsidiarity is not always about moving things down a level, it is about doing things at the right level."
"When it comes to humanitarian aid, subsidiarity may well mean bringing it up a level and having it coordinated at Community level rather than Member States trying to do it in a devolved way."
"My worry is that when we have voted on this, it will remain on a shelf somewhere doing nothing."
"That is why I make a plea to the Commission to act upon this report, especially on paragraphs 4 and 7 where we ask for specific action from the Commission."
"That is about making a political statement to get real action: not just to bring another regulation forward, but to start doing something."
"If we can get our act together between the Member States and the Commission, just imagine what we could do with all the money."
"It would be far better spent."
"Mr President, in this debate on the effectiveness of European Union aid to developing countries and on the much-needed extra aid to developing countries with heavy debts, we have to establish that these themes are very closely related."
"After all, poor countries which are weighed down by unbearably high debts, and as a result have to hand over far too much of their yearly budget to interest payments, have far too little money to implement their own policy, and are therefore becoming poorer and poorer, become more dependent on aid, from the Union amongst others."
"It is therefore a very good thing that the Union is cooperating in a World Bank and IMF initiative to relieve deb."
"This was the first point I wanted to make."
"It seems to me important in this context that agreements are made with the countries to prevent them from getting into debt again, or to prevent them from running up new debts in the expectation that, sooner or later, these will be written off."
"I would like to know from the Commission whether these guarantees will be given."
"Mr President, my comment is particularly aimed at the Goerens report on the effectiveness of aid."
"In my belief you cannot paint a black and white picture here."
"The reality is that in some cases, aid has had a positive effect, in others it did not, and this is by no means always to do with the quality of the aid; it can also be to do with other things, such as natural disasters, bad management, political destabilization or wars."
"That does not alter the fact that it is always good to maximize the effectiveness of aid, and that is why we think the following five points are important."
"Aid should not be parachuted in."
"It should fit in, as one of the previous speakers has said, with the nature and circumstances of the country concerned, and there must be maximum involvement on the part of the population."
"Otherwise so-called white elephants are created."
"These are projects which are put down somewhere and are never used again."
"Donors must coordinate the aid programmes effectively, so that everyone supports each other, and is not working at cross purposes."
"The multitude of NGO programmes from the various western countries, from the World Bank, the IMF, and the UN sometimes create such a chaotic picture of each country that it is no wonder that joint implementation is not effective; and harmonization at EC level is extremely important."
"Sound and democratic management with respect for minorities and human rights is also a necessary condition to increase the effectiveness of aid."
"If this is not achieved, we must have the courage to suspend the aid."
"This obviously does not mean that no more humanitarian aid can be given, but that genuine development aid is simply no longer an option."
"Aid must stimulate people to take matters in hand themselves, and should not become a habit."
"In a number of countries too much aid has been disastrous."
"Think of a country like Zambia which was dependent on development aid for three quarters of its income."
"Finally, when receiving aid, a country should be open to the principles of the social market economy; not to force an ideology on a country, but to help a it chose a positive path in a globalizing world."
"Mr President, these are a number of elements to strengthen effectiveness; whether they are laid down in a charter or in other rules is not all that important to us."
"Yet we think it is important that these kind of principles are transferred into policy."
"We would like to express our thanks for the Goerens report and we would like to wish Commissioner Pinheiro luck with the implementation of the policy, and I wonder if could ask Mr van den Broek to convey these messages to Mr Pinheiro."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a working document recently distributed by our Budget Committee on SEM 2000, our colleague Mr Colom i Naval states that direct financing by the European Commission should represent an example of transparency, good practice and efficiency."
"Unfortunately, this is not often the case."
"I should like to point out, in reference to Mrs Fabra VallÃ©s' report - which I think is very good - that this is a comment which we always make in our reports on foreign affairs aid programmes."
"Reading the Fabra VallÃ©s report, one could draw exactly the same conclusions as Mrs Hoff writing about the problems facing the Tacis programme: poor co-ordination and muddled division of responsibility between the Commission and the foreign aid organizations, consultants, contractors and Ukrainian partner organizations."
"All this applies to a large extent to the criticisms made by the Court of Auditors in relation to the ECHO programme and the Union's aid programme, if we just leave out the work Ukrainian."
"I find this particularly regrettable as it is a problem which we are constantly bringing to the attention of to the Commission."
"There is really no reason why we should have to read exactly the same thing in the Frankfurter Allgemeiner of 14th January, in relation to the evaluation of the EU aid programme in Bosnia, knowing that a large part of our funds have gone to ex-Yugoslavia. I quote: the evaluation of the EU aid programme ranged from not good, through terrible to dangerous."
"This is the assessment of our aid work, so generous in financial terms, which the European public is communicating to our fellow citizens."
"Therefore, I should like to request most energetically that Point 16 of the report, the demand that we should at long last create a central unit to take overall control of the evaluation of the development and aid programme, including ECHO, MEDA, Phare and TACI, that this matter be addressed by the Commission once and for all and in a determined manner."
"This means looking much more closely at Point 14 in which Mrs Fabra VallÃ©s states that we must finally stop recruiting personnel freely when we know that in some cases there are very close relationships between the services in question and certain aid organizations."
"You are aware that every third ECU spent through non-governmental organizations is administered by French aid organizations."
"When these things are viewed in this light, we would also be making a contribution to transparency and the successful implementation of this aid programme if we were to fall in line with our esteemed rapporteur on this point."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate rapporteur Fabra VallÃ©s and Goerens on their reports which are before us."
"Would you allow me to start by responding to the Fabra VallÃ©s report, followed by the Goerens report."
"I do not only want to thank the rapporteur and the draughtsman for the opinion, Mrs Carlotti, for this report, but I would also like to express my appreciation for the constructive contribution from the members of the relevant Parliamentary Committees concerning the recommendations from the Court of Auditors in this report on humanitarian aid for the period 1992-1995."
"The various constructive exchanges have enriched the discussion by introducing ideas towards the future of humanitarian aid."
"The Commission shares most of the findings as expressed in draft resolution, and in particular the necessity to improve the coordination between the various agents in the field of humanitarian aid, including the Member States."
"Also because it is important to provide the experts in this field with their own framework on account of their important coordinating and monitoring role."
"With this in mind the Commission is in the process developing a frame of reference in the shape of a handbook."
"The desirability of providing humanitarian aid with a legal basis in primary law."
"The Commission regrets that the Treaty of Amsterdam has not been able to include these specific measures in the very important domains of the Union's foreign relations."
"Then the necessity to develop, particularly in the event of major humanitarian crises, strategic relations with the other agents in the field of humanitarian aid, both governmental and non-governmental organizations, and United Nations agencies."
"I would like to point out to you that at the moment the Commission is working on a definition of a new effective partnership to optimize the results from humanitarian operations."
"Moreover, the Commission is researching the possibilities of how to improve the evaluation of the effects of humanitarian actions."
"But I should also like to respond to two recommendations in the draft resolution, in which the Commission does not share the opinion of the European Parliament."
"We do not think it is necessary to develop a humanitarian charter in order to define the directions and principles of the Union's humanitarian policy."
"The Council's regulation of 29 June 1996, but also the Commission's statement on the link between humanitarian aid, rehabilitation and development rectifies this deficiency, we believe, and is also a clear legal framework."
"I also believe that Mrs Carlotti, the draughtsman for the opinion of the Committee on Development, also shares the Commission's opinion on this issue."
"When, for that matter, the Court of Auditors drafted its report, this was not yet the case, that is to say, the Commission had not made its statement about the link between humanitarian aid, rehabilitation and development."
"Which is why the report cannot discuss it."
"Concerning the creation of a central unit within the Commission entrusted with the evaluation of the external support programmes, ECHO, MEDA, Phare and Tacis, I would like to point out that on 15 October last year the Commission decided to establish a new structure for the management and evaluation of these programmes."
"The involvement of the humanitarian bureau in this structure will be limited because of the specific nature of humanitarian aid and because of the urgent circumstances and the special procedures necessary for the implementation of these projects."
"To conclude, the Commission will keep the European Parliament informed of the debate to be started soon on humanitarian aid towards the year 2000, so that your institution will remain well-informed on the topics of general interest which require special attention, such as the security of humanitarian personnel, or humanitarian ethics."
"It goes without saying that the Commission will continue to inform this Parliament on the activities undertaken, both in relation to the operations and responsible agents, and in relation to the evaluation of the results."
"In this respect the Commission thinks it will soon be able to the present the report for 1997 to the relevant Parliamentary Committee, both to take stock and to think about what the general focus for the coming year should be."
"I would like to add a couple of remarks to this."
"Firstly, various honourable delegates have talked about the staffing situation within the Commission, and particularly those who are responsible for setting up and implementing aid programmes."
"This is a discussion which recurs every year, and every year in the reports of the Court of Auditors we can read the comment that if nothing is done about this staffing situation, it will no doubt feel obliged to repeat the same comment again."
"It is true."
"If one compares the staff resources available in some of the Member States, as well as in other organizations responsible for foreign aid, then it shows the Commission in a disadvantaged position by a factor of 3 or 4 to 1."
"Germany, for example has 5.7 members of staff for every expenditure of 10 million dollars, whereas we have 2.7."
"We can complain about this."
"We can then say that the whole system of recruiting experts for three year contracts naturally promotes fast turnover."
"We are not authorized to extend these contracts, so in other words, know-how also flushes through quickly."
"At the same time a restriction is imposed on us when it concerns expanding the permanent pool of staff within the Commission."
"I would like to say, make the best of it."
"Let us therefore try to carry out the work as well as possible with the staff resources we have, and not moan too much about having too few staff."
"There is not an awful lot that can be done about that."
"But one can be critical about the recruitment of staff and its quality."
"My second remark, before I respond to the report by Mr Goerens, is to do with the so-called programme approach which has also been argued for."
"The Commission in fact shares the opinion that it would be opportune to opt for a more global approach, and particularly in cases in which there are crises that, because of their significance and complexity, are of a longer duration, and where the issue is not so much an ad-hoc intervention, but more a structural intervention."
"Nonetheless, the Commission believes that the individual project approach, in particular in the context of crises resulting from natural disasters and the like, or sudden epidemics, continues to be preferable."
"So in other words, a more global approach is not ruled out, but in the majority of cases, preference will have to be given to a per-project approach, and less to a, shall we say, programmatic approach."
"I noted another comment about a complaint that certain non-governmental organizations from a certain Member State are given less opportunity than others to participate in the implementation of programmes."
"Let me say briefly and to the point: I have this experience myself with these kind of comments when they are made about the Tacis and Phare aid programmes."
"I can only say that the efficiency and quality of the implementation must be the deciding factor when aid projects are allocated."
"On that matter, I think that it should also remain the starting point, if all are to benefit."
"If there are Member States or companies who are less familiar with the region of the countries where implementation is being carried out, and because of this circumstance, qualify less highly, for instance, when submitting a tender for projects, then something can be done about this disadvantage by means of workshops or information given by the Commission."
"But I am always ready to have an open discussion, and I am not very convinced that the complaints uttered on this point are always equally justified and well-founded."
"Mr Goeren's draft resolution and report."
"The Commission is pleased with the draft resolution, in which the necessity to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our aid programmes is constantly underlined."
"This necessity has long been recognized by us, and many studies have been done to determine the effectiveness of aid."
"These show clearly that aid is efficient when it is intended to support a sound development policy, and to replace such a policy."
"This remark was also made in the debate tonight, and quite rightly."
"Aid cannot take the place of sound economic management, cannot take the place of respecting human rights, and a free democracy."
"Aid flows can only be effective if our partner countries ensure that there is the right economic, social and political framework for development."
"Over the years we have made steady progress integrating this principle into our programming procedures."
"In LomÃ© III, the concentration of programmable aid was already introduced in a limited number of areas or sectors."
"This principle has been carried out more and more during the past decades."
"During the past years, the procedures for drawing up and evaluating activities financed by us have become more elaborate, but also more systematic."
"The draft resolution before you refers, quite rightly to my mind, to the use of a logical framework during all phases of the project cycle."
"The draft resolution also emphasizes certain themes which are going to play an increasingly important role in aid policy, and in the methodology of drawing up of projects."
"Within the Directorate General VIII, a quality support group has been set up which sees to it that the funding proposals submitted are consistent with such a policy."
"The draft resolution notes that the Commission's activities are limited to a large extent by staff shortages."
"There it is again."
"Europe can have its own voice, play an important role in the international debate on the effectiveness of aid. But then we must enough staff at our disposal to give this role some substance."
"I commented on this earlier, but also pointed out its limitations."
"After the discussions with the Member States in 1995 comprehensive evaluations of all our cooperation activities with the poorer world were carried out."
"In most cases the preparatory phase has been completed and the fieldwork is ready to be launched."
"The results will probably be available at the end of the year."
"As I mentioned earlier during discussion of the Fabra VallÃ©s report, in the near future the new structure for the external aid programmes will also play an essential part in this process."
"This was also raised in the Fabra VallÃ©s report, but I would like to underline once more the importance of intensive coordination between all donors, but above all between the Member States and the Commission."
"I fear that this coordination, and I say this with reference to the comments made by Mr Blokland, is only too often one-way traffic, whereby the flow of information travels exclusively from the Commission to the Member States."
"Within the European Union we should be able to improve mutual cooperation, not only to show a more distinct political profile to our partner countries, but also to increase the success rate of our aid."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to respond briefly to a comment made about aid to the former Yugoslavia in particular."
"This is indeed a separate story."
"I will not go into any detail, but in view of the fact that the Frankfurter Allgemeine has in its possession an internal evaluation report submitted by my services, as well as a report which we had contracted out to the consultancy Bereschot, I would like to say that during the past six months, and also as result of the discussions which we have had with Parliament and other donors, we have been working to see how we can make the aid, in particular to Yugoslavia, the redevelopment aid, better and more efficient."
"I shall gladly take responsibility for the delays which have occurred as result of the way we organize our work."
"I hope you will understand that, in Bosnia, we are largely dependent on the cooperation of the authorities."
"Which reminds me."
"The months we have had to wait for approval, authorization, signatures of memoranda of understanding with the authorities, are countless."
"Nevertheless, we are strengthening our delegation in Sarajevo, have gone over our organization in Brussels with a fine tooth comb once again, and have a proposal which will be sent to the Council next week, for which we will request your cooperation soon, to make the regulations referring to reconstruction aid to Yugoslavia more flexible, which will give us more scope to work faster."
"Because there is one thing you should not forget. We work on the basis of legal regulations which in fact have been aid down by the Council, and which contain a host of elements intended to guarantee complete transparency on the one hand, but at the same time mean extremely time consuming procedures."
"This is another element in the delay in the implementation of aid."
"To conclude, I will promise Mrs Maij that I will wish Mr Pinheiro all necessary success with his programmes, in particular for the ACP countries."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.15 p.m.) ."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the Agenda."
"Yesterday the Agenda stated quite clearly that after Urgencies, voting starts at 5.30 p.m."
"As Members are now going to be electronically tagged as from February, I would very much suggest that this House tries to bring some discipline into voting time."
"A lot of Members had to leave yesterday at 6 p.m. when voting should have finished."
"Therefore I would ask that in future we start to try to keep some discipline about time."
"Thank you very much, Mr Sturdy, but your comments do not refer to the Minutes."
"However, we will take note of the comments and forward them to the Committee."
"Mr President, my name does not appear on the list of Members present yesterday, although I do appear on every list of recorded votes."
"I would be grateful if that could be put right."
"Thank you, Mrs Hardstaff."
"You are right."
"The corresponding Minutes will be put right."
"Mr President, that also applies to me."
"My name is not shown, although I took part in every vote and attended the Conference of Presidents."
"Thank you very much, Mr Pasty."
"I repeat what I have already said to Mrs Hardstaff."
"You are right, and the Minutes will be put right."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Votes"
"Mr President, this motion corresponds to the fundamental view which this Chamber and above all the committee have always had, and I shall therefore support this motion."
"Mr President, it is by no means clear to me what this means."
"What has transit through Ireland got to do with Switzerland, for instance?"
"It strikes me as superfluous."
"Mr Wijsenbeek is opposed to the oral amendment."
"Are there 12 members of Parliament who are opposed to this oral amendment?"
"(Since there are not 12 members of Parliament who are opposed to the oral amendment, the President puts it to the vote)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, please excuse me for speaking very briefly about what I find in the Minutes."
"It has unfortunately been somewhat misrepresented."
"It says here that I started a competition for the most stupid pub language."
"Obviously, this did not refer to the German Members and not to all PPE Members."
"I must say, to save my honour, that it referred to only two Members, who tried to practise mediaeval politics in modern Europe, like robber barons."
"Second point: this megatunnel, about which I spoke, is unfortunately not 20 km long but 50 km."
"That is just the problem, that this tragic tube is so long and impracticable."
"Excuse me for interfering, but it was important to me."
"I sincerely hope agreement can be reached on Alpine transit."
"We have to admit that our Swiss neighbours have expressed concern for environment, which is now widely shared in all the Alpine areas involved."
"We could do nothing worse than to cast all the polluting traffic back at our neighbours by increasingly adopting unilateral measures."
"The long-term solution is combined transport, not only through the Swiss tunnels, but also through the Brenner Pass and the FrÃ©jus Tunnel between France and Italy."
"Priority funding within the framework of the main European networks and a construction timetable are essential."
"Adopting these would improve the relationship between Switzerland and the European Community, by means of the joint definition of a solution, which would respect the interests of the populations involved and of the Alps, which form a part of the European heritage."
"The current negotiations between the EU and Switzerland give cause for concern."
"I think the EU should show more respect for Switzerland's position, especially with regard to the protection of the Alpine environment."
"Against the background of the European Commission's Green Paper on the effect of traffic on the environment and the White Paper on the future development of a common transport policy, people have repeatedly explained the necessity of making the EU's transport policy environmentally suitable."
"It is now time for the Commission to turn these fine words into practical policies. the EU should therefore adopt the position of making an especially large effort to reduce air pollution by switching transit traffic through the Alps to the railways."
"The EU should also support the Swiss proposal for performance-related tolls for heavy traffic and a special transit toll for traffic through the Alps, so that the objective of switching shipments to the railways can really be achieved."
"An expansion of motorways in the Alpine region would therefore not be necessary."
"Instead there should be an immediate expansion of the railways."
"Goerens report (A4-0388/97)"
"Mr Goerens' report is good. I approve of its main outline."
"I agree with the idea of involving beneficiaries and NGOs in the programmes."
"A measure of that sort contributes towards greater transparency and will improve the management of the funds allocated to humanitarian aid."
"In that respect, I support the creation of a central unit to evaluate development aid programmes."
"I consider that the unit should work in close cooperation with the NGOs on the pertinence of the actions undertaken."
"Internal management of projects is also desirable in order to prevent the inertia inherent in any division of tasks."
"With regard to Mr Goerens' proposal and the content, I should like to raise an objection and a question."
"In fact, I question the concept of 'economic and social value' ."
"What is the reality behind this?"
"It seems to me important that NGOs should be involved in the creation of coherent indicators, legitimized by themselves."
"We shall be able to see more clearly and the quality of future decisions will be improved."
"This reflection on the efficiency of community aid is helpful, but we must take care not to adopt a long and complicated approach."
"Let us never forget that our final aim is to create balanced forms of development suitable for each country and each area."
"Humanitarian aid must make it possible to look forward to the time when people no longer need it."
"We will have succeeded when it is no longer needed, that is, when humanitarian aid has disappeared."
"The European Union and its Member States are the largest providers of Third World aid."
"Our contributions far exceed those of the USA or Japan."
"Obviously it is of great importance to those we help and to ourselves to obtain the best possible benefit from this huge effort."
"Despite high levels of unemployment and unacceptable levels of poverty in our own countries there is widespread support for aid to developing countries."
"This is a welcome reflection of the generosity of the ordinary people of Europe."
"Direct aid to governments of the Third World is often wasted through inefficiency and sometimes corruption."
"This method of helping the people of the countries concerned often fails and merely enriches a few government leaders."
"It is the least effective method of aid distribution and should be avoided whenever possible."
"We have seen some very successful European Programmes of aid and we must build on these successes."
"We must also make sure that we can verify that the aid has reached its intended targets."
"Europe has been very successful in its food aid programme."
"Millions of lives have been saved through these efforts and with the high level of expertise that now exists in this area, I am sure that we can build on these successes."
"Emergency aid must be given when and where it is needed, without any conditions."
"However, as regards general development and structural aid, I believe we must insist on the countries concerned agreeing to respect the human rights of all their citizens, including minorities, and promote democracy."
"We cannot allow corrupt and cruel dictatorships to divert aid from the needy into their own pockets."
"Our efforts have not all been successful."
"Imports into Europe from developing countries have declined substantially over the past 20 years or so."
"This phenomenon must be looked at in detail because it is only through trade that poor countries can hope to develop and provide for the needs of their citizens."
"Non-governmental organizations are at the heart of development policy generally."
"NGOs have a very high rate of effectiveness reflecting expertise gained in the field."
"Given the continuing problem with trade flows with developing countries, I believe we should ask the NGOs to examine this area and suggest solutions acceptable to all concerned."
"I welcome the Commission's Green Paper on development aid."
"It clearly identifies the successes and failures of our policies."
"I would like to commend the Commission for this huge contribution to the development of the Third World."
"It has achieved excellent results with limited staff resources."
"Its efforts are appreciated throughout the Third World."
"I am very sceptical towards the idea that the EU should administer the Member State's aid activities."
"Experience so far shows that EU aid goes mainly to former colonies of some of the Member States, which means that certain countries which need help are put into another queue."
"That is regrettable."
"It is however, important to have improved coordination between the EU countries, because that can give better results for the countries/areas which need assistance."
"Improved coordination, without being EU regulated, could also help to reduce the administration costs of the aid providers."
"As far as the problems pointed out by the Court of Auditors in its report are concerned, it is true that there are problems with irregularities."
"We should of course try to avoid these, but we must also have understanding for the fact that it is easy to get irregularities in 'turbulent' areas where the social system has more or less collapsed."
"The aid which the EU currently administers needs to be concentrated more on preventative measures to avoid catastrophes."
"Finally, I am opposed to the rapporteur's argument that 'improved coordination would help to ensure wider recognition of the considerable efforts being made in the development aid field by the Union and the Member States/.../. This fact generally escapes the attention of public opinion.'"
"I do not think that we should try to make political points through aid for people who need help. 'Working without being seen' might be a better watchword."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have just been informed that today it is also Mr TelkÃ¤mper's birthday, for which I wish to congratulate him as I have already congratulated Mrs Fontaine."
"Many happy returns, Mr TelkÃ¤mper."
"Debt relief for heavily indebted ACP countries"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A4-0382/97) by Mr Torres Couto, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the communication from the Commission on support for structural adjustment and debt relief in heavily indebted ACP countries - a Community response to the HIPC debt initiative, together with a proposal for a Council decision concerning Exceptional Assistance for the Heavily Indebted ACP countries (COM(97)0129 - C4-0243/97)"
"I give the floor to Mr Vecchi who is deputizing for Mr Torres Couto as rapporteur."
"Mr President, with today's discussion, the European Parliament intends to express its own satisfaction with the fact that, for the first time, the Commission has been able to launch an initiative to begin concrete intervention into the problem of the multilateral foreign debt of the poorest and mostheavily indebted ACP countries."
"I would like to recall the fact that we are talking about a request which both the European Parliament and the joint ACP-EU assembly made many years ago now, which until today had not met with the support of the Council or the governments of the Member States of the Union."
"It is well-known by everybody that, by the end of the 1970s, the weight of the foreign debt was already having a major effect on the life of very many countries in the southern hemisphere and was actually hindering, and in the majority of cases preventing, the development of the poorest parts of the planet."
"The cost of servicing the debt was and still is, for many countries, the principal expense for the public purse, in hard currency, and this has produced a situation which is the cause of a huge ""negative net transfer ' of financial resources from the South to the North, that is from the poorer to the richer countries."
"Certainly, the debts should be honoured, in principle."
"Of course many of the causes of the failure of the southern countries to develop lie with the maladministration which has characterized many governments and power groups in countries in the third and fourth worlds."
"However, it is also necessary to recall the fact that these governments have often enjoyed the support of governments and political and economic groups in the more developed countries, and that the management of international credit has not always been characterized by honesty and fairness."
"In reality, in many cases, the sums repaid by the countries in the southern hemisphere, in the form of interest payments, are by now much greater than those originally received in the form of loans."
"Furthermore, many of the international factors which have made a major contribution to increasing the debt and the burdens of its management, have certainly not been caused by the countries in the southern hemisphere."
"I recall these elements in order to stress the fact that the initiatives to reduce the weight of the debt are not a free handout, but a compelling necessity which, from many points of view, is intended to reestablish conditions of greater equality."
"It is a matter then of accepting the fact that, under the present conditions, the poorest countries will never be able to pay off their own foreign debt and that, anyway, its persistence or, really, its automatic increase will never make it possible either to tackle seriously the roots of underdevelopment, or less still, to reinstate these countries in the international marketplace and in the dynamics of commercial and economic relations which, furthermore, the European countries have a great interest in doing."
"With today's vote, Parliament will be opening the way for the Union to join the international initiative, promoted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, directed at supporting the structural adjustment and the policies of amortization of the debt, both because it is a positive initiative as a whole - even if it is certainly insufficient - and because we believe that the Union should play an important political role in it."
"It is a good opportunity to demonstrate that this more human and rational approach, which must take account of the priority objectives of the struggle against poverty and human and sustainable development, which we always hammer into our Community documents, can become a point of reference for the major international financial institutions."
"It is a matter then, even with this instrument, of building a strategy of political dialogue and concrete collaboration, which might see the European Union, together with the partners in the southern hemisphere, and in particular the ACP countries, committed to the relaunch of effective policies of cooperation for development."
"The exposure to the Community itself, of the 11 ACP countries for whom the Community initiative provides, is for a relatively small sum."
"The initiative provides for the possibility of the flexible use of various forms of remission, amortization and reduction of the debt."
"Parliament asks the Commission to keep it constantly informed and consulted on future developments in Community action, to which we give our support, which will be conditional upon the aims of democratic reform, development, and justice in which Europe must be the leading player."
"This initiative will have to be the first important step in tackling, in a more comprehensive way, the problems associated with the foreign debt, including the multilateral debt, of the poorest countries on a worldwide level, as a condition for the restoration of the minimum conditions of solvency and economic and financial practicability for many countries in the world."
"In this framework, the role of the Union and its Member States, both directly and in international initiatives, is obviously decisive."
"Mr President, the report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on support for structural adjustment and debt relief in heavily indebted ACP states has received the assent of the Committee on Budgets for obvious reasons."
"It is the most basic common sense, within the framework of cooperation with these countries, to give them the means to start off on the right foot so that all the work they have done - at least as far as some are concerned - is not cancelled out by excessive debts."
"The support we give them by means of this report is therefore intended to provide a lasting answer to their problems, and the European Union, the largest donor to these countries, can act in three ways: by providing additional support for structural adjustment, case by case; by envisaging aid, case by case, to reduce the trade debt and by increasing support for debt management; by taking appropriate measures to reduce the present net amount of the debt of eligible countries to the European Community."
"In practice, Article 3 states that the aid in the form of non-refundable aid referred to in Article 1, will be taken out of a single interest-bearing account, which will be opened for the purpose at the European Investment Bank and which from now on will be called the 'debt relief account' ."
"We would like the Commission to show the amount of the interest earned by that account at the EIB in the financial information on the European Development Fund every year."
"Mr President, this initiative - which this House will undoubtedly approve - should allow us to make a first consideration: how community budget needs to be calculated in the European Development Fund."
"We would insist on this in the proposal for the Union to make its foreign affairs policy more and more united."
"Direct budgetary control of these funds would make the European Union's actions even more efficient."
"What doubt can there be about the demand for a sustained or efficient development, in many cases, the cancellation of a debt when it becomes impossible for a country to repay this debt and the interest payments without putting its future economic development at risk."
"To insist on forcing certain countries to make impossible repayments renders development aid, as well as economic reforms, unviable."
"The high level of debt in some countries has, moreover, a deterrent effect on investment, leads to the flight of capital, makes its production become excessively export-orientated causing imbalances, the abandonment of rural areas and even domestic shortages."
"It also has a knock-on effect on the very political stability of these Third World countries. Let us not talk now about those democracies which are just emerging from what was previously an authoritarian regime."
"Therefore, I think that - as the Committee proposes - maintaining aid to countries like Burundi, Ethiopia, Guinea Bissau, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nigeria, Uganda, SÃ£o TomÃ© e Principe, the former Zaire, Zambia and Uganda is something that this House should support."
"We cannot demand from these Third World countries that they put the repayment of their debt before their own economic growth."
"We have to make sure the debt repayment is compatible with the autonomous development of these countries if we do not want to take with one hand and give with the other, on the basis of increasing humanitarian and development aid."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Union for Europe Group, on whose behalf I am speaking, accepts the EU's participation in the initiative on the debt of the poorest countries launched in 1996, during the G7-Lyons Summit."
"In fact, despite the measures taken to reduce the debt already applied to some of those countries, some of them, mostly situated in Africa, are faced with a level of total indebtedness that runs the risk of discouraging efforts aimed at adaptation and structural reforms, which are absolutely essential for their development."
"And so the European Union has to contribute towards this concerted effort made by the main international donors, with the aim of reducing the debt, a particularly keen problem for our ACP partners."
"We too, as rapporteur, declare our obvious support for the Community response."
"As rapporteur, I think it essential to reinforce the EU's commitment to the process of structural adaptation implemented in the ACP countries."
"As rapporteur, I think it will be necessary to accentuate the fundamental problem of economic and social development and to take the indicators of human development into account."
"Finally, as rapporteur, we believe it important that the Council adopts the draft decision as soon as possible and that the Member States of the Union contribute rapidly with their financial participation to the institutions responsible for taking this initiative forward."
"Mr President, the debt contracted by the ACP countries towards the member countries of the European Union, as well as towards the European Union itself, represents in many ways a stereotypical case of the heterogenesis of ends, the mechanism of which the Austrian economist Von Mises showed us so well."
"Not only has the level of total debt gone on growing, not only does the weight of interest often exceed the sum of money originally paid out, and not only is it that such burdens finish up hindering the development which they profess to want to foster, but other economic disadvantages have been added to these."
"Often it is not the population which is implicated but only the government, and it is the pursuit of the ends desired by the latter, and not by the former, which has been put first."
"Often, the intention is even to foster purely and simply the interests of the ruling political class."
"This is why we find the ambiguous phenomena of mutual interest between the European political class and the political class of the ACP countries, phenomena which are always to the detriment of the people whom rather they profess to want to favour."
"This is why we also find the phenomena of very deep mistrust towards the European countries held by the people of the developing countries, which should be, by consequence, more closely associated with their European brothers."
"Finally, this is why we find a sort of renewed economic and financial dependence on the part of the developing countries upon the countries of Europe, a dependence which is frankly neo-colonialist in flavour."
"The reduction of the debt is therefore imperative, but with certain conditions."
"The first is that this should not break the basic rule expressed in the Latin maxim pacta sunt servanda ; the reduction of the debt must serve, in short, to allow the developing countries to be released from their commitments as far as is realistically possible."
"The second is that the developing countries should display genuine good intentions, through good management of the finance and structural reforms of their economies."
"Only by this will we contribute to helping the developing countries to really leave behind what will otherwise still remain a minority status."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us begin by supporting the claim with which the rapporteur opens the proposed resolution requiring Parliament to be formally consulted on this Commission communication, not only because it relates to Community policy within the scope of the LomÃ© Convention, but because a Joint Parliamentary Assembly exists between the EU and the ACP countries."
"Raising this initial question, another one would then arise from the heading of the communication, but we'll leave that until the end of the speech as it seems important to us to begin by describing the situation this communication is seeking to answer."
"There was a time when the image of the time-bomb to wipe out the debt of the so-called ""Third World' was used, and the fact is that there has been a need to make safety mechanisms operate for the explosive situation not to develop into an uncontrollable tragedy from the social point of view."
"This is more a time when the safety valves or lifebuoys will have to operate as written in the explanatory statement, and the Community response will seek to do just that, after bilateral rescheduling has exhausted its virtues as a remedy, also strengthening the dependence relations resolving real problems of indebtedness to a far greater extent."
"An analysis of the situation would seem to be more of a diagnosis as the details available and the same explanatory statement leave several signs of this imbalance the world is suffering."
"Only in this way can we describe the increasing gulf between the rich and the poor countries, and between the poor and the even poorer countries, between indebted and heavily indebted countries, countries impoverished and indebted through and through, owing to the deterioration in trade relations, the promotion and stimulation of indebtedness by creditors with a surplus or unrestrained production of surplus liquidity."
"The additional diagnoses provide real revelations."
"Although the numbers require updating, it is significant that the latest ones referred to indicate the addition of six new countries to what is sadly known as the ""heavily indebted club' and that only one of the previous countries has succeeded in getting out of this undesirable category."
"The situation has got dangerously worse in some regions, particularly in Africa, reaching technical levels that raise the pressing question of tolerability."
"On that account, the Commission's proposal only relates to those countries whose debt vis-Ã -vis the Community is considered intolerably high."
"There are eleven of them, and it is very painful for a Portuguese, and certainly for the rapporteur, that the official language of three of these countries is Portuguese."
"But the diagnosis, if static, if it continues for the situation, is always unsatisfactory, and particularly when it fails to identify the causes clearly, and on that account cannot be used to attack the roots of the evil."
"This analogy with a clinical picture will be relevant, because while the prescriptions and treatment required by the Commission are aimed at sufferers in the terminal stages, as emergency aid called ""exceptional assistance' for those on the brink of starvation so that they do not die of hunger but continue to live in hunger, there is another image in this part-session week, which is also similar to a drug addict who has got into debt and is desperate because he has no drugs or money: ""I'll sell you my product on credit, even if you do not want to buy it, and now you have no money to pay me and so I have been increasing my prices as you grow dependent on them."
"You are in need but do not kill yourself, do not kill anyone, do not steal, I ask you for part of the debt and I lend you more money so you can buy more doses at the price I have fixed for the time being, and then I'll put it up later' ."
"It should be very clear that there is no question of wiping out the debt."
"It is just a question of reducing it, and so we should congratulate the Commission, and also the MEP who is trying to improve the proposal, when Council failed to give it great priority in the explanation of reasons, although it paid some attention to it."
"And this Friday of the part-session of the European Parliament is not seen as a time for an exercise in catharsis."
"This prospect does not lead us to stop talking for so long, as we have time to do so this time."
"But it means that one fundamental question almost loses significance in this context, which is that, as the Commission makes its proposal and the rapporteur gives his opinion, the cause of the situation is not called into question in the slightest."
"However, the entire economic strategy will continue and should continue to be established on the same requirements or even reinforce them."
"The entire economic recovery, the entire economic growth of those countries (we cannot even talk of economic development) passes through the receipts of the World Bank and the IMF, which has been tested on many occasions already, with the results we are now faced with that have led to the proposal to increase the doses."
"For that reason, we have waited until the end to talk about the communication heading. This heading does not give priority to the Community response to the initiative relating to the debt held by these countries, which is made into a sub-heading."
"It gives priority to support and structural adaptation, and only afterwards to the reduction of the debt held by the highly indebted ACP States."
"In order: first the treatment, then the diagnosis and finally the patient."
"We all know that the time is not one for solidarity and cooperation."
"However, nothing is even said about this."
"But we just stay here, not making progress."
"And perhaps we should consider ourselves lucky that we have been able to talk about a subject for so long with an approach of wanting to finish with it, but which reality and the levels of intolerability make it necessary to make public and to be faced, although the Commission and Parliament have a way of escaping it, which is possibly inconvenient for Council."
"There is a Portuguese saying, ""Great remedies for great ills' ."
"The level of awareness of the seriousness of the ills has not yet achieved great remedies."
"We would point out once again and to conclude the positive aspect of having to face a situation, although within its limits of tolerability, and only in the search for remedies and continuity and reinforcement of what we consider to be its causes."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report discusses the issue of the debt burden of various countries in the southern hemisphere and as we all know, it is a heavy burden on the positive and dynamic development of these countries."
"The European Parliament, as well as the equally represented Assembly of the ACP-European Union has often declared itself in favour of initiatives."
"In this concrete case it is the European Union itself which is coming up with a very interesting proposal, namely to give the eleven ACP countries which are weighed down by heavy debts a contribution at the expense of the European Union."
"We fully endorse the European Union taking such an initiative, especially as we know that the door is shut on many things in a number of ACP countries, because they are tripped up over and over again by heavy debt payments."
"We are pleased with the fact that this report fully supports the initiative of the Commission, and we also think it is important that a number of amendments have been incorporated into the report with regard to the original Commission proposal, by emphasizing, for instance, that it is crucial that a manageable level of debt is set which includes social indicators."
"The rapporteur can rely on the commitment of the Green Group towards this dossier."
"Mr President, I wish to apologize on behalf of my group for the absence of Mr Scarbonchi, who must have unexpectedly been unable to attend."
"Mr President, the HIPC initiative on debt relief in developing countries marks a new approach on the part of the IMF and the World Bank."
"People have recognized that debt problems are a serious impediment to healthy development in the most indebted countries."
"I can only give my unreserved support to that."
"It is important that the EU takes an active part in the work to remedy the debt problems, both because debt impedes growth in developing countries, and because it sends a political signal to the Member States and other creditors that Europe is taking the problems of developing countries seriously."
"Therefore debt relief should also be followed up by other forms of help to fight poverty."
"Against this background the outcome of the Council's discussion is disappointing."
"Instead of allocating extra money for debt relief, people have only been able to agree to use funds from the existing budget."
"That means that there are only funds for the first five of the eleven ACP countries which need debt relief."
"We therefore need to find new funds when the remaining six countries are approved for debt relief."
"I agree with paragraphs 6 and 7 in Mr Torres Couto's report because they urge us not to demand strict adherence to the criteria for approval for HIPC."
"Of course there have to be structural adjustments in developing countries, possibly with the inclusion of environmental and political considerations."
"But if debt relief is made dependent on successful three-year reform programmes, it will exclude the weakest countries."
"It is precisely in these countries that a lightening of the debt burden will make structural programmes easier to implement."
"I believe that structural programmes should go hand in hand with a relief of debt and not just be a condition for it."
"Both structural reforms and debt relief are preconditions for what really matters: relieving the poverty and the poor economic outlook."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, anyone who reads the Torres Couto report must come to the conclusion, at least in parts, that the rapporteur's view of the problem is starry-eyed and too much that of the developing countries."
"For years, if not decades, the question of the indebtedness of poor countries has been a problem of our cooperation."
"On the one hand, it is a great help for many countries to have access to credit."
"On the other hand, precisely in these countries, unforeseeable developments are often the reason for them to walk smack into debt traps."
"But we must not overlook that in this field too, unfortunately, the east-west conflict has left its traces behind."
"The Commission's proposal to set up a fund for relieving the debts of poor countries is to be welcomed."
"But the assessment should not be only according to the current debt status, but also the effort for a good administration must always be taken into account."
"It should be pointed out that countries with great mineral wealth, such as the former Zaire, get the same support as Ethiopia, among others."
"Admittedly we want to give President Kabila in the Democratic Republic of the Congo a probationary period, but the question for us is whether it is being taken into account that only a clear change from a dictatorship to a democracy can be a reason for a generous remission of debt."
"It must also be emphasized that debts cannot be reduced unconditionally, because as well as the question of a somewhat democratic form of government there are the questions of corruption and excessive expenditure on armaments."
"In Mr Torres Couto's report, the amendments concerning the involvement of the European Parliament must be particularly emphasized."
"Admittedly the proposal concerns the money of the Development Fund, but unfortunately it is not subject to the budgetary control of the European Parliament."
"Yet the participation of Parliament is an absolute requirement to ensure democratic control."
"We will also get into difficulties if democratization plays an important part in the arguments with the developing countries, but on the European side Parliament is not involved."
"The draft decision aims in the right direction, if the Commission's standards are not relaxed too much."
"I hope that the basic ideas of the statement are put into effect quickly and successfully, to the benefit of the people in the affected developing countries."
"Mr President, I can agree with the good intentions of the Torres Couto report, but I would like make a few comments."
"Firstly, I wonder whether this approach, which to some extent resembles what we in the Netherlands call never say die', will genuinely get us out of this vicious circle of debt."
"We are talking about 5 % of the total debt."
"It is true, it is a great deal of money, but I find it a bit neocolonial to link debt relief to sound environmental policy."
"You cannot demand this from these countries; not yet, in any case."
"Then there is the reference to the 7 % of the gross national product which has been promised for more than twenty years."
"We all know that most of the countries, willingly or unwillingly, will never achieve this."
"I am not all happy with the idea that countries which have arrears are ineligible for relief."
"To my mind it would be better if, slowly but gradually, we worked towards writing off the debts, but then we should be allowed to make some demands."
"We will have to open our markets to their products, retain minimum expenditure by these countries on arms, and let experts who are trained in the West return to these countries."
"Only then will they have a genuine opportunity to develop."
"Mr President, developing world debt is now at two thousand billion American dollars."
"The report now being discussed concerns eleven countries with the lowest national product in the world, the indebted and poverty-stricken HIPC countries."
"These countries are in debt to the tune of 5.6 billion American dollars and the costs of this initiative to the EU come to some ECU 150 million."
"The Commission in its communication is right when it recommends the partial relief of loans."
"The poor developing countries are in a grave state."
"They have to pay off their loans in the shape of cheap produce, apart from in cash."
"The price goes down the more pressed the seller is to sell."
"The poor countries are in urgent need of help."
"This makes their position all the more difficult."
"Investments cannot be made, though the minimal amount of investment could make all the difference."
"This impasse hampers even further the development of these countries."
"Dire poverty paralyses all development."
"And the social structure cannot develop either because there are not enough resources for education and standards are steadily declining."
"The situation also jeopardizes the progress of democracy and peace."
"It can spark off unrest and weaken opportunities for democratic development when people realize that more of their money is going to lenders in the rich countries than to the sick in their own country."
"The situation for agriculture in the poor countries is also bad."
"Agriculture has to focus on exports and nonfoodstuffs while the nation suffers from undernourishment."
"For this reason I strongly support the ideas contained in the Commission's communication."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Torres Couto, and Mr Vecchi for their speeches, and thank Parliament for its interest and support for the Commission's proposal for Community involvement in the initiative on the debt of heavily indebted countries."
"This initiative means an important advance in how the international community has taken on board - until now - the debt problems of the poorest countries."
"For the first time there is a framework which allows coordinated global action to take place, on the part of all borrowers, to help heavily indebted, poor countries who are struggling to put into action economic reform programmes."
"This framework includes not only debt reduction, in the case of bilateral commercial debt, but also individually adopted measures in each case which are intended to reduce the multilateral debt load in these countries."
"The European Community is offering grants to the heavily indebted, poor countries in the form of non-repayable aid packages."
"And although the amounts are small, the Community can in no way remain on the fringe of these initiatives."
"It is clear that the political importance of Community involvement in this debt initiative is very much greater than its contribution in terms of absolute figures."
"The proposal from the Commission has been discussed in depth with the Member States who have shown their full support for the Community's involvement in this initiative."
"However, in the debates we have looked for an alternative solution to financing debt reduction on a Community scale, responding to concerns from Member States who do not wish to place additional burdens on national budgets, but guaranteeing, at the same time, that the resources given to the initiative are additional."
"I am pleased to announce that an agreement has been reached at this time."
"Consequently we hope that the Council will adopt its conclusions shortly."
"This agreement has favourable elements."
"The Council has committed itself to a full Community involvement in this initiative."
"In the case of countries who would fulfil conditions to benefit from this initiative in 1997 - or fulfil them in 1998 - financing debt reduction, on behalf of the Community, will be guaranteed by earmarking annual income stemming from the interest payments of the EDF funds."
"Such financing adheres to the principle of providing extra resources and guarantees that the Community will give aid above the present aid levels intended for those countries."
"Throughout 1998, and on the basis of the Committee's report, the Council will reconsider the later financial needs and will make a decision with reference to the future involvement of financing by the Community in this initiative, including the possibility of financial measures through amortization of previous loans from the European Development Fund."
"Mr President, our two institutions, Parliament and Commission, support Community involvement in this initiative but the parliamentary proposal to resolve this requires a more flexible approach, intending to include a wider group of countries, and to guarantee the quickest and most effective reduction of debt."
"In its contacts with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and its creditor governments, the Commission has always fought for this initiative, based on wide criteria, to be applied. This initiative should have appropriate and suitable support for the heavily indebted poor countries who are struggling to apply economic reform, hoping to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty."
"Consequently, it is encouraging to observe that this initiative has continued to evolve and that its targeting has improved."
"The initiative may not be perfect, perhaps, but it is founded on a wide, international consensus of helping a group of countries whose development efforts continue to be hampered by their heavy debt."
"Moreover, this initiative should be seen as part of an international collaboration intended to help poor, heavily indebted countries."
"As a result, the reduction of debt should be accompanied by a level of development aid which will be continuous and adequate."
"Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution.)"
"Mr President, yesterday we were debating the effectiveness of development aid in this House."
"Aid is not only ineffective because the macro-economic conditions are unfavourable in many developing countries."
"One of the reasons for this is the enormous debt burden the developing countries are suffering."
"In the excellent Torres Couto report, which I have been able to agree with wholeheartedly, the responsibility is quite rightly placed not only at the door of the developing countries."
"The lenders have a responsibility in so far as they have too easily granted credit to corrupt dictators or given loans to economically dubious projects."
"Although it was generally acknowledged that the developing countries could never pay off these debts, writing them off or rescheduling them was never a matter for discussion, in particular as far the multinational debts were concerned."
"Fortunately, thanks to the initiative of the World Bank and the IMF, this has changed; and thanks to the proposal of the Commission and the European Union, this initiative is being implemented."
"I also agree with the rapporteur that not only macro-economic indicators must be used to calculate the concept 'tolerable debt', but that social indicators must be included."
"The rich nations cannot go on giving development aid to poor nations with one hand, whilst cashing in the interest on these countries' enormous debts."
"Moreover, for many countries, writing off debt can signal the beginning of an economic recovery."
"It is good that the EU is taking the problems of developing countries seriously and is helping to reduce their debt burden."
"However, that is not enough for a stable development in poor countries."
"There are only enough funds for debt relief in five of the eleven countries."
"However, debt relief is not enough."
"The aim should be to remove the whole debt so that these countries are able to get out of the vicious circle in which they find themselves."
"Debt relief should also go hand in hand with political structural programmes for growth, employment and long-term sustainable development through mature trade relations."
"However, I still voted yes to the report."
"Mr President, as my own government is taking a leading role in aiming to cut the debt burden of the world's poorest countries as a positive way to start the next millennium, I am happy to support this report here today."
"In Britain Chancellor Gordon Brown and Clare Short, as the first Cabinet level minister for our newly created Department for International Development, have met with church leaders and others to discuss debt relief issues."
"I hope that my many colleagues in this House with influence over their respective churches will ask them to lobby their national governments as not all have so far followed the British in our enthusiasm for this important work."
"The report is correct to link the need for sustainable economic reform by poorer countries with debt relief by the more developed countries."
"Both north and south can work in partnership here so that for example environmental and poverty reduction work by indebted countries go hand in hand with debt relief."
"The many constituents who have raised this important subject with me will be glad to see that Mr Torres Couto and Parliament are adding their voices to the campaign for debt relief."
"Fisheries relations with Latvia"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A4-0397/97) by Mr Macartney, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of Protocol I to the Agreement on fisheries relations between the European Community and the Republic of Latvia laying down the conditions relating to joint enterprises provided for in the said agreement (COM(97)0323 - C4-0364/97-97/0177(CNS))"
"Mr President, in the same spirit that you are congratulating people on their birthdays, I would like to congratulate the people of Latvia for the achievements they have managed to chalk up on behalf of freedom in Europe."
"We should congratulate them, the Estonians and the Lithuanians."
"In their own ways, they have helped to keep the flame of freedom and democracy burning in an area of Europe where there have been many difficulties."
"It is important that we approach the Latvian agreement in that spirit."
"We all want to encourage the people of the Baltic Republics to think in terms of their European identity and in terms of preparing for European Union membership."
"This is particularly important when the signals coming from the Commission in recent weeks were somewhat mixed."
"The idea that one of the three would be in the first wave of accession discussions while the other two could wait behind was met with some consternation in the capitals of the neighbouring republics."
"They could not quite see the logic, nor could I."
"What is encouraging is that subsequently the idea of something more of a regatta approach prevailed in the Council of Ministers."
"It is very important in that context that we welcome all the moves proposed, including this fisheries agreement, to bring in all the countries of Eastern Europe from Estonia, through Latvia and Lithuania right down to Slovakia and Bulgaria and so on; that we do not say that there are two classes of potential Member States out there but welcome them all to be in dialogue with us."
"The background to this report is that there were agreements in 1993 with the three Baltic Republics. There were separate agreements with Finland and Sweden, which, at that stage, were not members of the European Union."
"We are delighted that Sweden and Finland voted to join the EU and are now fully integrated."
"But obviously a renegotiation had to take place in which the European Union negotiated on behalf of the original members but also on behalf of Sweden and Finland, which are neighbours of Latvia across the Baltic Sea."
"This was duly renegotiated in 1996 and as far as Lithuania was concerned, it immediately proceeded to adopt a protocol which has come into force."
"Now it is Latvia's turn."
"The Lithuanians have shown the way and the Latvians are next in line."
"Latvia has a relatively small fleet."
"186 vessels in the in-shore fleet at the last count and 15 longdistance vessels which fish mainly off Mauritania."
"We are not talking about a huge fleet and it is important to emphasize that no net addition is being proposed to the fleet of Latvia in this agreement."
"The important point is that the proposal will involve joint enterprises between the European Community and Latvia and also that there will be a grant of ECU 2.5 million to assist in the modernization process."
"It is perhaps surprising, but worth noting, that the Latvians have not fished their full quota within their own waters."
"So, there are some fish available there without doing damage to the overall conservation goals which we all hold dear."
"There are provisions in the agreement for a joint committee - which is a very positive signal to send - to talk about the transfer of EC vessels, the modernization of the Latvian fleet and so on."
"I should like to emphasize two objectives which could be given more commitment."
"One is that there should be an annual report to this Parliament."
"We have a special interest in the pre-accession phase in those countries."
"Secondly, more resources should be devoted to research."
"These are not controversial points and I hope that in his reply the Commissioner will confirm that is in line with the Commission's thinking."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Macartney on his excellent report, setting out very clearly the issues involved in this fishing agreement with Latvia."
"I should also like to concur with his remarks this morning concerning all the Baltic countries and their common progress towards EU membership."
"It is important that we achieve a balance between enabling the Baltic states applying to join the European Union to modernize their fleets - in the case of Latvia, as has been said, boats are on average 20 years old - and the need to maintain overall fish stocks and not increase overall fishing capacity."
"This scheme for the sale of Community ships, which must be at least five years old, to be reflagged as Latvian vessels, should contribute to the achievement of that balance, provided that there is careful monitoring to ensure that such boats are not subsequently reintegrated into the Community fleets and also that quotas are observed."
"This is why we need an annual report on this issue."
"If joint ventures and bilateral projects can be developed between Latvia and the EU in the course of modernizing and privatizing the ageing Latvian fleet, this can only be beneficial to the progress of Latvia towards full European Union membership."
"In this spirit, we welcome the Commission proposals and look forward to a speedy confirmation of the protocol to enable such cooperation to start at Community level, in addition to existing bilateral initiatives by individual Member States."
"Mr President, it was almost seven years ago, and like today it was a Friday, when I made my first fisheries speech here in the plenum."
"In Germany we say Friday is fish day."
"Only on Sunday is there tasty roast meat."
"What has changed today?"
"As far as the day of the week is concerned, not much."
"I am disappointed about that."
"Even when we look at the agenda of the part-sessions of the next six months until July 1998, in general nothing about the scheduling has changed."
"That is not right."
"Why not?"
"Just look at today's report."
"It points to the future of the EU after the year 2000."
"How can I convince you of that?"
"Before the Commission begins the negotiations about a new agreement, and before extending such an agreement, it must present an assessment of the essential elements."
"These are the state of the fish stocks, the effects of the agreement on the Community budget or the division of the financial participation of the European Community and the ship owners."
"For instance, this agreement with Latvia, in its protocol, goes particularly into this financial participation by setting up joint enterprises."
"With the Treaty of Amsterdam, an enlargement of the European Union is now becoming reality."
"It obviously includes, of the Baltic states, Latvia as well as Estonia and Lithuania."
"Against the background of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the previous fisheries agreements - that is the agreements of the EU with these third countries - gain a new meaning."
"The things which matter as far as the expansion is concerned are strengthening basic democratic values, creation of competitive jobs to overcome structural weaknesses in the medium term, encouragement of small and medium-sized companies and improvement of European environmental quality."
"The last leaves much to be desired in the Baltic."
"The experience which has been gained with the administration of EU money, the preoccupation with these Community procedures, and setting up joint enterprises, will - I am convinced - help Latvia on the way to faster privatization, and at least benefit its efforts to prepare its fisheries administration sufficiently for its future accession."
"The fisheries agreement with Latvia is virtually a factor in the introductory strategy for this candidate for accession, and must thus not only be seen with goodwill by the present Community, but explicitly welcomed."
"I hope that you are now convinced that we should not only approach it on a Friday."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Macartney on the preparation and presentation of his report."
"Of course, any report for which he has responsibility is prepared well and this is no exception."
"In the fisheries agreement between the EU and Latvia signed on 16 December, the contracting parties agreed to encourage the establishment of joint enterprises as laid down in the protocol conditions."
"I think it is vitally important that there should be such enterprises and I believe those contributing from within the EU can play an important role in the development of the industry in Latvia."
"This is important to that country and, as in my own country, important to the peripheral coastal regions where there is no alternative source of employment."
"The protocol will have important advantages for the Union and Latvia."
"The establishment of joint enterprises and financial participation by the Union will assist Latvia to meet some of its industry's main objectives which are: modernizing the fleet, improving the fisheries administration and boosting imports for its processing sector."
"The EU will benefit from the transfer of vessels to the Latvian flag and, more importantly, have access to its fishing zones."
"This will relieve, even if in a small way, the pressure on the fleets and the pressure on the stocks, taking into consideration in particular the fact that they are under-fishing their quotas."
"Mr President, I should also like to congratulate Mr Macartney on his report."
"This protocol is designed to transfer capacity from the European Union to Latvia by making it easier to establish joint enterprises."
"Vessels are to be re-flagged, supposedly with a provision that it does not lead to an increase in the overall capacity of the Latvian fleet."
"But the question here is how can this actually be ensured?"
"On average, the Latvian fleet is some 20 years old, whereas the EU vessels which will be transferred can be as young as five years."
"Even if the gross registered tonnage of the fleet does not increase by transferring vessels, such a substitution of younger vessels for older ones will lead, inevitably, to an increase in the effective fishing capacity of the Latvian fleet."
"One of the lessons learned from my report on the control of the CFP was that even the EU vessels registries were not accurate."
"So how can we be sure of the current capacity of the Latvian fleet and that these transfers will not lead to an increase and more overfishing?"
"Compared with the agreements with the ACP countries, this is a much more equitable agreement in that it is not an exploitation of the country involved;"
"Latvians will be employed."
"This is a very important aspect that should be transferred to agreements with ACP countries as it is much more equitable."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Macartney."
"We should always welcome the signing of a fisheries agreement from the basis that they should be beneficial and equitable for both parties."
"We regret, therefore, that Article 6 of the Protocol with Latvia will ruin what might be a good start in the phase of fisheries relations with Baltic countries, and even more seriously there is possibly a grave precedent being set for the future."
"The Article I referred to, which the Commission should never have accepted as discriminatory and clearly prejudicial to Community interests, establishes that joint enterprises are obliged to have a crew who live exclusively in Latvia."
"The present crews in these ships, Mr President, will therefore lose their jobs."
"A summit on employment has just been held, which has stressed that this is one of the most serious problems for the Union and its solution should be our prime objective. We cannot understand why the fishing authorities accept clauses to boost the number of unemployed."
"On the other hand a new regulation on the Structural Funds, strongly linked to the creation of employment, is in an advanced stage of preparation."
"Therefore it might be taken as a contradiction that any employer who showed a real interest in promoting a joint enterprise would have no access to Community funds since, as in Latvia's case, not only would jobs not be created but they would be destroyed with joint enterprises."
"The fishing authorities have not only assessed these consequences but in addition intensify them with agreements of this type."
"Mr President this is regrettable and dangerous, all the more so when we are talking about a country - Latvia - which is a net exporter of fishery products to the Union with whose production we are in direct competition."
"Therefore, Mr President, I think that in future we should not adopt these kinds of clauses and urge the Commission in future not to include them in fishery agreements."
"Mr President, in the first place I would like to congratulate Mr Macartney for his report and I am pleased to warmly welcome the conclusion of this Protocol."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you well know, after the expansion of the Community in 1995, the Commission negotiated new fishing agreements with a series of third countries."
"The Council's negotiating guidelines were looking at the establishment of joint undertakings and joint enterprises in the fishing sector as a fresh element in the new fishing agreements."
"The proposal here consists of a Protocol on the establishment of joint enterprises with Latvia as it applies to the fishing agreement which was ratified last year."
"Once approved the present Protocol should bring up to date all the fishing agreements with the Baltic States in accordance with the Council's negotiating guidelines."
"In this way we will contribute to the alignment to which Mr Macartney was referring in his speech this morning, in the negotiations for accession to the European Community for all those countries who have applied. I can tell you as well that we look favourably on the proposal to investigate this."
"In regard to the speech from Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez I would like to say to her that, in accordance with the plan for permanent joint enterprises, ships will be removed from the Community register and be made to fly the flag of a third country."
"Consequently they are subject to the legislation of such a country."
"Latvia explicitly declared that the captain and crew of the Latvian ships should be Latvian citizens or permanently resident in Latvia, in accordance with the legislation of that country."
"Similar arrangements are included in the Protocol negotiated with Lithuania."
"Since this Protocol was accepted by the Member States, and ratified without too many difficulties, the Commission has carried out negotiations with Latvia in accordance with the same approach that was followed with Lithuania."
"But I would like to reassure Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez by telling her that the Commission has the firm resolve, when it negotiates similar Protocols in the future, to do as much as it can to safeguard Community employment as far as is possible."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mountain regions and Structural Funds"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:"
"B4-1016/97 by Mr Ebner, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, to the Commission, on taking into account the specific nature of mountain regions in the reform of the Structural Funds; -B4-0008/98 by Mr Azzolini, Mr Podesta and Mr Santini, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, to the Commission, on mountain regions; -B4-0009/98 by Mr Ephremidis, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, to the Commission, on mountain regions in the European Union; -B-0006/98 by Mr Bontempi and Mr Cot, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to the Commission, on mountain regions and the Structural Funds; -B4-0007/98 by Mr Macartney and Mrs Ewing, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, to the Commission, on the reform of the Structural Funds and the problems of mountain regions; -B4-0010/98 by Mrs Lindholm and Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, to the Commission, on mountain regions and the reform of the Structural Funds."
"Mr President, normally when we talk about mountain regions and mountain areas we think about agriculture."
"However this is just a part of the problem relating to mountains: there are other problems such as the question of environment, the question of employment and many others besides."
"It also needs to be said that the mountains are not just the Alps, as is often stated and as was said yesterday; there are mountain areas in almost all of the countries of the European Union."
"The debate about of the reform of the EU Structural Funds for the period after 1999 is already in full progress."
"In view of the direct relation to areas and the area effect of regional and structural policy, and of the increasing importance of the regions, which is always emphasized in the context of subsidiarity, it is considered right and necessary to supplement these efforts by formulating and introducing region-specific matters."
"A whole series of international and cross-border agreements, arrangements, models - for instance, the Alpine Convention, to which the European Union is a signatory - refers to the special features of the Alpine area, and encourages, in particular, integral actions to safeguard and develop it as an area for living, commerce, recreation and above all nature."
"Achievement of these goals also requires that the EU should become active, and the precondition for an integrated, sustained development strategy, which encourages the exploitation of the internal dynamic in the mountain area."
"The European Parliament adopted the last report about mountain regions in 1988, that is ten years ago."
"The system until now of restricting Structural Funds support to the defined areas has not made it possible to make regulations about a specific target area for mountain regions."
"In Agenda 2000, the Commission defined its plans for this reform for the future period 2000 to 2006."
"Positive features are that the financial framework has been extended, and that more money - ECU 75 billion - is available for this period than for the period 1993 to 1999."
"However, regarding the allocation of resources by the new target definition, it should be observed that the globalization of the agricultural and food markets particularly endangers the small-scale mountain farming businesses, which exercise an absolutely primary ecological function, unless special measures and long-term action programmes for the mountain economy are provided."
"According to the speech yesterday by Commissioner van den Broek about Alpine transit, the Transport Council has dealt with defining an Alpine clause."
"They want to conclude an Alpine treaty, and to provide a declaration of the Alps as a 'sensitive zone' ."
"According to the Commissioner, the Commission welcomed this conclusion of the Council of Ministers."
"The Commission would thus also be put into a position to watch over Alpine protection."
"A change of direction is visible here."
"But this thought must be thought out to the end."
"In this connection, I ask you, Mr Commissioner, to inform us in what way the Commission intends to take special account of the mountain areas in the next revision of the Structural and Regional Funds in March this year, to safeguard this area for living, commerce, recreation and nature."
"Mr President, the discussion under way on the reform of the Structural Funds has two substantial objectives."
"The first is to improve the operation of the Funds themselves and to prepare the Union for the great challenges which await it and which we all now know by heart: expansion, the reform of the CAP, policies on the environment, policies on employment, the training and movement of young people, and the fight against this century's ills, such as cancer, AIDS, drugs, including the new sickness, that of trying to legalize drugs."
"However, apart from these problems, for which there is room in other debates, it is right, here, to highlight the way in which the reform of the Structural Funds speaks directly a language like that of the mountains."
"In fact, the second objective is that of recognising in the distribution of the Funds those so-called areas of hardship or disadvantage. And certainly the mountains feature among them, especially those mountain areas in which decay, desertion, and the exodus of the young now constitute an endemic and apparently, at least up to now, unstoppable ill."
"The European Parliament's last report on mountain regions dates back to 1988."
"Ten years is a long time for a fragile and delicate policy area such as that of the mountains."
"In the light of the recent approval by the Commission of the Alpine Convention, together with the important reforms contained in Agenda 2000, it really is necessary to get some new ideas into gear, and this task falls to the Commission."
"Can the Commission therefore tell us what measures it intends to take to put the Alpine Convention into effect, to recognise the specific nature of the mountain regions, and above all, to create a serious network of specific measures which would at least create the correct approach to the problems of mountain areas?"
"I say all this in the light of the reform of the Structural Funds which those of us who live in the mountains are watching with great concern; from seven funds we are reduced to only three, and furthermore both of the funds dedicated chiefly to agriculture, 5a and 5b, have disappeared, the second being specifically for agriculture in areas of hardship and mountain areas."
"Among the three objectives and Objective 2, which has to be responsible at once for reform and restructuring in the industrial, urban and agricultural domain, of 13 initiatives only 3 remain."
"The Leader programme remains, though much criticized, and above all, concerning the annual budget, of ECU 30 billion, 2 billion is to be recovered which constituted the ex-fund 5b."
"I therefore ask the Commission, Commissioner Oreja, that you would convey this message to your colleague Mrs Fischl, in order that at least this 5 billion remains allocated to mountain agriculture."
"Mr President, we spend a lot of time talking about the Alps and other mountain regions, and there is a risk that we could fall into the self-deception of thinking that there are no problems in the plains, that everything there is getting on fine."
"Not so! But it is indeed true that in mountain regions the problems are more numerous, more acute, and need to be dealt with directly and in an integrated way."
"We all know that they share certain common characteristics: despite their variety and individuality, mountain regions have natural disadvantages caused by their climates and the composition of their soil."
"On the other hand, they have some positive features, they are environmental storehouses, repositories of historical and cultural traditions, and all of that must be conserved."
"The efforts to do this so far have been fragmented and inadequate."
"Mountain regions have deficient infrastructures, if any at all, both technical and other, in the sense of social welfare, the social state, education and health care, and this leads to the stripping of those areas, their abandonment and desertion, which will have catastrophic consequences for the environment, not only there but more widely and generally too. The result will be to destroy those roots of historical and cultural traditions."
"Our question to the Commission is whether, with the changes now being made to the Structural Funds, these exceptionally urgent and great needs of the mountain regions will be taken into account, and much more so, to counteract the adverse prescriptions and restrictions introduced by Agenda 2000, all the more now since enlargement towards the East will increase the proportion of mountain regions."
"Mr President, I speak with the experience of my own country, where there are few plains and many mountain or hilly areas."
"Will the Commissioner therefore confirm whether the changes to the Structural Funds will allow for integrated aid in support of those regions."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, my colleague Mr Bontempi (who has asked me to apologize for his absence as he has been held up in Spain today, for reasons indirectly connected with mountain regions) and I have, like other Members, noted the absence of any general debate in this house on mountain region policy, during the last ten years."
"Certainly, other institutions have taken an interest in it, particularly the Committee of the Regions, in 1995, but we have seen important changes in the landscape of mountain regions, and in the more general framework which surrounds this question: changes in the common agricultural policy and the new developments foreseeable in Agenda 2000, the Alpine Convention and its 'transit' protocol, connected with yesterday's debate on Alpine transit, and finally the substantial reform of the Structural Funds, the main subject of today's debate, the main subject because the problems of mountain regions are problems of a transcendental, transversal nature and are affected by all EC policies."
"First of all, they are affected by the common agricultural policy, because without agriculture in mountain regions, we cannot protect our heritage."
"It needs to be maintained."
"Our mountain regions must not be invaded by wasteland, or damaged by avalanches and landslides."
"Farmers in mountain areas must therefore be sure of an adequate income."
"A recent report by the French Planning Department, under the initiative of Mr Bazin, on the effects of the reform of the common agricultural policy on agricultural incomes, asks several questions in this respect."
"It notes the on the whole favourable effect of the reform of the agricultural policy, in all agricultural areas, but those who have gained the most, in this respect, are farmers in underprivileged areas but not in the mountains."
"Farmers in the plain are in second place."
"On the other hand, the research highlights a serious falling behind of farmers in mountain areas, whose average income is increasingly falling below the national average, that is, the handicap of being in the mountains is not being compensated to a sufficient degree."
"A slight change in the mechanism of allocation of aid would doubtless put an end to this trend, and would also have a favourable effect on agricultural employment."
"I shall do myself the honour of forwarding this information to the Commission."
"The second question I should like to raise relates to the policy of encouraging quality."
"It is obvious that in mountain regions we need to have a policy of quality production, because it is impossible to compete with the milk factories in the plain."
"This also applies to cheese, as well as honey, ham, and arts and crafts."
"This policy was encouraged, in France, by the Mountain Regions Act of 1985, which instituted a 'Mountain' label."
"The label was declared contrary to the Treaty by the European Court of Justice, in the Pistre ruling of 7 May 1997, which, rightly in fact, detected discrimination against non-French products."
"We must therefore find another means of encouraging the quality of production, at the European level, and why not by means of a 'European mountain' label?"
"That is the name that professional people in my country have suggested."
"I would like the Commission to consider that proposal."
"Finally, the aim of the Structural Funds should be to compensate for natural handicaps."
"A specific 'mountain region' objective has now been excluded; it would be contrary to the concentration of the Structural Funds."
"But it is at least necessary to confirm the specific identity of the 'mountain regions' , in respect of Objective 2, and to create a firmer link with physical handicap, instead of the simple criterion of income, because some economic activities can have a harmful effect on environmental protection, or agriculture in mountain areas."
"That is the case with road transport, or some forms of mass tourism."
"The conditions of allocation of aid must be relaxed, in compliance with the provisions of the Treaty, particularly those relating to competition."
"Finally, to conclude, Madam President, Mr Commissioner, a word about cross-border programmes, which relate to several mountainous areas, certainly not all the mountain regions of Europe, but several mountainous areas, particularly the Alps and the Pyrenees."
"The Commission has decided to develop these programmes and to give them larger grants."
"I am very pleased about this and I hope that these programmes will take fully into consideration the specific nature of the mountain environment as it is, because our mountainous areas are part of a heritage which is common to the whole of Europe."
"It is a fragile heritage. It must be protected, that is, the men and women who maintain it must be encouraged, within the framework of a proper sustained rural development policy."
"That is what we want and what we hope the reform of the Structural Funds will achieve."
"Madam President, I should like to say, first of all, how much I welcome the initiatives taken by colleagues in joining us in raising this issue, which is clearly of very great importance."
"Also, the timing is very significant given that we are facing a review of the whole idea of structural and regional funding."
"One of the problems that we face is of definition."
"Let me just read from the question which I have tabled, along with Mrs Ewing: ' What exactly is a mountain?' ."
"The key criterion, I would argue, is the tree line."
"The trees indicate how high things can grow in the mountains."
"I would urge the Commission to bear this in mind when looking at this proposal."
"The second definition problem concerns the data which affects the mountainous areas."
"It is very easy, indeed, with the sparseness of population of mountainous areas for the disadvantage which the inhabitants of those areas suffer to be lost in a much bigger area of definition."
"I know that the Commission is very much wrestling with the problem of defining areas."
"I would counsel against losing the disadvantage of those areas in a much bigger area just for the sake of administrative convenience."
"That is a battle which will have to be fought, and fought very hard, right across Europe."
"I would hope that the Commission would be able to look pragmatically at the whole question and begin to take into account the question of climate, not just some of the macro-economic indicators."
"Some people might think that is a tall order, but there is an encouraging precedent, and that is what has happened in the accession negotiations with Sweden and Finland when the Swedes and the Finns quite rightly argued that Objective 6, as we now call it, should be recognized, i.e. that the climatic disadvantages of the north of those countries should be the subject of a special objective."
"That is due to be transferred into Objective 1."
"That is fine as far as it goes."
"But as far as it goes is not enough."
"We have to argue for the same principle to be applied right across Europe so that those who are challenged by a very cold climate at certain times of the year or permanently, for that matter, would qualify for the same sort of treatment."
"This would have application certainly to the highlands of Scotland."
"People go there to train to attack the Himalayas and therefore, by definition, the mountains are seen as fairly cold and challenging."
"It also applies to other parts that colleagues have mentioned from France, Italy and South Tyrol."
"All this mean that we have to move towards a new approach to the question of redressing the disadvantages which clearly is at the heart of the whole idea of regional and structural policy."
"I commend these initiatives to the House."
"I hope that the Commission will take them on board and respond positively."
"Madam President, it is very positive that Parliament is drawing attention to the special situation and the problems which the EU's mountain regions have."
"We have several, including the regions in Southern Europe which have been mentioned here, in Greece, Spain and Italy."
"We also have mountain regions in Central Europe and mountain regions in Northern Europe."
"Apart from that, we will probably also have mountain regions in the new Member States."
"Just as Mr Macartney said, it is worth noting that the problems are not the same."
"I believe it is very important to define what we mean by mountain regions."
"Not least the question of climate is important."
"As a Swede I am of course particularly passionate about the problems which the Scandinavian areas have, and which are today covered by Objective 6."
"To be brief: what do we mean by mountain regions?"
"I think it is with this definition that we must begin."
"The mountain regions are Europe's greatest ecological heritage, but they are a sensitive one whose unique biological character can easily be destroyed for a long time to come, perhaps forever."
"They are also in many places Europe's largest reservoirs of drinking water, something which we all know we must be concerned about."
"The major threat in a number of areas is mass tourism which wears down and overloads the ecology and the biology."
"It is the development of both large and small transport links, roads, motorways, tunnels, which we have talked about here, and not least the trans-European networks as a whole."
"Environmental damage in both air and water is increasing."
"The problems of sparsely populated areas are making people move; small farming and forestry businesses are being broken up and the particular culture and cultural heritage which is found in many places is being destroyed."
"I am thinking not least of the only minority people in the EU, the Sami in northern Scandinavia."
"There people have developed an interplay between nature and mankind."
"In spite of everything we Greens are not in favour of the creation of special programmes or objective areas for mountain regions."
"We are running a clear risk of having an inflation of different objective areas, such as islands, wetlands, mountain regions, cities etc. We do not believe in that model."
"Future regional policy must take account of certain regions in a different way than is done today, but as a whole and not just bit by bit."
"That also applies in this case to mountain regions."
"We want people to see whether these areas can be supported when people develop an ecological and environmentally-adapted lifestyle and production."
"Perhaps people could consider whether it would be possible to put eco-labels on certain areas where people work and live in a certain way, and also provide increased aid via the Structural Funds."
"Perhaps it would be possible to develop and expand Natura 2000."
"There are a lot of things people could consider, but we would like to know what the Commission wants."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this matter allows the Commission to clearly state its stance on the reform of the Structural Funds and, more exactly, on the way in which it will take into account the specific characteristics of mountain regions."
"As we think about adapting the structural and agricultural policy, set down in Agenda 2000, questions put to the Commission deal, fundamentally, with the possibility of producing specific measures for mountain regions."
"For example by creating an objective called ""mountain' which would join together the remaining structural objectives."
"In this regard the Commission points out that adapting to local needs should bear in mind the requirements to keep the structural policy fairly straightforward as well as to assure an enhanced concentration of Structural Funds."
"The system proposed in Agenda 2000 allows, in our view, the reconciliation of the necessary simplification with a wider consideration for the specific problems of the mountain regions, and it does so for two reasons."
"Firstly, because the reorganization of the rural development policy should contain important decentralization of support policies - a question to which Mr Macartney referred earlier in his speech - and greater integration of the different instruments which are already there, which will allow, through the application of integrated regional programmes, a more suitable adaptation to the specific needs of the different regions in the European Union."
"The mountain regions should reap special benefits in relation to their definite needs and be reasonable about them."
"Secondly, because attention given to agro-environmental measures in the Agenda 2000 proposals will also allow optimum use to be made of the specific features in the mountain regions."
"The growth of conservation and value of the environment which responds to the awareness that society has about threats which endanger these and which finds a single area of application in the mountain regions, can be carried out in two directions; on the one hand by strengthening the mechanism for compensatory allowances which might become a basic support tool for extensive agrarian practices which respect the environment; and on the other hand - here I am trying to answer the concern shown a moment ago by Mr Cot - through the growth in environmental measures dedicated to a few specific objectives. I am thinking, for example, of the maintenance of Alpine pasturing, among things, which can receive greater financial support and as appropriate higher percentages of cofinancing."
"In regard to the latter I should point out that other ecologically sensitive areas, for example wet regions, can also receive greater support."
"On the fringe of this general proposal the Committee has put forward two more specific questions relating to the mountain regions; the first refers to the Alpine Convention and the measures which the Commission intends to put into operation to apply this; secondly, in relation to the classification criteria for the mountain regions and, in concrete terms, altitude."
"In regard to the Alpine Pact I wish to point out that although the European Community has ratified and signed some of its protocols amongst which mountain agriculture can be found - before beginning the ratification process for the same we must hope to effect a linguistic harmonization of the protocols."
"And given the situation the Commission's action consists for the moment in the active involvement in the work of the Standing Committee on the Alpine Convention, and in the system to coordinate what we can see and find out about the Alps."
"Finally, as far as the classification criteria for mountain regions is concerned, the Committee prefers to hope that the basic principles for reform of the Structural Funds can be decided before taking on problems of this more specific nature."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the questions and explanations of the various parties have already shown in how many ways the mountains can be seen."
"That extends from Scandinavia to Greece, and I assume that the first questioner referred mainly to the Alps."
"Since I am also a resident of the Alps, I will concentrate rather more on this area."
"However, at the same time I would like to point out - and here I agree entirely with the previous speaker, Mrs Lindholm - that we should be wary of going into detail again, at a time when we are concentrating the structural policies of the Union on the basis of Agenda 2000, even with the agreement of this Chamber."
"I believe that we should stick to the fact that the decisive motive force for the structural policies and support in this field is finally the prosperity of these regions, and thank God the Alpine lands are not necessarily the poorest in this Union."
"Therefore, in connection with such discussions, the question should finally be raised: Who should pay for it?"
"Where should the money come from, should we deduct it from somewhere, or should we provide extra money, and who is going to provide it?"
"But what we need, and thank God it has been mentioned repeatedly this week, is a clear Alpine policy of this Union."
"In connection with Alpine transit, we hear and get the feeling again and again that for some European politicians the Alps are just something like an artificial obstacle."
"There I would like to quote a colleague of the Greens who spoke yesterday, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, who said, directed to the Netherlands among others, I quote: ' If the Alpine biosphere is destroyed, you will not need to build any more dams against sea floods, but against the Rhine, because once the Alps are destroyed, you can report high water and land under water in your country all year' ."
"I believe that in this example we can see how much things are interwoven with each other, and how much the principle of the free market within the Union occasionally collides with what are in the end the bases of the life of this entire continent."
"I believe that we should take the debate which Mr Ebner has opened today as the occasion to have a more intensive discussion of such principles, in the context of the future policies of the Union, and not to maintain this opposition between economics and ecology, but to understand that one is impossible without the other!"
"I believe that the general public hardly knows that we in the European Parliament have so much work that we cannot even celebrate our national day."
"Our members who have birthdays are also very active."
"The next speaker is one of our three birthday children today."
"Mr Bernard-Reymond now has the floor for the European People's Party."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, the European project is a project for civilisation."
"This means that although Europe has accepted the challenge of globalization, it refuses to see that, under the effects of hard and fast liberalism, the mechanism of market forces alone will lead to an unvarying world, built according to the laws of competition alone."
"Liberalism, which decompartmentalizes our economies, by stimulating innovation, by leading new countries to achieve growth, is a powerful force with regard to progress."
"But we also know what imbalances it can lead to in social and also in geographical terms."
"That is why each country tries to make those corrections, which are most suited to its culture."
"And it is from that point of view that we must indeed reposition European social policy, and also regional policy, one of the areas of which relates to mountain regions."
"Mountain regions are special, rather vulnerable places, and nothing better will ever be found to protect them than to encourage healthy agriculture."
"They are places in which the notion of balance between various imperatives is essential."
"There is the question of improved access - and I do not hesitate to say that even today, although I may sound very old-fashioned."
"Improved access by road and even by motorways, which we should not fail to build where they are still needed."
"Secondly, of course, improved access by rail, and by means of telecommunications."
"By means of high quality agricultural development, tourist facilities, environmental protection, all ideas which must be included in the plans relating to cross-border mountain regions, at the European level."
"In order to do so, it is essential to recognize the specific nature of mountain regions, as a concept, legally and financially."
"It is not a question of covering the European area with a patchwork of statutes."
"It is not a question of enclosing mountain regions behind shields or privileges."
"It is simply a question of helping mountain regions to innovate, to invest in lasting development, and of enabling them to play a full part in the construction of a balanced European society, which will therefore be of a high quality."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I listened very carefully to your answer to those who tabled the joint question on mountain regions."
"Permit me to tell you, however, that your answer was very general."
"You did not address the very specific questions which Members had put to you, for example Mr Santini, but other Members from other political groups as well."
"As a supplement to what we have already heard from the other speakers, which I accept and subscribe to, I in my turn would like to ask you whether the European Commission has considered how it is going to deal with two additional problems which will probably arise in the future."
"I refer specifically, first to the problems that are likely to emerge once the postal services have been deregulated, especially in mountain regions. And secondly, to the problems which are likely to occur after the deregulation of Europe's railways."
"You know that on both these issues the European Parliament has tabled very specific proposals and has adopted them within the reports that have appeared, and you know that the European Union has not accepted them all, at least so far as the postal services are concerned."
"I would like you to tell me whether you have reconsidered the matter and how you propose to deal with it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the oral questions raised by my colleagues relating to mountain regions and, in particular, to Alpine areas, raise for us a series of problems which are burningly topical."
"There are substantially two reasons for such notable interest."
"The first is that we are talking about mountain regions, regions, that is, of which the special geomorphological nature, with all its positive consequences in terms of environment and economy - two terms which, as has already been stressed, are not antithetical but complementary - has only recently begun to be acknowledged."
"Mountain regions are not something self-contained at all; on the contrary they are of fundamental importance for the regions which surround them."
"And this leads us on to the second reason for their importance which is quite close to home for a few of us, and that is the specific nature of the Alpine area, an area which represents, if I may say so, a sort of specific nature of specific nature."
"Unlike other mountain regions, the Alps have never been a barrier; on the contrary, they have always stood as a true crossroads, that is, a place of exchange, rich in peoples, economies and cultures, and they are also - I am pleased to be able to stress this - the mother of specific cultures, which are too often forgotten, like the culture of the Walsers and the culture of the sacri monti ."
"This is why a particular status should be accorded the Alpine area within the concept of mountain regions, even through the Structural Funds, a particular status which could not fail to take account not only of the economy but also of the culture, not only of its belonging to individual States but of its specific transnational nature which is a real paradigm of what we are in the habit of calling a Europe of the regions, a Europe of the peoples."
"I would find it rather interesting to know what the opinion of the Commission is on this point."
"Madam President, the mountain regions in the European Union - as has already been pointed out in the debate - have similar features, and the mountain regions in nearby countries involved in the enlargement also have similar features."
"In many cases they are regions tied closely to rural life, also on occasion with some development of the tourist sector; they are sparsely populated and are difficult to develop and this makes it difficult to keep people on the land with an adequate infrastructure and services by providing grants."
"At the same time they are enormously attractive areas due to their natural beauty and because of the possibilities of their heritage environment."
"There have been Community initiatives dealing with other European regions with common features, the outlying or maritime regions etcetera, but the mountain regions in the past have scarcely had any specific initiative; if any it was very specifically related to an aspect of agricultural policy."
"As we approach the debate for the next reform of the Structural Funds, this question, which we are debating today, is opportune and we have already heard how the Commission has done some thinking in this regard; it would be useful indeed for the Commission to put forward a communication on possible innovations, where the Structural Funds in these mountain regions in recent years have been used, in the different countries in the Union."
"This will allow verification of whether there has been any added value when the Structural Funds have been used in these areas."
"In reforming the Structural Funds we have to look at the specific problems of these regions, what to do to maintain, protect and empower their own surroundings, making use of endogenous development and bearing very much in mind the very fragility of these natural surroundings when they are attacked by the use or misuse of foreign elements which can spoil the land and its natural features."
"The same concern should be present, not only on the Structural Funds, but also in the thinking and reform proposals for the common agricultural policy."
"The areas with important mountain regions - I live in one of them, where areas very close to the sea and predominantly mountainous areas live side by side - are an important part of the reality of this European Union."
"For this reason, it will be necessary that the regulations which will govern the Structural Funds in the future, in the way expressed by the Commissioner or in an even more detailed way, will deal with implementing them positively and integrally in this common heritage, within the framework of a rigorous regional policy, with the aim of making progress in the cohesion of our regions and our peoples."
"Madam President, the truth is that we are at a defining time in the new Community policies for regional development, within the framework of Agenda 2000, and this is the right moment to discuss this topic and formulate proposals so that the specific problems relating to mountain regions will be included in Community policies for regional development."
"Regions with a depopulation problem are, in some cases, lacking economic alternatives and needing development which moreover should be balanced with their natural environment, so that they can continue to maintain this balance in the future."
"Indeed up to the present time an objective for these zones has not existed."
"The Commissioner was discussing the need to keep Community regional policies fairly straightforward but, within this simplicity it would be of more interest to empower these areas as the Commission - I am sure - will try to do in its new proposals."
"These should include special integral measures for the development of these areas as vital, through their economic development, the development of leisure pursuits and natural development."
"Besides, many of these are cross frontier areas because, if mountain chains have divided such states, on both sides of them there have been areas of coexistence, natural surroundings and population; in this sense the empowering of cross frontier experience in the mountain regions would be of greater interest."
"At present there are many pilot schemes which the European Commission might use to empower these areas in their proposals and use them as a model."
"I am referring to cases of collaboration in the Pyrenees."
"I am sure that the Commissioner who, besides being Basque, knows his country very well, acknowledges them."
"Indeed there are models in the Aleves mountain, in the Pyrenean and Navarran valleys or in the French Basque country etcetera that may be taken as a model of what may generate economic activity respectful of the environment."
"In this sense I would like to congratulate the Commissioner especially for the report he has made in his last speech about empowerment also for mountain pasturing in so far as, besides generating economic activity, it helps to preserve the natural environment and certain cultural areas."
"Madam President, this debate concerns regional policy and an equal Europe."
"These are questions which belong to the area of solidarity."
"Everybody should be able to live a good life in our Europe."
"These are also areas, as many speakers have said, which have very special conditions."
"In my case this concerns Sweden, Finland and Northern Europe, 2 0-2 500 km north of here."
"It is largely a question of ecologically sensitive areas, very large natural resources and an immense biodiversity."
"That is why all discussions about aid should be based on the individual local and regional conditions, because it is very easy for large scale forms of aid and exploitation which do not suit the areas to do more harm than good."
"This also applies of course to all other mountain regions."
"I shall continue by describing a little of how things look in my home district."
"What we are particularly concerned about is, of course, Objective 6 Aid which is now disappearing with the changes being made in the Structural Funds."
"What is going to happen with Objective 6 Aid for Sweden and Finland, now that the Objective Areas as such are being abolished and are being included under Objective 1?"
"We got these opportunities for support through the Objective 6 Area in connection with the negotiations prior to EU membership, above all because the climate is very severe. At the moment it is 30-40 degrees below freezing in northern Sweden."
"The population density may generally be 1-3 people/km2 . People live by doing lots of different things, farming, forestry on a very small scale which provides a little money."
"People live close to nature and from nature, and people are dependent on the survival of nature's resources for their own survival. There is major depopulation and stagnation in many of the areas."
"Unfortunately the EU's agricultural policy has concentrated a bit much on large farms, both in Europe and southern Sweden, while small farmers in northern Sweden have huge problems."
"I have a question which I am very anxious to have an answer to from the Commission, if the Commissioner is now listening."
"My question is: What proposals does the Commission have for Objective Area 6 when new criteria are to be determined after the old period expires in 1999 and the new period begins?"
"I am very anxious to have an answer to that."
"Madam President, I must say that I am very happy that we are having a joint debate about the special features of the mountain regions."
"In the end the mountain region is the most sensitive rural area, and therefore continues to need our support, if it is to be maintained in its entirety and multifunctionality."
"Therefore, the high position of the rural areas must be clearly established in Agenda 2000."
"Specifically, we need to extend the differential compensation allowance for disadvantaged areas, intensify the brand and tradition protection of typical products of these regions, and support forestry more strongly."
"Another item which deserves support is without doubt better use of renewable energy."
"On this point, we must not forget that whenever agriculturally productive land becomes disused, in whatever way, it means a declaration of bankruptcy for our system."
"Agriculture cannot be laid down like an industrial business, for instance, and must be considered over a much longer period."
"These areas should therefore be particularly included in the consideration of renewable energy."
"As well as increased payment for agricultural and ecological efforts, of course there must be compensation for permanent natural disadvantages, to safeguard the cultivation of the mountain areas."
"This is not least what tourism means."
"Austria is the country of the European Union which has the highest proportion of farmers for whom farming is a secondary occupation."
"The vast majority of farmers are active in the tourism business, and in both occupations they ensure that the attractiveness and economic productivity of the mountain regions are maintained, and that continuous migration from the rural areas, and thus depopulation of the mountain regions, is stopped."
"This also shows the profound social significance and multi-functionality of agriculture."
"In Austria, just 70 %, or 2 323 000 hectares, of the agriculturally productive land comes into the European Union's category of disadvantaged areas."
"The EU average is 56 %."
"In concrete terms, this means that for instance in Austria 150 000 businesses are in a disadvantaged area."
"With regard to the enlargement of our Community to the east, the best thing would be to continue the agricultural guideline."
"Only this will ensure that it is not only a burden on domestic farmers, but that everyone has to bear their share of this great work of European unification."
"Madam President, above all I would first like to thank Mr Ebner for introducing this question, and second, I would like to make a comment."
"It shows that the Friday sittings have a purpose, because on Fridays we talk about more serious things, instead of practising demagogy, and besides there is much more consensus between the parties than at other times!"
"I would like to add to what Mr Macartney said."
"He mentioned a very important point, that not only bureaucratic criteria should be applied to defining the regions, that it is not just made to depend on height or depth, but that the climate and social conditions also play a part."
"Secondly, I would like to emphasize here that - as we have heard from all sides - it is not just the economy which is crucial."
"There is only a social function of the economy, which is the only one which actually means the future."
"Particularly for us in the mountain areas - there are very many mountain areas in my home country, although people generally do not know that, but Upper Bavaria consists partly of mountain areas - this means first that the small farmers must be maintained at any price, because without these people there are no more mountains."
"Then everything is ruined, as can be seen in all too many places in America, for instance."
"Second, in the whole definition of transport we must put always the ecological aspects in the foreground, because when we see the destructive effect which certain roads have already had, through Trentino-Alto Adige for instance, when we know how dangerous certain projects are for us, we have to say that the ecological standpoint must be allowed a quite high status, because only in this way can we maintain the heart of Europe!"
"Madam President, Austria is famous for the beautiful Alps and also for the newly created national parks."
"Yet an enormous structural change is taking place in these areas."
"On the one hand, we endeavour to look after the traditions, the beauty of the land, its naturalness and unspoiledness, and on the other hand we think intensely about the future, safeguarding the future, and the opportunities which the future will bring."
"I believe that we must do more research in this area."
"We must see with what products and services we can look into the future, we must do market research to see what visitors can come into this region, what aspects of the region are treasured, what services can be offered in this region and what products can be sent out of this region."
"The second, and perhaps even more important point is education and further education in these areas."
"We should think about what education and further education structure we can offer in these areas."
"Madam President, two words no more."
"Firstly, to say to you ladies and gentlemen that I have noted the speeches made here this morning."
"In some of them I found something similar to the speech I made halfway through the sitting, but anyway I will forward them to the Commissioners, most particularly to Mr Fischler who is the Commissioner responsible for all of them."
"Mr Kaklamanis has referred to the different topics which are being taken up in this matter, since here we are dealing with the Structural Funds and agriculture, and he has referred to the liberalization of the Post Offices and rail networks."
"These are two matters with which we are now concerned and are subjects also of questions in Parliament, and the Commission, being aware of such problems, will provide at the right time corresponding and fitting replies to the same."
"On the subject of the Alpine regions I wish to pose two questions: on the one hand everything that refers to increasing compensatory allowances in the disadvantaged areas; and on the other greater support for Alpine pasturing within the agro-environmental measures."
"I wish to assure Mr Lindqvist that although I am only wearing one of the headphones I can hear him, and besides with my surname I have no option but to listen."
"So you can understand that I follow very attentively all the speeches and especially yours, Mr Lindqvist, when you refer to all the problems posed in the Nordic regions and have clearly shown the contrast between the Alpine regions and the Nordic region."
"There is a very specific subject here which has been put forward to which I cannot give you a reply, but indeed I have listened to you - which is what we are referring to in the classification criteria for the mountain regions which have still not been defined."
"But we are going to move onto that."
"As you know, Mr Lindqvist, we are at this time examining reform of the Structural Funds."
"Mr Imaz has referred, for example, to the idea of simplification - he has mentioned, to which I am especially sensitive, some mountains in the area, in the common region, the common country which we have in the Basque area - and he knows that I have travelled over all those mountains, have climbed to the top of them throughout my life and really I am very sensitive to the arguments he was using."
"And so, I would like to say to him that if really the Commission's purpose is to look for greater simplification of the Structural Funds, this does not mean that it is impossible to reconcile simplification with a wider consideration of the specific problems relating to mountain regions."
"Dr von Habsburg has made a specific mention of this and I wish to join him in that too."
"We are going to have to bear in mind, particularly those subjects which I am going to hand over to Mr Fischler and the other appropriate Commissioners in so far as it concerns them."
"I think that it is very useful - indeed Dr von Habsburg said it a moment ago - that we can deal with important matters on a Friday."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the Parliament, thank you very much."
"Madam President, I have a rather disturbing point to raise because, on this day when we are talking about the problem of the marginal areas of Europe, I have just heard that Scotland is to lose one seat on the Committee of the Regions, and the same is going to happen to Wales."
"I find this very disturbing and want to register a protest in this House."
"I should also like to ask Commissioner Oreja, who I know has a very strong interest in these matters, whether he does not agree that this will weaken the voice of Scotland and Wales in particular at this time when we are talking about the future development of Agenda 2000 and all these vital issues?"
"Regarding Scotland's seat: The Member States have been informed of the number of people that they can send to the Committee of the Regions, and the composition of these representatives on the Committee of the Regions is a decision of the national states."
"But, Mr Oreja, do you want to add something?"
"Madam President, I can only agree with what you have just said - and I am speaking in my capacity as Commissioner in charge of institutional affairs: this decision affects each of the Member States."
"That is the way the Committee of the Regions is made up."
"Personally, at the intergovernmental conference, I have always been a staunch defender of the Committee of the Regions."
"I think it plays a very important role."
"It seems very important to me that a region as important as Scotland should have an adequate and meaningful presence on the Committee."
"But this is a decision which affects Member States."
"They are the ones who decide who makes up this Committee."
"Madam President, I know that Mr Oreja has always defended the Committee of the Regions, its composition and the strength of this institution, and I would like to thank him for this."
"I also know that this stance is a question of the powers of the states."
"I would simply like to say that it would be appropriate if, from this House and with an eye to the future, in the next set of reforms we could work towards giving the Committee of the Regions greater influence - within all the regions and all the spheres of Europe - on the involvement and presence of those regions which depend upon legislative assemblies and therefore have a democratic power which controls them."
"Moreover, I am sure - based on the conviction of Mr Oreja, the Commissioner responsible for this area, who defends these proposals -that we will make noteworthy advances in the future."
"The debate is closed ."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.29 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 16 January 1998."
"Mr President, I would like to thank you for your comments regarding the terrible tragedy that plunged the French mountainside into mourning following the avalanche which took the lives of students from the Saint Francis of Assisi secondary school in Montigny-le Bretonneux, along with their teacher and an assistant."
"I am sure that, through you, Parliament will be unanimous in expressing its condolences to the families of the victims and in assuring the survivors, their families and the teaching profession of our sorrow and our solidarity."
"Thank you, Mr Bernard-Reymond."
"I think the applause speaks for itself."
"Mr President, I would like Parliament to thank His Holiness the Pope for the visit he made to Cuba, to thank this man whose ideal it has been to unite all the peoples of the world to give them the dignity which is their due."
"In addition, Mr President, I would like people to stop talking about Italy in terms of ""pizza' ."
"It is because of Italy that people are eating and enjoying it throughout the world!"
"Mr Mezzaroma, as I am sure you will understand, Parliament cannot make a statement on each and every one of the Pope's visits."
"That is not what we are here for."
"Mr President, I wish to draw the attention of yourself and Parliament to a recent episode which I consider to be extremely serious."
"A delegation made up of a number of European parliamentarians, including myself, from different political groups - although not an official parliamentary delegation, it arose out of the resolution unanimously approved last Thursday in Strasbourg concerning Mrs Karla Tucker who had been condemned to death and was in prison in Texas - was denied access to death row in Gatesville prison in Austin by the governor and prison authorities in Texas."
"They barred the way to a delegation which had arrived there on a purely humanitarian mission."
"Mr President, I am reporting this fact to the House as a very serious matter which demonstrates contempt, not just for the individual parliamentarians who decided to go on this mission, but for Parliament itself."
"Mr Caccavale, I have made a note of your remarks, and I will find out what happened so that appropriate measures can be taken, if necessary."
"Ladies and gentlemen, at the invitation of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, on 19 and 20 January I paid a visit to Northern Ireland."
"I had the opportunity of seeing for myself how the European Union is helping to bring new life to run-down areas of Belfast and, through the International Fund for Ireland, providing employment in some of the most sensitive areas of the city."
"I was also able to meet some of the families of the victims of the Troubles, who are receiving much-needed support under the European Union special partnership programme."
"At a time of great sensitivity for the peace process my visit provided the opportunity for the European Parliament, representing the people of Europe, to show its solidarity with all those in Northern Ireland, who are working for peace and reconciliation."
"I would like to take this opportunity of informing the House of the very real appreciation felt in Northern Ireland for the support of the European Union and, on your behalf, to show our support for the British and Irish Governments in their continuous search for peace."
"Mr President, I raise a point of order pursuant to Rules 127 and 52."
"You will recall that in September last year, this House decided to refer the whole issue of press intrusion and protection of personal privacy to committee."
"At that time it was felt too delicate a matter to be debated on the floor of the House."
"This is a serious European problem."
"It is now some five months from the date of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and nearly five months from the time Parliament referred it to committee."
"As far as I know, no committee of this House as yet has brought that to the floor."
"Could you give me an assurance that this important item will be debated by those committees with the utmost despatch?"
"Mr Perry, I cannot give you an assurance on behalf of the committee."
"What I can and will do immediately is remind the relevant committee chairmen of the matter which was referred to them and urge them to take the necessary measures and, if necessary, submit proposals to the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr President, you might write a letter to the relevant committee chairman on this point, but does this mean that the relevant committee chairman, or the relevant committee is sanctioned by the Conference of Presidents to submit an initiative?"
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, since you leapt in so quickly with your comment on the matter, you did not hear my last remark to Mr Perry, which was in fact that, in his case, authorization could be sought from the Conference of Presidents."
"So I can confirm what you have just asked ."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of Friday 16 January 1998 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I would like to mention that my name is not in the Minutes of the Strasbourg session on Friday, and I should like this to be corrected, as I added my name to the list and also took part in the voting that day, which can, of course, be checked."
"This is a big problem because the press has been handed a copy of the Minutes, unchecked and with my name missing from them."
"In Finland there has been a lot of controversy surrounding this issue."
"I would like to ask how the Minutes are matched with the names on the list, who is responsible for this, and how we are going to make sure that all the names down on the list also get into the Minutes, which are distributed to the public and the press."
"Mrs Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m, your comment will be taken into account and included in the Minutes."
"Mr President, I too have a comment to make on the Minutes, but I am sorry to say that it is a criticism. On Friday, the last day of the sitting in Strasbourg, I again referred to speakers' contributions on the subject of transalpine traffic, and at that point I introduced a clarification."
"Unfortunately, this has failed to appear. It is not because the comment I made is of special historic significance, but more for reasons of correctness, that I therefore repeat that, after the contributions of two German PPE Members, I was regrettably forced to say that there seems to me to be a race under way for the stupidest armchair tactician."
"I pointed this out again on Friday because I know that a large number of PPE Members and German Members - perhaps even the majority - can see further than the end of their noses when it comes to traffic policy and in this respect support a common approach to the problem."
"I am pleased to be able to say today that in the latest agreement with Switzerland the European caravan has also been pulled clear of these trivialities."
"I would ask that this be placed in the Minutes."
"Mr Rehder, in the first place, I have to tell you that what you are referring to is not a resolution."
"The Minutes record resolutions and incidents which need to be recorded there, not what the Members say."
"That appears in the verbatim report of proceedings, where you will be able to find your speech."
"Secondly, I would remind you that when Members of this House express themselves here they should observe the necessary levels of respect and politeness towards other Members."
"They can be critical if they feel that is appropriate, but always in accordance with the courtesy which should be maintained here."
"So of course, some of the words you used, at least as they were translated to me, are totally unacceptable."
"I want to make that absolutely clear."
"Mr President, I am sorry, but if my colleague here and in the Neue ZÃ¼richer Zeitung has been trying to ridicule two honorable Members of the PPE by referring to them as ""armchair tacticians' , then I can only say firstly, that the remark has made no impression, and secondly, that what matters is not armchair tactics but the interests of employees and businesses in the European Union - and in this respect he has got it wrong."
"If he is taking the Swiss side, then he fails to appreciate that many employees and many companies in the European Union have also been placed in a very difficult situation by the present compromise and it is high time that this was said."
"(Heckling: But no armchair tactics, please!)"
"That is not something which should be included in the Minutes."
"It will appear in the verbatim report of proceedings."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Financial crisis in South-East Asia"
"The next item is the Commission communication on the financial crisis in South-East Asia and its potential repercussions on economic and monetary union, followed by questions."
"- Thank you for the information, Mr Commissioner, although I do not know whether I should be thanking you or the crisis for having arisen and having been so positive."
"One of the concerns which is now increasing in intensity as we prepare for the introduction of the euro is that of inequality of impact and national or sector capacities for response."
"In some ways the so-called Asian crisis has proved the relevance of that concern in advance."
"For the various Member States, of course, the repercussions are and will be very different."
"And they will illustrate the difficulties that arise from the imposition of an artificial form of financial stability against a background of potential and existing unstable situations."
"At the sectorial level, I would quite specifically ask the Commissioner what he has to say about the present public reaction in Portugal to the effects already being suffered, and likely to be suffered more severely, by a significant sector of our economy, the textile industry, as a result of the Asian crisis, and the measures being recommended and put into practice?"
"Mr Commissioner, as you have just stated, not all European countries are affected in the same way by the Asian crisis, that is, neither the same industries, nor to the same extent."
"This crisis confronts those responsible for the economic policy of the Union with a choice in the face of the two possible consequences of the interdependence of flexibility and growth - one negative consequence combining Eurosclerosis with mediocre growth and one positive consequence combining liberalization of the economy with sustained growth."
"Given these conditions, do you not think that the time has come to consider the possibility of examining the criteria defined at Maastricht and consolidated in Amsterdam, through a global index which would allow each national policy the capacity for rapid adjustment in the case of a new crisis after 1st January 1999?"
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, EU-Russian relations are rapidly growing stronger."
"Relations with the Russian Federation are extremely important for the European Union, especially now that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement has come into effect."
"It is our pleasure today to welcome Mr Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of the Russian Communist Party, to the House. This is his first visit to the European Parliament and the other institutions of the European Union and he is seated in the official gallery."
"Financial crisis in South-East Asia (continuation)"
"Mr President, I speak as a Member of Parliament's ASEAN and Korean Delegation returning from Malaysia and Singapore last week."
"Are we aware that we need a wake-up call here in Europe to understand that the conflagration and contagion that is talked about in South East Asia could well come to Europe and elsewhere in the world?"
"I believe the Commission is showing complacency in this area."
"Secondly, I believe we are punching below our weight as the European Union."
"Let me give you two very quick examples: Mr Santer's visit to Singapore sank without trace compared to the visits by American personnel concerned with the financial crisis to that part of the world."
"As Mr de Silguy has pointed out, it is little recognized that 30 % of the IMF support comes from the European Union and only 18 % from the United States of America."
"When you are over there, all you would understand is that the United States of America is helping that part of the world to resolve this global crisis, not Europe."
"When are we going to get off of our backsides and do something about it?"
"Mr President, I am in agreement with half of what Mr Harrison says."
"I agree with him when he says that the European Union is punching below its weight."
"On the other hand, I do not agree when he says that the Commission is showing complacency."
"I could have great fun with you here, going through all the possible and imaginable nightmare scenarios."
"When I was young, I was told, if wishes were horses beggars would ride."
"Well, if there were more horses and fewer beggars, maybe beggars would ride."
"But I refuse to devote myself to these types of nightmare scenarios."
"I prefer to react, to act and to analyse the facts."
"On a business level there will be cross-sectorial impacts but with the current state of things these cannot be considered as having a major effect on the European economy of the susceptible industrial sectors as a whole."
"Exports from these sectors towards Asia, in total, represent less than 1 % of Community GNP."
"A second source of propagation: the financial sector."
"Indeed, I spoke earlier about the involvement of the European banks in Asia."
"It is clear that those banks are today in the middle of a process of renegotiating and scheduling the debts of these countries and, in any case, most of them, the vast majority even, have the financial muscle to enable them to withstand a certain number of shocks."
"Consequently, when I consider that the main part of our banking involvement is in Hong Kong, Singapore and China, that is, the countries least affected by the crisis and which are the soundest and the best managed, and that the other countries, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, are precisely those which have received conditional aid packages from the International Monetary Fund, I do consider that the crisis is 'manageable', as you would say in your mother tongue, but I do not want to make ambitious plans."
"Mr President, I too agree absolutely with all that the Commissioner said about the magnitude of the impact of the crisis on the European Union."
"We ought not to exaggerate so far as the facts are concerned, and he is absolutely right to analyse the issue as he has."
"I would like to ask him to tell me something else since we are talking about South-East Asia, if I may."
"What is happening in Japan?"
"There, matters could develop in ways that might surprise us."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner if any moves have been made towards coordinated action by European and American financing bodies and by the central banks, of course, to deal in a coordinated way with the eventuality that Japan might start liquidating its investments, particularly those in the form of government or other bonds, especially on the American market?"
"Is that currently the subject of any discussion by the European Commission?"
"Has any initiative been adopted in that area, in the event that developments might possibly create problems for us?"
"Thank you for having asked a question regarding Japan, Mr Christodoulou, because it is today the country in the system which should be followed the most closely."
"I note that Japan continues determinedly to play its role in the Asian crisis, since it is holding on to its existing credit in the countries it is involved in, it is maintaining its lines of credit open to its main business partners and it is also assuring bilateral assistance and participating in multilateral aid efforts."
"Consequently, Japan is not about to withdraw or to shut itself off from the rest of the world, which is a positive factor."
"Secondly, and this is a point on which we greatly insist in our contacts with them, the Japanese have undertaken a series of measures concerning deregulation of their markets, restructuring, tax relief, as well as different measures to guarantee the banking system in order to prevent bankruptcy."
"At the end of last year, a reduction in income tax, valid until March 1998, was even announced."
"To me, this assumes that, first and foremost, on a structural level they are determined to resolve the problems in their financial and banking systems, with our help should they need it."
"And secondly, that if they need to, they will not hesitate to take the necessary measures to revive growth through - and I insist on this point - domestic demand."
"We must make sure that they do not try to turn the countries of America and Europe into their lifeline and way out, that is to say, by passing their incapacity to sort out their own problems on to Europe."
"We must be vigilant as regards our methods, failing a presence and voice on the international scene."
"Mr President, I would like to take up the last remark made by the Commissioner and put it into the context of his initial analysis."
"He introduced an analysis of the effects of the Asian crisis on the European economy through the medium of European export shares to Asia as a proportion of our GNP."
"Could I ask him to focus some attention on the import side."
"There is the question of Asia's exports to Europe and Asia competing with European products in third countries with devalued exchange rates."
"His macro-analysis is too partial if he simply sticks to exports or refers to sectoral aspects of imports."
"This is a critical issue in respect of the effect on the European economy."
"I regret to say I do not share the presumed optimism of the Commissioner's response to the last question."
"He said that he hopes the Asian economies will not seek to trade their way out of this crisis on our markets and that they will instead develop domestic demand."
"Their quickest fix is to use their lower exchange rates to flood our markets."
"He has left that out of the equation and should put it in."
"Mr Harrison raised the point that we are punching below our weight."
"We have thirty per cent IMF Mr President, zero per cent profile."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the tiger economies have always been presented misleadingly as the sacred cow of neoliberalism."
"Now they are proving to be speculative casino economies which have also failed to exorcize the ghost of deflation."
"This brings us to the problem of bank supervision as a public responsibility."
"All previous talk has focused exclusively on the wrongs committed by public bodies."
"But this crisis is all about the private sector."
"Should it not give us real cause for concern that in the future area of currency unification, responsibility for monetary policy and responsibility for bank supervision are to be kept separate?"
"The European Central Bank is responsible for monetary policy."
"The national central banks, if at all, will continue to be responsible for bank supervision."
"Is this not a fundamental weakness in the system and one which much be addressed before we start?"
"Should we not be coordinating our policy of bank supervision and bringing about greater coordination in our economic policy in general, so that we can resolve the problems being posed by currency union?"
"Mr President, I find it difficult to reply to Mr Wolf."
"People will again say that my efforts are being put to things other than my work."
"It is really a question for the European Central Bank and the European Monetary Institute."
"I would not want to do something other than that which is requested of me as Commissioner in terms of launching the euro."
"Your question poses, after all, a much wider problem."
"For in Europe, whether control and monitoring is exercised by the Central Bank or by national banks, it is done according to criteria, standards and norms which are satisfactory and very protective."
"The problem is to see how these norms and standards can be extended to the countries of South-East Asia and how entities such as the Bank for International Settlements or other mechanisms can be put in place to ensure that the current crisis will end in the adoption, in these countries, of regulatory and supervisory rules which are sufficient to ensure the security of the whole world."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the Asian financial crisis affects us in Europe."
"If we look at exchange rate turmoil and monetary speculation as a sign of the liberalization of capital transactions, then under such circumstances should we in the European Union not be considering, within the framework of the International Monetary Fund, the establishment of a better system of international credit transparency and the possible need for an international credit insurance system? This would ensure that events of the kind we are now witnessing could not happen in economies like the tiger states, which, according to macro-economic figures, are in a healthy state."
"Is every part of the world really safe from such events?"
"We await the Commission's answer to this question."
"I myself am waiting for the Commission to show greater initiative in the current situation so that we can begin to take this part of the world seriously."
"Why, for example, is there no EU delegation in Singapore or Malaysia?"
"Such a body would certainly help raise the EU's low profile in this region."
"And would it not also serve to enhance our credibility if the European Union could send a special envoy to South-East Asia, as the US President has done?"
"Mrs Randzio-Plath, I note your suggestion regarding Singapore and Malaysia."
"I will bring it to the attention of my colleagues who are directly responsible for this issue."
"I would like to reply to your question regarding the IMF: should an international insurance system be put in place?"
"This really seems to me to be the role of the International Monetary Fund."
"You may consider that it acts too slowly, or that it acts too fast; that there is not enough conditionality, that there is too much conditionality."
"That is another question."
"And this role which it fulfils, moreover, is truly a role of assistance, I was going to say the role of a fireman, in the case of disaster or fire."
"I think that the real solution in these countries lies, firstly, in breaking the overtight link that exists between governments and banks."
"Secondly, the solution lies in defining ad-hoc standards of financial and institutional supervision which must be the same in these countries as they are in ours."
"Thirdly, the solution lies in the recapitalization of their banks, an action which must at the same time be complemented by cleaning up their assets."
"Fourthly, and this is essential, the issue must be solved independently of any insurance, to make the system more transparent, in the accounts of these banks."
"And finally, it is appropriate - and is, in fact, the path which is being taken, for a lot is said about crisis but little about the plans currently being implemented - to liberalize the financial sectors of these countries, in order to give foreign institutions the possibility of operating there."
"Madam President, the Commission's account of the economic crisis in South-East Asia was indeed very interesting, as the replies have been, but I think it is too optimistic as far as long-term effects are concerned."
"Why is this?"
"Firstly, their wounded international competitiveness will grow considerably whether their currencies are devalued or devalue automatically."
"This is also taking place with other Eastern countries."
"Secondly, the East has already cancelled orders from certain European countries, including Finland, which might have some considerable effect on their economies."
"Thirdly, prices on the stock exchange are jumping up and down, reflecting the general concern."
"All these effects may be experienced differently in the various Member States."
"That is why I would like to ask whether, if the worst comes to the worst, the Commission intends to plan a course of increased latitude, economically speaking, towards these countries which might well be plunged into crisis."
"I would like to be completely clear on this point, Mr Ilaskivi."
"I repeat, I am not ignoring the consequences of - to simplify the matter - low cost imports coming from these countries on our economies."
"But, contrary to what you think, the devaluation of their exchange rates is not only an advantage for them, far from it."
"Firstly, they will pay more for imported goods, such as the need, for example in Korea, for scrap iron or iron ore or coal in order to make steel."
"They have to import this."
"And if you have devalued, you are going to pay more."
"You will therefore lose out in terms of competitiveness."
"Secondly, they will lose in inflationary terms, because their inflation rates will rise."
"Thirdly, they will perhaps be driven to produce less."
"Indeed, what guarantee do we have today that they will be able to continue to export at the same level if the financial ties and the credit which they have with their own banks, due to the situation of their financial system, disappears and the possibility of credit dries up."
"I could continue to give you more such examples."
"This is why we must not dramatise the situation and we must remain confident."
"We are undertaking a sector by sector study, and in the time left to me I cannot specify the eight or ten sectors in detail."
"But when this study is finished, I will be happy to ask for it to be passed on to you."
"You will see in detail that, sector by sector, there are of course some areas which will be more affected than others, but, I already note that, particularly in the financial field, the overseas branches of certain large European companies have already provided for what they consider to be a loss."
"Consequently, this will perhaps affect their profitability a little, but it will not challenge their existence in Europe."
"Madam President, we note with satisfaction that the Commission is following the developments very closely, but we cannot escape the impression that the big absentee in Asia today is Europe, and more specifically, the European Union."
"This contrasts sharply with the United States' efforts in that part of the world."
"We stand noticeably aloof, but I also have the impression that the individual Member States, or at least some of them, obviously the biggest ones, are trying to protect their own interests in the Asian crisis."
"Nevertheless, major financial and economic interests are at stake for Europe, to say nothing of the political aspects, because no one will dispute that the divided attitude amongst the European countries and the absence of the European Union as such will hardly reinforce the impression in Asia that Europe is a strong unit and that Europe is a homogeneous entity."
"That is not really the impression they have, and we should regret this."
"Madam President, I totally agree with Mr De Clercq."
"I am in complete agreement with his analysis, and I will even go further by quoting another example which seems to me to be particularly revealing of the situation described."
"Last December, at the time of the emergency package for Korea, on Christmas Eve, in the hours before the Nativity, four Member States of the Union, the four members of the G7, were called on to provide bilateral aid to the country in question, which was essential to enable Korea to complete the year."
"As far as one can judge, this contribution was probably as important as that of the Americans."
"However, the impression is given that it was the Americans who sorted out the crisis."
"This is the reason why I said to Mr De Clercq earlier on, Madam President, that inasmuch as the euro offered us some protection even before its existence, when it comes into use, we will need to be strong and capable enough to express ourselves with one voice, in order not only to play a constructive role - not only to be a funder - but to have a role of real influence, which lives up, firstly, to our significant financial contribution, which will continue, and secondly, which lives up to our importance in economic, financial and commercial circles throughout the world."
"It seems to me that from next year this will be the major challenge for the euro, for Europe and for Europeans."
"Madam President, I would like to ask two questions."
"You just said, Mr Commissioner, that it is essential for Europe to speak with one voice when the euro comes into effect."
"Does this mean that the Member States linked to the euro will lose their representation in the IMF in favour of one ""European Union' representation or one '' euro countries' representation?"
"My second question is the following: last week, in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, we heard the Director General of the IMF speak of his solution which, in macroeconomic terms, would probably give tangible results."
"But the President of the World Bank told us that in human terms, in terms of unemployment and in terms of an increase in poverty, there will also be catastrophic results."
"I would like to ask if the Commission is going to examine this problem and if we are ready to participate in the social and human programmes of the World Bank?"
"Mr Commissioner, I have clearly understood the relative optimism that you demonstrate with regard to the consequences of the Asian crisis on the European economy."
"You have already mentioned it several times."
"Nevertheless, I sense some variations which leave me somewhat mindful of the balance between autosuggestion and deep conviction."
"However, my question is more industrial and related more to international competition."
"Competition in textiles was mentioned earlier."
"I would like to raise a question regarding shipbuilding."
"Do you know that we are currently in a period of extension of a European Directive on aid to the shipbuilding industry, to take into account the non-ratification of an international agreement?"
"Do you not think that the current crisis will also have important consequences for this problem of agreements not being ratified, and that we should protect ourselves at the level of our own texts and our own decisions on aid to our European industries?"
"I repeat, it would seem completely unacceptable to allow the situation to deteriorate in Korea but also unacceptable that our shipyards should have to suffer the direct consequences."
"This said, with particular regard to shipbuilding, it is now likely that the Korean industry will have to reduce its capacity, because some shipyards may find themselves in difficult financial circumstances if they do not get the required financing."
"Indeed, in the IMF agreement certain, rather vague preconditions exist whose terms state that no sectoral governmental agreement on the transfer of financing for such and such an industrial sector is possible."
"It furthermore explicitly anticipates that, for Chaebol in particular, the standards, accounts, norms and financial year of that company should be put in order."
"A number of preconditions are therefore foreseen, certainly perhaps not enough in your eyes, but ones which move towards both a greater liberalization of the financial markets in these countries, and also the suppression of specific advantages which the Korean shipyards have in relation to other yards."
"It will be seen that one of the consequences of the crisis in Korea will be precisely the challenging of the personal, financial, structural and even political links which exist between the industrial and the banking sectors."
"This will be the end of the large conglomerates, which must effectively embark upon a process of dismantling, of which we will have to take advantage."
"Let me furthermore add that today many owners or shipowners seem, for obvious reasons, rather hesitant to place orders with Korea."
"But, in this respect, we are also following the situation closely and it is one of the susceptible sectors on which our current studies are particularly concentrating."
"Madam President, the one thing that has come across this afternoon is how the Commission is largely a disinterested observer."
"We have had a very cosmetic exercise by Commissioner de Silguy.I would like to ask him several questions."
"Is there any risk of dumping in the European economy from the devaluation of these currencies in the Far East?"
"Are any specific industries at risk, for example the micro-electronics industry and the microchip industry?"
"Has there been any representation made to the Commission by any specific European industry about the devaluation?"
"Has the European Commission made any representation to the Chinese regarding the devaluation of their currency which sparked this crisis?"
"Is there a risk of a further devaluation?"
"Exactly what special arrangements are the European Commission and the European Union making to act quickly in the event of a domino effect in the US markets and indeed in the European markets?"
"Mr Commissioner, we thank you for the answers you have given to our colleagues' questions."
"The debate is now closed."
"Compatibility of political mandate and office of Commissioner"
"The next item is a declaration from the Commission on the compatibility of political mandate and the office of Commissioner."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to make a very clear political statement that in our view it is completely incompatible for a Member of the Commission to hold any party political post whichever part of the political spectrum a particular Commissioner may come from."
"That is our position."
"Mr Santer has said in his statement that Commissioners have a political function; we agree with him."
"We do not deny and fully understand that the Commission has an eminently political role."
"We believe however that it is entirely incompatible with the impartiality with which we expect Commissioners to carry out their functions that they should take part in party political campaigns for personal election."
"Since we requested this statement, the specific issue which caused all of us in this House great concern has been solved."
"We welcome the fact that Commissioner de Silguy has withdrawn as a potential candidate from the French regional elections."
"We believe that it is entirely right and we hope that in so doing he has enabled the Commission to deal with this very sensitive and important issue once and for all."
"In that context I welcome very much President Santer's statement on behalf of the Commission today."
"It demonstrates at least some ambiguity in the concept of independence which we all expect from the Commission that any Commissioner should have considered it possible to stand for election in this way."
"I hope President Santer that you will use this incident to get complete agreement within the College of Commissioners."
"We are looking for a code of conduct along the lines of your interpretation."
"Certainly the interpretation that you have expressed here today is completely in tune with the great majority of this House."
"I must say that in this Parliament we have learned an important lesson that perhaps we could have well done with when we had the public hearing before we ratified this Commission."
"Certainly we have learned important lessons for the public hearing before the ratification of the next Commission."
"We will all be asking very important questions of all Commissioners when they come before us for ratification next time around."
"We need to be absolutely sure that there is a commitment from them to ensure independence and impartiality in the performance of their work on behalf of European citizens."
"In view of the withdrawal of Mr de Silguy from potential candidature in the French regional elections and the statement by Mr Santer this afternoon, my group felt it important to say clearly that we have withdrawn the motion for a resolution which we tabled and we give notice that we will not support any resolutions that come before the House tomorrow."
"We very much value the statement you have made Mr Santer; we hope that there will be complete agreement from the College of Commissioners to the interpretation which you have put here today."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I totally approve of the terms of the declaration which the President of the Commission has just made."
"I will thus limit myself to three brief observations and comments."
"My first observation: I would like to congratulate Mr de Silguy for his honourable decision not to stand in the local elections since, effectively, as President Santer has noted, no text formally obliges him to renounce this."
"Mr de Silguy has put his European responsibilities, and in particular the essential role he is currently playing in the implementation of the euro, before his political ambition."
"And I think we should pay special tribute to him for his behaviour."
"This is all the more so given that some people, previously, given the same choice, did not have the same attitude, nor the same honour."
"The situation of another French Commissioner was earlier mentioned, who remained Mayor of ChÃ¢tellerault, Councillor for the department of Vienne, which is extremely similar to that of the role of a regional councillor, a role which that Commissioner has just resigned from after a very short period of time."
"There is another case, perhaps less well known, but which is even more worrying, which is that of your predecessor, Mr President of the Commission."
"At a time when he was exercising the distinguished role which is today yours, he did not hesitate to head the list of candidates for the local elections of Clichy, which is an important town close to Paris, only to be elected Mayor. He later resigned, of course."
"But he was a candidate and he was heavily involved in the electoral campaign, with all the power bestowed upon him through his role as President of the Commission."
"I note that on this point I am in agreement with Mrs Green who considers that if Commissioners have the right to continue political activity, if they had it in the first place, they should not involve themselves too overtly in national and electoral campaigns."
"I note that, in fact, the behaviour I have just described is not in line with what we should expect."
"My third observation is that I am indeed happy that, following Mr de Silguy's gesture and this debate - although I would have liked to have had the same debate regarding the previous cases - we may now come up with a clear rule."
"You have expressed it clearly, Mr President, and I hope that from now on, this clear rule will be imposed on all, not only on a Commissioner who is at the origin of this new ethical rule, but that it is a uniform rule which from now on will be followed by all Commissioners."
"Madam President, this debate creates an important constitutional precedent."
"As President Santer has recalled, European Commissioners fulfil a political function and are not technocrats, since they are politically responsible to our directly-elected Parliament."
"For that reason, it is also important that increasingly politicians and not technocrats are nominated."
"This Commission only has two Commissioners who have never held a political office; one of them was Mr de Silguy."
"Article 157 of the Treaty states - and we all recognise now - that we must have clear independence and that Commissioners cannot accept any instructions, nor should Member States or even Heads of States of Member States give any instructions to this body."
"All this is very important because during their term in office that is the only guarantee that they are independent."
"For my group the text of the Treaty is abundantly clear."
"A political function exercised in the general interest is incompatible with any party political function, whether at national, regional or local level and I am very glad that the President has confirmed it in such clear terms."
"The only query one might have is: was it not possible for the Commission to have done this before?"
"It is very clear that this Parliament, and the pressure from this Parliament, was the main reason why Commissioner de Silguy had to withdraw and not pursue this issue, rather than perhaps debate in the Commission."
"But let us leave that aside."
"I would now like to look towards the future and as President Santer has said, it is important also for future Commissions to take this attitude."
"Indeed Madam Cresson accepted this principle rather belatedly, which we may regret."
"But it is now more important that we in this House establish this as a firm rule for the future with the agreement of the President of the Commission."
"Mr Santer, could you perhaps, in preparation for the investiture of the new Commission, draw up a code of conduct as was suggested so that in the future no doubts remain about the composition of the body?"
"Then there would be clarity and that in turn would strengthen the Commission."
"One final point: it would be very welcome if Parliament at some stage looked at its own situation."
"We should also look at the various aspects of dual mandates in this Parliament for the future."
"As the European Union gains strength, as the representative character of the Community gains strength, not only the Commission but also the Parliament must, in certain respects, clarify the position for the future."
"So we should not be too hypocritical about the past of this Commission and I hope that this debate has served as an important precedent for us also."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to us this is very clearly a question of principles, and most definitely not individuals."
"In that sense we are satisfied with the statement made by Commissioner Santer, and we fully support its general direction."
"It is rather obvious that the mandate of European Commissioner cannot be linked to national, regional or even local mandates, because loyalties are created which lead to regional, local or national loyalties clashing with the European mandate they were given here."
"I have to say, totally in line with what Mr Brinkhorst declared here a few moments ago, that we are also the party asking the questions, so that the Commission might give itself a code of conduct which is interpreted specifically enough, because Mr Santer was very explicit in relation to the national and regional mandates, but much less so as regards the local ones."
"Yet the precedent was set."
"A mandate at the level of mayorship of an important city is in our opinion incompatible with the function of European Commissioner."
"As far as that is concerned we are the party asking the questions."
"I have one last point, ladies and gentlemen."
"I think it is great pity that all groups, apart from ours here, have decided to withdraw their resolutions."
"Surely it is not because now that the individual question is off the boil, the fundamental opinion of this Parliament ceases to have any significance?"
"All demands which have been made in the various speeches I have heard have been perfectly reflected in our motion for a resolution."
"We would very much like to urge support, and we are openly in favour of oral amendments, should one or two details not be right."
"It is important that Parliament not only speaks, but decides on the basis of a text."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the question of the exercise of a political mandate by a Commissioner, or more correctly one Commissioner's desire to solicit a political mandate has been raised."
"Mr de Silguy has abandoned his ambition towards the mandate in question, for reasons which he explained with loyalty and frankness."
"You could be forgiven for thinking that this solves the problem."
"In reality, the question raised is that of the exercise, by Commissioners, of functions other than those for which they were appointed, whether it be a question of a political mandate or a professional activity."
"In this respect it seems to me that the past or current activities of Commissioners other than Mr de Silguy do, however, pose a serious problem."
"Indeed, Commissioners are civil servants, whose duty it is to watch over the implementation of the Treaty. They are chosen by virtue of their overall competence and should offer every guarantee of independence."
"This is stated in paragraph 1 of Article 157 of the Treaty."
"Paragraph 2 states that Members of the Commission are fully independent in the exercise of their role, in the general interest of the Community; that they neither request nor accept instructions from any government nor body and that they refrain from any deed incompatible with the character of their role."
"Do you think, Mr President, that these measures are really respected?"
"Your predecessor, Mr Delors, was a local councillor."
"Mr Pasty mentioned it earlier on."
"During his mandated period as President of the Commission he actively participated in French political life to the point where it was rumoured that he aspired to become President of France in 1995."
"Mrs Cresson was a candidate for a third term as Mayor in 1995."
"She has always been very active within the leadership of the French Socialist party."
"It is said that one of your Commissioners participates in certain meetings of his government, that many Commissioners participate in meetings of the Group of the European People's Party and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, outside of those which take place at the European Parliament, that another is Vice-Chancellor of a university in his country, which leads him to go home several times each month."
"Recently, I was offended that Mrs Bonino was able to participate in a Pacific Forum, where the independence of New Caledonia was an issue, which is an integral part of one of the Member States, France."
"I would therefore like to ask, Mr President, for a careful examination of the personal situation of each and every one of the Commissioners, to make sure they are fully respecting the Treaty."
"Paid out of the Community budget, and therefore out of the taxes of every Member State, the Commissioners must exercise their functions on a full-time basis, as you said yourself, without having any other political activities beyond those of an ordinary citizen, and with no other professional activity."
"Madam President, I too welcome Mr Santer's statement."
"He has clarified it in the right way, not in the way that Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has just said."
"He is wrong to say the Commissioners are simply officials."
"Mr FabreAubrespy should read the Treaty and the Statutes."
"It makes a clear distinction between officials of the institutions and the Members of the institution."
"The 20 Commissioners form a political executive."
"They are politicians and, indeed, the title of the debates and statement today to that extent is wrong."
"It says that it is a statement on the compatibility of political office with the duties of Member of the Commission."
"But membership of the Commission is a political office."
"Like Ministers, they are appointed by Prime Ministers."
"To take office they need the confidence of this House in a vote of confidence."
"When they are in office they have to answer questions before this House and they can be dismissed by a vote of no confidence of Parliament - and only by a vote of no confidence of the European Parliament."
"Thus, the Commission forms a political executive accountable to this House and it is important for this House that it is recognized as such."
"They are not officials working for the Council as some Eurosceptics would have us believe."
"They are politically answerable in their own right."
"The debate then is not one of them being politicians but one of what other political offices they may hold."
"It is a question of double mandates."
"It is a question of cumul de mandats ."
"There we need to look very carefully, as has been done in the debate."
"Nobody quibbles that Commissioners are members of political parties."
"They participate in political parties and come to our group meetings."
"That is very welcome."
"There is some debate as to whether they should be mayors of small towns."
"There are precedents on that."
"It is debatable and I think the debate is moving against that in modern times."
"But there are certainly major questions of them holding the presidency of a major European region which receives funds from the European Union."
"And I am astonished that Mr De Silguy even considered that possibility."
"I congratulate Mr Santer on having brought order within his team in the Commission and having made a very clear statement today."
"Madam President, I also wish to express a personal view."
"It seems to me that half the problem has been that each Commissioner has made up his own mind on a personal basis and we now need a set of rules."
"You might contrast President Santer's welcoming of Mr de Silguy's decision to stand down as a candidate for the Breton Regional Council which he said 'did him credit' with the position of Sir Leon Brittan, for example, who presented himself by letter to every British citizen in Brussels before the last election asking them to vote Conservative and to contribute money to the Conservative Party."
"Perhaps one should give him credit for attempting the impossible but, nevertheless, it calls into question his judgment."
"We cannot leave it to Commissioners to decide what they are going to do, and what is acceptable, on a mix-and-match basis."
"We have had statements from a number of political groups."
"The Socialists say it is incompatible to hold any party-political post or take part in partypolitical campaigns although apparently - we hear from Mr Corbett - it is okay to attend group meetings."
"Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo said that the Commission is political but that the Commissioners are not party political."
"Mr Brinkhorst for the Liberals said that no party-political role is permissible."
"So we have a range of options and it is about time that the Commission got its act together."
"The Commission we vote in needs to have the confidence of this House but, more importantly, Europe needs to be confident that these are not part-time politicians being a Commissioner for a few years but people who put Europe at the heart of their job and are prepared to renounce everything else in the meantime."
"Mr Macartney was our last speaker in this debate and I give the floor to President Santer to conclude."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply like to thank those who have spoken and say how pleased I am with the manner in which this declaration has been discussed."
"Indeed, a certain number of questions can be raised, but I believe that the members of the Commission must be independent."
"What I do dispute the validity of is the idea that members of the Commission must be senior civil servants."
"No, these are politicians, with a political mandate, who are responsible to the European Parliament..."
"... and so themselves assume political responsibilities."
"Furthermore, if after 25 years as a member of a government and 11 years as Prime Minister, I was told that from now on I would be a civil servant, the idea would not occur to me to agree to this, even as President of the Commission."
"I would never have agreed to this."
"Therefore, according to the unanimous wishes of the European Council who appointed me President of the Commission, I perform my duties as a political representative before a responsible parliament, the European Parliament."
"I believe that this is essential."
"Furthermore, I also clearly dispute the validity of those tendencies which want to deny members of the Commission even the most basic rights which are reserved for citizens."
"Citizens themselves have a right to political convictions, to belong to a political party, to stand as candidates in elections."
"Why could civil servants, or even politicians or members of the Commission not do this in the same capacity as any citizen?"
"We do not live in an ivory tower."
"I have never considered the Breydel as a palace, as some have suggested."
"I have always considered it more like a hospital."
"Nor would I like it to become an ivory tower where the Commissioners hide themselves away, out of touch with political reality."
"I believe we have a political mandate and we must carry out this political mandate according to our convictions, while exercising our fundamental rights as citizens."
"I believe that it is in this spirit that my declaration must be looked at."
"On the one hand, there is the duty of the Commissioners and the President of the Commission to be independent, as recognized by Article 157 of the Treaty, but on the other hand, there is the possibility for a Commissioner, or the President of the Commission, to reveal his political opinions and to be answerable for them before you."
"Racism"
"The next item is the submission of oral questions, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, to the Council (B4-1010/97-0-0112/97) and to the Commission (B4-1011/97-0-0113/97) concerning the annual debate on racism."
"Madam President, thank you for that kind introduction."
"It is a great pleasure for me to have the opportunity of addressing Parliament today on this particular subject."
"Having been a Member of this Parliament for ten years, I count myself a keen supporter of Parliament's work and, in particular, I am aware of Parliament's long-standing interest in tackling the problems of racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism."
"Indeed, I should like to take the opportunity of congratulating Members for all they have done to get this issue firmly onto the European agenda."
"In addition to the essential role which national governments must play in combating racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism within their borders, I am in no doubt that there is also a crucial role for European action."
"The Council - and, indeed, the presidency - will continue to work energetically and enthusiastically with you for positive policies in this field at European level."
"One of the first tasks is to evaluate the effect of the joint action of 15 July 1996 concerning measures to combat racism and xenophobia."
"By the end of June this year the Council will need to assess the fulfilment by Member States of their obligations under the joint action."
"You will recall that Member States have undertaken to ensure effective judicial cooperation in respect of offences based on racist behaviour."
"The Council which will be held on 28 and 29 May will therefore examine a report on the measures taken or planned by the Member States in the fight against racism."
"As you will know, our two institutions took the opportunity to confirm our common concern about racism at the opening and closing conferences of the European Year against Racism in The Hague and in Luxembourg."
"We believe that the European Year was an important step forward."
"It made a valuable contribution to raising awareness of the problems of racism across the Union and to encouraging work to tackle those problems and to highlighting the benefits of our diverse societies."
"I know that in my own country, the UK, events were held on an almost daily basis by a wide range of organizations up and down the country."
"When we made government funding available to support projects marking the European Year we received a large number of applications."
"The Public Information Unit set up by the Commission for Racial Equality in the UK was inundated with inquiries."
"This showed clear evidence of the interest, the enthusiasm and the commitment at grassroots level."
"I know that this was also in evidence in other Member States."
"Governments must take note of the strength of feeling that the European Year showed."
"The Year must not be seen as a one-off."
"Its momentum must not be lost."
"I agree with what Mr Mohammed Ali just said that we are not interested in just indulging in rhetoric."
"We need to make sure that the momentum is maintained over the coming months and years."
"Continuity has been well prepared by the Council and by the European Council during 1997."
"There have been two declarations by the Council on the fight against racism in the fields of youth and education."
"The Council Regulation of 2 June established a European monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia and the Amsterdam Treaty contains measures which are important in this respect."
"All are important steps which provide a foundation for further initiatives to combat the different forms of discrimination."
"The two declarations which were adopted by the Council and by representatives of the governments of the Member States dealt with the importance of measures in the youth field and in the field of education."
"They also stressed the need to build upon the achievements of the European Year."
"We will all agree that one of the most significant achievements of the European Year was the agreement to establish a European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna."
"I know that this Parliament has long supported the idea of such a centre and that your representative Glyn Ford was a key figure on the Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia which did so much of the groundwork."
"I know too, and welcome the fact, that Parliament's involvement with the Centre will continue."
"The Centre has the potential to make a real practical difference."
"Working closely with the Council of Europe it will contribute to the necessary exchange of information and pooling of experience."
"I am sure that it will prove invaluable to the Member States and to the Community institutions."
"The Centre has now started its work."
"The management board met last week and elected Mr Jean Kahn as its chairman."
"This is very appropriate given the enormous efforts of Mr Kahn to bring the monitoring centre into being and I am sure that Members of this Parliament will wish to join me in congratulating Mr Kahn on this appointment and in wishing him a speedy and full recovery from his current illness."
"In looking ahead to the future, we have to consider the impact of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"There are two key elements to the Treaty which are of particular relevance to this debate, ."
"The Treaty introduced into the text of the Treaty on European Union the task of preventing and suppressing racism and xenophobia in the new Article 29."
"The new Article 13 provides a legal base for Community action to combat racial discrimination."
"These new provisions will facilitate our work to step up the fight against discrimination based on race or ethnic origin."
"When the ratification procedures for the Amsterdam Treaty are concluded, the Council will give priority to rapid implementation of that Treaty."
"I know that Commissioner Flynn has already announced that the Commission is preparing an action plan to combat racism and xenophobia."
"The Council looks forward to the Commission's proposals for building on the advances made in the Year and we look forward to working with the Commission on them."
"The UK presidency, in particular, wants to maintain the momentum in this area."
"We need to build upon achievements to date and look ahead to the potential of the new provisions of the Treaty."
"We need to consider there both legislative and non-legislative options."
"The UK will be holding a seminar towards the end of our presidency which will provide an opportunity to focus on these important issues and to look at the way ahead."
"We have come some considerable way already but there is still a great deal to do."
"The Council is determined not to shirk its responsibilities and looks forward to working with you and with the Commission, not just to tackle the evils which still blight our countries but also to find ways of celebrating the diversity from which we all draw so many benefits."
". Mr President, the honourable Member refers to the efforts of the Commission to combat racism in 1997 and to what has been done to comply with the recommendations put forward by the European Parliament in its resolution of 30 January 1997."
"The Commission worked intensively in 1997 to implement the European Year against Racism and to promote non-discrimination."
"The official closing conference of the European Year in Luxembourg last December underlined the success of the Year in terms of the political impact it had and the momentum it created, and also its achievements in raising awareness and in forging new partnerships and new networks throughout the Union."
"One of the key political achievements during 1997 was the inclusion of the general anti-discrimination clause within the Amsterdam Treaty in Article 13."
"Following the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty and building upon what was accomplished during the European Year and subsequently, I can say to you today that it is my firm intention to come forward with proposals for anti-discrimination legislation before the end of this Commission."
"Another lasting result from 1997 was the adoption of the regulation governing the establishment of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia which was referred to by the Minister, Mrs Quin."
"The first meeting of the management board took place in Vienna on 20 and 21 January and it is expected that the centre will be fully operational in the autumn of this year."
"Finally, the closing conference highlighted one of the key results of the European Year which has been the joint action and cooperation between the European institutions."
"The presence of the President-in-Office of the Council, the President of the Commission and the VicePresident of the European Parliament as speakers at that event is good testimony to this."
"In this context the Commission welcomes the fact that the European Parliament continues to recognize the importance of the fight against racism, including its annual debate as part of this mini-session."
"The European Year against Racism had two main strands. It focused firstly on information and communication, and secondly on the exchange of experience."
"In this way a broad range of activities were promoted as recommended by the European Parliament, ranging from essentially local and regional projects to high-profile events with television coverage right across the world."
"In total some 177 projects received grant support."
"Every effort was made to ensure that funding was provided for projects that reached citizens at grassroots level and involved ethnic minority and immigration groups in defining needs and in developing appropriate action."
"Following the Year against Racism the Commission will continue to build on the partnerships that were established or strengthened during the year, including those with anti-racism nongovernmental organizations, with the social partners, the media, sports bodies and political parties."
"In particular, 1997 saw the emergence of a European platform of anti-racism non-governmental organizations."
"I would like to think that we can work together on this important development in the years to come."
"The European Year was just the beginning - a good beginning but just the beginning."
"It has shown not only what needs to be done but also what can be done."
"It is my firm intention to continue to drive forward the European fight against racism."
"I intend very shortly to present an action plan against racism which will build upon the achievements and lessons learned during the European Year of 1997 and pave the way for legislative proposals once the Amsterdam Treaty has been ratified."
"I look forward to receiving your continued support in this issue which is of such importance to all Europe's citizens."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mohamed Ali on his report."
"Secondly, I congratulate the Commission for the European Year against Racism which in our opinion was an outstanding success."
"From Madrid to Manchester and from Barcelona to Berlin there were thousands of different events, some funded by the Commission, some by Member States and some by no one at all."
"Some people were so keen to get involved they found the money and organized events for themselves."
"I also, in particular, thank Commissioner Flynn for his dedication and commitment to pushing this issue up the agenda."
"The promise he made first in Marseilles and now again today to introduce anti-discrimination legislation before the end of 1999 is extremely welcome."
"Thirdly, I congratulate the Council for its acceptance in Amsterdam of the amendments which make it unambiguously clear that the European Community has a role in the fight against racism."
"I also congratulate the Council on the agreement to establish the European Observatory which, as Commissioner Flynn says, was established eight days ago in Vienna and will be up and running in August this year."
"I welcome very much the appointment of Jean Kahn as the President of the Management Board because of the work he did on the Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia."
"I hope the European Parliament will send its best wishes to Mr Kahn for a swift recovery from the stroke he has suffered."
"We in the Socialist Group have shown a firm commitment behind the Year against Racism."
"In fact we are continuing it - in our case it is a sort of Year and a Bit against Racism."
"On Friday we have a Europe Football and Racism Conference to be held at Old Trafford in Manchester sponsored amongst others by the football team."
"We have a closing conference for the Socialist Group coming up on 2 and 3 March here in Brussels."
"So, our Year against Racism continues."
"We will be supporting the Mohamed Ali report."
"We support the idea that there should be a Code of Conduct."
"We believe that democratic parties in this Parliament should sign it."
"We ask for the Commission, to quote the Commissioner's own words: ' to see the Year against Racism as a foundation and not a monument' ."
"We therefore welcome this year's budget lines for the fight against racism and the proposed action plan."
"More importantly, we believe it is necessary to avoid a hiatus developing between the work already done and that which is to follow."
"As Mrs Quin says, the momentum must not be lost, in particular as the problem continues to get worse with the Front National in its heartlands in southern France stripping the libraries, victimizing the minorities and engaging in chequebook eugenics, as we speak."
"We know it will take some time for Amsterdam to be ratified."
"However, in the meantime we hope the Commission will prepare itself for swift and urgent action."
"What has been indicated today leads us to believe that will be happening."
"The presidency of the Council can serve the people of Europe well by helping to encourage and assist the Commission in this task."
"I thank them all for what we have received but, to paraphrase Oliver Twist , I have to say that we want more!"
"Mr President, I would like to start by warmly congratulating the person who has taken the lead in this yearly debate, Mr Ali, on his dedication."
"I would also like to congratulate the Commissioner and his entire staff, who made so much effort recently to make true progress in the field of anti-racism, and to combat xenophobia and anti-Semitism."
"I am delighted that the Council representative is also here, because we are discussing a policy which is still principally in the hands of the Council."
"The resolution we drafted in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs has been the subject of very intense debate."
"I think at the moment we have come a long way towards reaching a joint opinion."
"A few points are still unresolved, however."
"Mr Ford has already mentioned one with regard to the code of conduct for political parties."
"In fact I am pleased with the way he formulated his own amendments."
"The amendment does not refer to tightening up this Parliament's Rules of Procedure, because everyone, terrible as this may be, should be allowed to express his political opinion; but it refers very expressly to the parties."
"In the future we might have parties which will underwrite this code of conduct and parties which will not."
"We will have politicians who are approachable, you will know where you are, and you will be able to keep people to it."
"I believe that this is one of the most important results of the Year against Racism."
"It has had a very good effect on politicians."
"Politicians, in the Netherlands in particular, have declared that they will not play xenophobic games during the next elections around issues such as refugee policies and so on."
"This is very important, because this kind of thing used to happen in the past."
"I think it is very good that politics is cleaned up in this way."
"I myself have two urgent requests, particularly related to the point which was originally in Mr Ali's motion for a resolution: the reference to the report on ethic cleansing."
"This is, I think, of great significance for us."
"It is a piece of self-criticism on the policy which was made in our own departments of Foreign Affairs."
"I recently read about a new event in this context, namely that, according to the French press, a highly placed French politician had expressed the view that the genocide in Rwanda was less important since it happened in Africa then if it had happened in Europe."
"This is actually a typically racist comment, even though one might not be aware of it."
"That is why it is very important that we still include this point in our resolution, in accordance with the original intentions of Mr Ali."
"I would like to make one remark about the question of the sans papiers ."
"There is a text in the resolution before us which I can only describe as messy."
"In it the NGOs are praised for their commitment to emigrants without documents."
"This is a widely held view."
"In the Netherlands it is the case that, in particular, large numbers of those who turn out to be illegal, or who do not have a convincing refugee story, have mislaid their documents."
"I know of no NGOs which concern themselves with this category, but I do know of NGOs which concern themselves with the special category of emigrants called sans papiers ."
"I have in fact met delegations of sans papiers ."
"This is a special state of affairs in the country in which they are staying."
"I am indeed glad that some NGOs have made efforts on their behalf, because sometimes it is an omission which should be highlighted in legislation."
"In general we cannot say that we, as a legislative body, should be pleased that we can be overruled by a NGO."
"Broadly speaking this cannot be said."
"I have therefore submitted an amendment for the category of sans papiers which I consider to be clearer than the other amendment on the subject."
"I think it is right to talk specifically about this group, and I hope it will be adopted."
"For that matter, I hope that the Council will be willing in the future to subject the issue of racism, xenophobia, and antiSemitism to increased democratic control, so that it does not remain solely in the hands of a Council which responds unanimously, as this provides a weak basis for policy."
"- Madam President, I would like to welcome the Commissioner's proposal to have a follow-up action to the European Year against Racism."
"May I recommend to him that perhaps he looks at the state of racism and xenophobia in my own country."
"Particularly in my own city of Dublin there is an extraordinary manifestation of fear at the gypsies and at the other people coming from Eastern Europe and elsewhere, such as North Africa."
"We have a very small number of refugees coming into the country, compared to Germany or to Britain and other countries."
"Frankly, the Irish people have no reason to be proud about the manner in which we deal with these refugees."
"I want to make that point very clearly."
"I thank the Commissioner for the excellent work he has done in this area."
"He has done a tremendous deal of extraordinarily good work."
"He has made people more and more aware of the need for cultural diversity and the richness of cultural diversity in our country."
"Mr Mohamed Ali, in my view, is one of the most extraordinary people in this Parliament."
"He has been at the forefront of bringing a greater respect and understanding for Islam within the European Union."
"It is of vital importance that we do not equate Islam with the Taliban and other fundamentalists."
"After all, all religious sects and all official religions have their fundamentalists."
"Tolerance of diversity enriches our individual societies."
"Mr Mohamed Ali is to be congratulated for his report which I support in its entirety."
"For the first time in any Treaty agreed at the level of the European Union, the Treaty of Amsterdam expressly lays down the prevention and combatting of racism and xenophobia as an objective of the European Union."
"This is no throwaway objective, it is significant."
"It is clearly a fundamental step forward."
"It is not only important that the European Union and the Member States are committed to providing our citizens with a high level of safety and an area of freedom, security and justice."
"It is important that the commitment is clearly linked to the objective of preventing and combating racism and xenophobia."
"It is an objective which must be backed up by countries' actions."
"History lays bare the terrible truths of racism."
"If we have learned anything it must be that we must use all our powers and strengths to halt racist attacks and abuse."
"The Amsterdam Treaty has many other fine qualities but the inclusion of this objective must be the one to which every citizen can rally around."
"I would like to see the report from Mr Mohamed Ali circulated to all our schools and colleges throughout the European Union because it is there we must tackle, through education, xenophobic and racist attitudes within the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the annual debate on racism must be an opportunity to take some specific steps forward in the fight against racism, xenophobia and all forms of discrimination. Mr Mohamed Ali has tried to make his report such an opportunity, and I congratulate him on his work."
"When that report also refers to the balance-sheet of a European Year against Racism, which 1997 was, it is important to emphasize the significance of the new Treaty of the European Union, which was negotiated and signed in the same year, for that struggle."
"As the rapporteur mentions in point 4, we also regret that, in spite of a few statements of good intentions, non-discrimination has not been incorporated into the Treaty as a fundamental principle of the so-called Community Law with immediate effect."
"As we see in Article 13, ' the necessary measures to combat discrimination on grounds of sex, race and ethnic origin, religion or creed, disablement, age or sexual orientation, on a proposal by the Commission with the unanimous decision of the Council after consulting Parliament' , are fine words and might look like a step forward."
"But that step can also be viewed as a step taken in a minefield, because any number of people have laid booby-traps, and the social situation is an absolute cauldron of racism."
"In addition, the area of freedom, safety and justice which is essential to the fight against racism and xenophobia, as Article 29 makes clear, is not going to be created by fine words and timid actions."
"Time is short, but even so I would not like to finish without underlining the proposal for the establishment of a European Charter of Emigrants' Rights in the context of a policy of integration designed to promote mutual understanding between ethnic groups."
"The title itself is attractive."
"And particularly encouraging for anyone who comes from and lives in a country of emigrants and immigrants."
"This is one of the good proposals in this report which we heartily approve."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Flynn, racism means exclusion."
"The fight against racism is therefore the fight against and the control of exclusion."
"This is something which Commissioner Flynn has always maintained and we fully support him in his stance."
"This means integration rather than forced assimilation, equality of rights rather than legal inequality and equal rights rather than adherence to the misconceived legal division of our society into nationals, EU citizens and non-EU citizens."
"This ranking of people into first, second and third class citizens is the cause of racial violence in the European Union, something which is increasingly becoming the norm and which, in this Year against Racism, is terrifyingly demonstrated in a Eurostat survey which has indicated that 30 % of the citizens of the European Union admit to being racist or antisemitic."
"Democracy is based on participation and on all citizens having an equal share in their society."
"Democratic rights cannot be made contingent upon ethnic origin, skin colour, religion or age."
"Democracy in the European Union is in a bad way when I look at the amount of racism and exclusion which we encounter daily."
"The way in which we deal with minority groups and refuse to accept integration is a disgrace."
"All the solemn declarations made in this Year against Racism are of little use when our policies are achieving just the opposite."
"We have to overcome the problem of legal alienation and raise the legal rights of citizenship throughout the EU to the level of a democratically constituted society."
"This society is to include the new minorities and those who have been invited to join our workforce, for they too are human beings."
"These people are fully entitled to normal human rights."
"The situation is not helped by the fact that our legal and political systems are unwilling to take notice of these minority groups."
"They exist, they are here to stay and they should be allowed to do so."
"Let me close by quoting the words of a rather nice song, which we could possibly take as our slogan: ""My mother is black, my father is white, my sister is yellow, my brothers are red and as for me, I am ten thousand years old and my name is man.'"
"Mr President, the fact that the European Year against Racism is nearly over, should not mean, I think, that the fight against racism is over."
"I saw a copy of the euro barometer opinion polls recently which were submitted at the conclusion of the European Year against Racism, Mr Commissioner, and I have to tell you I find the results disconcerting."
"No less than one third of the interviewees admit to being very or somewhat racist."
"In Belgium that group even comprised over half the interviewees."
"The opinion poll also showed very clearly that xenophobia thrives best on feelings of insecurity, but above all, and this is important, on fear of the future and lack of faith in democratic institutions."
"One conclusion I would like draw from this, colleagues, is that the new study must spur on every democratic party in Europe all the more to continue to create convincing and honest policies and confidence in the institutions which give people faith in the future."
"But there are political parties which have made a real breeding ground out of engendering fear, xenophobia, racism, who abuse their mandates to spew freely their spiteful thoughts on all fronts at once, who speak of 'foreign scum, own people first', and if possible, in all languages at once."
"In Brussels racist pamphlets are pushed though every letter box, including those of Italians and Turkish people, and of people who work in this Parliament, and of colleagues."
"I would like to give Mr Oostlander a message."
"One thing should be clear to us."
"The excuse of political freedom, of freedom of speech should never be used or abused to foster racist objectives or discrimination on the basis of colour or origin, whether inside or outside Parliament."
"Because that is manifestly contrary to human rights."
"A short while ago a reference was made to the charter drafted for political parties in which they commit themselves to combat racism in their own midst, as well as outside it, and in which they vow not to cooperate with groups which incite racist acts."
"I hope that all democratic parties will sign this charter very soon, but also implement it, please."
"But I still believe, Mr Oostlander, that as a democratic institution of the citizens of the European Union, the European Parliament should also incorporate the charter as one of its principles into its own operations."
"It should not be the case that in the name of free speech racist language is uttered in this Chamber."
"It will not wash that the European Parliament gives grants to those who spread xenophobia."
"What has proved possible in the Belgian Parliament and does not appear to be contrary to fundamental freedoms, should, in my view, also be possible in this House."
"I would like to ask the Bureau to make a proposal to the European Parliament with regards to Rules of Procedure or a way of operating whereby we no longer contribute to the hate- stirring messages of some of our colleagues."
"Mr President, the phenomenon of racism and xenophobia currently affecting the entire European Union is a matter of real concern to us all."
"The greater protection from racial, ethnic and religious discrimination afforded by the Amsterdam Treaty is therefore to be welcomed."
"Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that the most effective solution still lies in the power of the mind."
"I think that this is more readily understood when one translates the term ""xenophobia' not by ""animosity towards' or ""hatred of' foreigners, which is a common mistake sadly made all too often nowadays, but more correctly by ""fear of foreigners' ."
"This fear, which is felt mainly by older persons, can only be reduced by each of us acting personally as we go about our daily business."
"Here it is necessary to convey to our citizens a sense of security which enables them to overcome their fear."
"The results of the Year against Racism, which in committee the rapporteur himself has described as the search for an alibi, will not alone be enough to achieve this objective."
"The additional measures announced by the Commissioner will therefore still be needed."
"Mr President, I should like to start off by saying to the last two speakers that they should be a little careful."
"Every one of us is the potential victim of someone else's racist attitudes."
"If we are not prepared to stand up and defend the rights of others, the day may come when our rights are challenged and there will be nobody around to defend them."
"So, be careful."
"I want to congratulate Mr Mohamed Ali on his excellent report and to pick out one or two points."
"Paragraph 6 is very important and I am delighted to say that the new government in Britain will be enacting legislation which will make any criminal activity which is racially motivated a justification for more severe penalties."
"This is absolutely right."
"It is also important that in paragraph 14 we condemn unwise and inflammatory statements, sometimes made by certain politicians who should know better, to provoke racial dislike and racial animosity."
"We have heard comments about communities being swamped and that sort of remark does no good at all."
"People who have influence in society should not incite racial attitudes."
"On paragraph 15 it is important that in the ongoing negotiations for accession of the central and eastern European countries, we make it absolutely clear - and I am not condemning or criticizing any particular country - that respect for human rights and for the whole concept of anti-discrimination contained in Article 13 of the Treaties agreed at Amsterdam is a crucial part of what they will accept when they become members of the European Union."
"The way in which certain minority groups, in particular the travelling communities, have traditionally been treated in some of these countries is shocking and disgraceful and must be brought to an end."
"I support very much the introduction of a code of conduct."
"I hope this will be in operation for the next European elections and will ensure - as happened at the last general election in Britain - that none of the major political parties are tempted to use the race card to their advantage and that those who are not prepared to sign a code of conduct outlawing racial and xenophobic sentiments are marginalized totally."
"Finally, not only must we condemn racism in all its forms but we must extol the positive benefits of a pluralistic multiracial society."
"I am proud to represent such a society in West London, where a third of the community or their parents are of non-English ethnic origin and who by and large live together happily and harmoniously together and positively benefit the community."
"These multi-racial communities are not only culturally enriching but economically stimulating."
"I leave you with this thought."
"The 1.5 million people of Asian origin in Britain last year contributed Â£5 billion through Asian-owned businesses to the economic vitality of my country."
"That is a positive aspect which is too often ignored."
"Mr President, just one year ago, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media organized a public hearing on the theme of, ""Points of convergence between Europe and Islam' , during which one of the guests, Jean Yaya-Michot, Director of the Centre for Arab Philosophy at the Catholic University of Louvain, took pleasure in monopolizing the debate and addressing me in insulting terms of a racist nature."
"Several months later, the same Mr Yaya-Michot published in Beirut a short work justifying, on the basis of theological works, the assassination of the seven monks in Tibehirine."
"I dare to hope that, within the framework of a new Year against Racism, the European Parliament will do its best to spare its Members from verbal aggression by foreign agents, who advocate the extermination, in its most barbarous form, of born and bred Europeans, because they are white and often Christian."
"With regard to Professor Yaya-Michot, we will not have to suffer his insults for much longer, but it will have required my intervention at Vatican level for this recently naturalised Belgian to be made to shut up or to leave my country."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Flynn for his support and for all his endeavours and also to express my particular thanks to all Commission personnel for what they achieved in 1997 as part of the Year against Racism and Xenophobia."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Mohamed Ali on his excellent report."
"Nevertheless, at the end of this year against racism and xenophobia I wish to focus on three aspects which still have to be worked on."
"The first of these is the need to continue with the fight against racism and xenophobia, which commenced in 1997."
"In view of the comments which we have just heard from three Members on the right of the House, it is apparent that we still have a long way to go before Parliament is able to take a different approach to this issue."
"My second point concerns politicians, the media and the scholastic establishment. These groups must become far more aware of their educational role and should be adopting an anti-racist and anti-xenophobic stance."
"Thirdly, the European Union has always been a focus for immigration and emigration, and this is increasingly true today."
"Those migrants who have settled within our boundaries have helped shape our society, and in most cases they have integrated successfully."
"If in recent years this integration has been less successful, that should be blamed not on the migrants themselves but rather on the shortcomings of our political strategy."
"We will have to work much harder to ensure that these new settlers can be better integrated within the boundaries of the Union so that we can build up a real sense of community."
"In this context I have to point out that female migrants are a particularly vulnerable group."
"They suffer from discrimination not only because of their nationality and appearance, but because of their gender."
"The UNHCR has developed strategies for protecting female refugees from human rights violations."
"I therefore call upon Member States to apply the same measures."
"Of special importance to me is a point which we have already discussed in committee and on which we are fundamentally agreed: I consider it to be an error of judgement, and this has been confirmed to us time and time again in various discussions with different organizations, to speak of discrimination on the basis of race."
"As Mrs Roth has also pointed out, there is only one race - the human race."
"There is no such thing as racial difference."
"In order to emphasize this, we ourselves should avoid referring to racial discrimination in any positive context."
"I therefore propose that in future we should reconsider our choice of words and perhaps use a different term - such as harmonization."
"Mr President, let me use my own area of Essex in the UK to demonstrate the success of the European Year."
"In the last 12 months I have personally taken part in a 200-strong business conference on the case for racial equality, a seminar for personnel officers on racial discrimination in employment, a special conference for our county's seven multi-agency racial incident panels and as a judge for an anti-racist poetry competition with entries from over 300 local schoolchildren."
"Yet the number of racially motivated crimes in Essex has remained constant at over 100 this year."
"Research from the community safety department of Essex Police confirms that racist attitudes held in the Community generally help perpetrators to legitimize their racist crimes."
"So I am asking the Commissioner to make sure that he works with us to ensure that every year is the Year against Racism."
"It is why the Essex Race Equality Council will this year start a new anti-racist project with young people in Thurrock, host a national exhibition on racial diversity and this very week convenes a first meeting of local women's groups on questions facing minority ethnic women."
"It is why the Essex Returners Unit with Essex Tech has launched an action plan following on from the Year which includes new recruitment procedures for local police, race awareness for local training organizations and new support for local minority ethnic associations."
"Congratulations to them all."
"For us in the European Parliament, let this one local example serve as an example to us all, and let us remember that Europe's fight against racism needs to reach communities at the local level in Essex and in every part of Europe."
"Unless it does so, it means nothing."
"Mr President, I want very briefly to make one or two remarks in response to the debate."
"I very much welcome the positive tone that the debate has generally adopted and the welcome that has been given to the work of the rapporteur on this particular issue."
"I will briefly pick up on one or two specific points."
"Education was referred to by one or two speakers and I would like to say that the Council fully recognizes the importance of education and work with young people in fostering a society of equality of opportunity."
"As Parliament will know, 21 March has been proclaimed as the day when cultural differences will be celebrated and tolerance promoted among young people and in educational establishments."
"I know that Mr Goerens who spoke earlier has done a great deal to remind young people today of the dangers of Nazism and anti-Semitism of the past."
"I agree with him that remembering the victims of the Holocaust remains very important."
"Both Mr Mohamed Ali and Mr Andrews mentioned specifically the risks of Islamophobia."
"I very much agree with the comments they made."
"It is the responsibility of all of us to reject such unthinking prejudice against any one group."
"So, on behalf of the Council, I would like to say that I have taken careful note of the various points that have been raised during the course of this debate."
"It certainly seems to me that this is clearly an area where the three institutions - Parliament, Commission and Council - can work closely together to promote practical and effective action for the future."
"Thank you, Mrs Quin."
"I confirm that I have received a motion for a resolution, submitted under the terms of Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure ."
"The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m. tomorrow."
"Asylum policy"
"The next item is the group discussion on the following oral questions:"
"B4-1012/97-0-0136/97, put to the Council, and B4-1013/97-0-0137/97, put to the Commission, by Mrs Lindeperg, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on rights of asylum; -B4-1017/97-0-0166/97, put to the Commission by Mr Vinci and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the observance of rights of asylum; -B4-1018/97-0-0174/97, put to the Council, and B4-1019/97-0-0175/97, put to the Commission, by Mr Nassauer and Mr Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, relating to the Dublin Convention on asylum processes; -B4-1020/97-0-0176/97, put to the Council by Mr Schaffner and Mr Caccavale, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe, on asylum policy; -B4-1021/97-0-0178/97, put to the Commission, and B4-1104/97-0-0179/97, put to the Council, by Mr Wiebenger, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on rights of asylum; -B4-0002/98-0-0162/97, put to the Council, and B4-0003/98-0-0163/97, put to the Commission, by Mrs Roth, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the protection of persons suffering persecution from nonState agents; -B4-0004/98-0-0167/97, put to the Council, and B4-0005/98-0-0168/97, put to the Commission, by Mr Pradier, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on justice and internal affairs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me time to speak at such short notice."
"I have asked to be permitted to speak again because I believe that the opportunity must be given to respond to some of the remarks made by the extreme Right in this House."
"If we are debating racism in Europe and the fact that racism in its extreme form is actually spreading in Europe at the present time, and if we then see that in its extreme form...."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Schulz, you requested leave to speak on a point of order."
"The debate you are trying to start up again has already been closed."
"I am unable to re-open it."
"If you are asking for leave to speak on a point of order then you may speak, but not if you want to continue the debate."
"Mr President, thank you for finding me out."
"Nevertheless, I should like to take the opportunity to finish my sentence."
"It is outrageous that those who are claiming for themselves an anti-racism debate are in fact those who represent racism in Europe."
"I would ask you, Mr President, in accordance with Rule 131 of the Rules of Procedure, to defer the present debate on the oral questions submitted by the various Groups, to the next plenary session in Strasbourg to be held on Monday at 5.00 p.m."
"Up to just a few minutes before this debate began, we in the European Socialist Party tried, along with a number of other parliamentary Groups, to agree a compromise text which would as far as possible incorporate the different political positions."
"Five minutes before this plenary sitting began, and for reasons which I do not wish to comment on, the Liberal Group withdrew its signature from that document."
"The result is that there will certainly be no majority in favour of our compromise text tomorrow."
"But neither do we think that any other compromise can be found which would command a majority in this House."
"As a result we are now holding a debate without any hope of a tangible outcome tomorrow."
"But because asylum is such an important issue, we as Social Democrats will continue to search for a broad-based resolution and therefore intend renewing our efforts to reach a compromise with the other Groups."
"For this reason we ask that the debate be deferred as requested."
"Mr Schulz has requested on behalf of the Socialist Group that the debate on the oral questions relating to rights of asylum be deferred."
"May I ask whether anyone is willing to vote in favour or against?"
"Is anyone in favour?"
"Mr President, I would like to comment on the report, just as Mr Schulz just requested."
"Indeed, the problem of asylum is a subject of great importance and the joint resolution, as it came out of the debate yesterday, concerned such a limited point, such a precise point, a point which, furthermore, was part of the Council's programme and therefore not at all controversial, that it would be a shame to make an ideological division out of it."
"Consequently, as Martin Schulz said, I would prefer some time to be given to see how it would be possible to come to an agreement on this subject."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"I oppose the motion to defer this debate."
"Negotiations have taken place on the basis of motions from many individual Groups."
"As far as I know, no Group has insisted that its own text should be taken as the yardstick for all."
"The Group of the European People's Party, for example, had proposed that the Liberals' motion for resolution be taken as a basis for negotiation."
"This was rejected."
"The outcome of the negotiations is that from the outset we, in the European People's Party did not sign the motion for resolution."
"The resolution proposed by the Liberals and also that proposed by the PPE are at least still available for voting on."
"We therefore see no reason, even though the Socialist Group believes that there will not be a majority for their proposal, to delete an item from the agenda and to refer it back to committee."
"We want to see the agenda worked through in its original form."
"Mr Nassauer, the motion is that this debate be deferred, leaving it to the discretion of the Conference of Presidents to fix a date for it."
"(Parliament agreed to the request that the debate be deferred) The debate is therefore deferred to a date to be notified by the Presidents' Conference."
"Mr President, I will be voting against."
"I am against deferment, because the reasons given by those who are calling for it do not hold up in any way."
"These are various manoeuvres unrelated to the need for urgent debate of the issue and for there to be yet another decision by the European Parliament to create as much pressure as possible against extending the conditions and prerequisites for the granting of asylum."
"Mr President, I have a question. When the bell goes, how long do we have to get to the Hemicycle?"
"Because we ran out of the office, leaving people in mid-sentence, but we still did not get here in time."
"Could you please tell us how much time we have, so we know whether to gallop, trot or walk?"
"Mrs DÃ­ez de Rivera, according to the Rules of this House I can only have the bells rung when I become aware that the rule for the tabling of a motion has been invoked."
"Until then I am unable to do so."
"And the time available is the interval between the time of making the announcement and the time at which I have to put the motion to the vote, after inviting Members to speak for or against it."
"A procedural vote of this type can take place at any time."
"Application of Community law - CELEX"
"The next item is Report A4-0008/98, by Mrs Thors, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Matters and Citizens' Rights, relating to the fourteenth Annual Report of the Commission on the monitoring of Community Law application (1996) and the working document on the Commission's CELEX 1996 services (relating to the interinstitutional computerised documentation system on Community Law); 1996 Management Report (COM(97)0299 - C4-0312/97 - SEC(97)1082 - C4-0313/97)."
"Mr President, every one of our Parliament's rapporteurs who examines the European Commission's annual report on the application of Community Law aspires to display his own method and attitude."
"The same has happened this year with our esteemed colleague Mrs Astrid Thors."
"And I will not disagree with her, because there is perhaps nothing worse, both for the European Parliament's image and in substance, than a boring restatement for the umpteenth time of views expressed many times before in this Chamber."
"In that respect the rapporteur chose not to deal with the great and more general problems which influence the interpretation and application of Community Law, but to concentrate her attention more on more practical matters which perhaps have a more direct bearing on Europe's citizens."
"So she highlighted two basic elements: greater participation by Europe's citizens themselves in the application of Community Law, and the European Ombudsman's interventions, which tend towards the same direction."
"And Mrs Thors has formulated practical proposals to deal with several problems, with which - naturally - I think most of us can agree."
"The European People's Party will therefore vote in favour of her report, which also comprises three amendments that I had the honour to table and which the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights was kind enough to accept."
"I think it might be necessary for me to comment, in order to reinforce those views, on just two or three subjects: it is indicative that out of 1 076 cases initiated by the Commission in 1996, 819 were set in motion following complaints by European citizens."
"And it is just as characteristic that 36 % of the complaints made to the European Ombudsman concerning infringements of Community Law again came from European citizens."
"There are several other positive elements, Mr President, during the period we are considering."
"I will point indicatively to the fact that the Commission initiated many more cases, to the possibility of access to Community Law via the Internet and the institution of more proceedings, and if you will, to the establishment of the possibility of imposing financial penalties upon Member States which fail to implement the decisions of the European Court of Justice."
"On the other hand, however, we must note that, as I fear, the major problems persist and little progress has been made with them."
"The process of seeking justice is always very lengthy, time-consuming and very costly."
"The teaching of Community Law has not yet even become established in the law schools of the top Educational Institutions in the 15 Member States."
"There are still problems with the tendency of certain constitutional courts to wish to dispute with the Court of the European Communities the jurisdiction of annulment for Community regulatory acts without entitlement to any such jurisdiction, a trend which began in the German Supreme Constitutional Court, and one which, for all we know, may be imitated by the Danish Supreme Court which is due to pronounce in a few weeks."
"So there are both positive and negative elements."
"A much greater effort must be made, and I believe that the report by Mrs Thors will assist that effort."
"Madam Rapporteur, Mr President, it seems to be a hobby of some of our colleagues to pillory the Member States, who are the cause, according to them, of all the evils which affect the European Union."
"Thus, Mrs Thors' report highlights that the average rate of notification - and I quote - ""for transposition measures taken by the Member States as a whole is 92.8 %' ."
"This is truly what legislators dream of and in particular, French legislators who, far too often vote in laws and then wait months, even years, for the regulatory rules to enable them to implement them."
"So rather than always complaining about Member States, I personally prefer to commend the zeal with which Community law is being implemented."
"The rapporteur also highlights the difficulties of the practical and concrete application of community law and the lack of knowledge of the law on the part of our citizens."
"This is a question of training, of legal training and of university training."
"This obviously is the role of the Member States and not the European Union which, in this area, can only limit itself to giving encouragement."
"Finally, the rapporteur highlighted the delicate question of the powers exercised by Member States' Constitutional Courts on the validity of prescriptive acts in relation to constitutions."
"This is a particularly serious question, basic laws being, in a way, the founding basis of the social and political contract of the Member States."
"And the French Constitutional Court, by demanding the amendment of our constitution when the measures of draft treaties do not conform to it, indicates that, on the contrary, the Supreme Court recognises the impossibility of applying a European standard which is contrary to our constitution."
"This seems to me indeed normal and desirable, our constitutions being the supreme act of our sovereignty."
"Mr President, it seems that we do not have ""the same procedure as last year' , to coin a phrase."
"The rapporteur has done very well and for that I offer her my sincere thanks."
"The motion for resolution includes an early mention of the national constitutional courts."
"I would like - and I hope that I am proceeding along the same lines as you here - to say something about the Federal Constitutional Court, which has a constitutional appeal pending in respect of the euro."
"The Federal Constitutional Court must know what it is doing."
"It may be plunging the European Union into a deep political crisis from which the EU may never recover."
"But it must know what it is doing."
"Let me just single out one of the many practical examples mentioned by the rapporteur, namely the control procedure and the role of the citizen."
"I wholeheartedly support the initiative of the citizens' representative and of the rapporteur that, should this control procedure result in a negative decision by the Commission, then this decision must be substantiated."
"This has something to do with democracy."
"I have followed the midday debate on whether Commissioners or officials are now politicians, civil servants or whatever, with a certain amusement."
"From the outside the situation looks somewhat different."
"Allow me to quote from a recent edition of the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung , which states: ""It is certainly true that without the expert knowledge and diligence of the civil servants in Brussels a century project like the euro would never materialize, because it would be talked to death for years."
"It is not true that one of these civil servants will have to take some sort of responsibility if the experiment fails."
"One obviously hopes that they have the sense of responsibility which Max Weber demands from politicians, but they are not responsible for their work, they just have to carry it out.'"
"The western inventors of democracy certainly did not conceive it thus."
"It matters that we should establish this public openness between the Commission and its citizens, and for that reason I am particularly thankful for this part of the report."
"While I am talking about the basics, let me quote from a very old text which, though penned more than 200 years ago, is still relevant today."
"It was written in 1795 by Imanuel Kant on the subject of eternal peace and goes as follows: ""All deeds which relate to the rights of other men, and whose maxim is not compatible with publicity, are wrongful.'"
"This maxim, Kant goes on to say, is one which I may not divulge without at the same time thwarting my own intention, which itself must be kept absolutely secret if it is to succeed and to which I cannot publicly admit, without provoking inevitable opposition from everyone to my design; such a maxim can only have its origins in injustice and therefore constitutes a threat to us all."
"My appeal to the Commission is therefore as follows: Please take this matter very seriously."
"Something which is not founded on injustice can be made public, can be made accessible to public discussion, can be opened up to public debate."
"This establishes trust rather than secrecy."
"Mr President, I am grateful to Madam Torres for bringing forward this extremely good report."
"The conclusions reached in the Social Affairs Committee were developed as an insight into the citizens' interface with the institutions and the methodology with which we bring about this application of law across the European Union, particularly in the social arena."
"We listed many faults."
"The conclusions from the Committee dealt with, for example, equal opportunities and the use of structural funds and the inadequate addressing of this point; the free movement of people; the testing of collectively-agreed directives separately and differently from Community law in general; the judicial and legal customs of Members States around the European Union."
"We should not just test the letter of the law but the effect of the law as well."
"The implication that so much law can apply in such a non-uniform way, should prompt the Commission to respond urgently to the issues Madam Torres accepts."
"She accepts only some of the issues raised in the Social Affairs Committee and I regret this."
"Particularly the technical/legal customs and traditions which exist in all countries across the European Union should be considered in terms of their effect and not just their letter."
"Settlement finality"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0005/98) by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the common position established by the Council (C4-0534/97-96/0126(COD)) with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur has already stated, we in the Christian Democrat and Social Democrat Groups have agreed a common position in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"We support this position."
"The rapporteur has done an excellent job."
"The fact that we have not restricted the proposal to payment systems alone, but have managed to include securities and settlement systems, is a real achievement."
"This was a very important point."
"What I also consider to be of great significance is the principle that all creditors be treated equally in the event of insolvency."
"Here we have now created a substantial legal framework against a background of maximum publicity and we have done this within the scope of that which can be politically achieved at the present time."
"This is all down to Mr Lehne and for this I wish to express to him my heartfelt thanks."
"We shall be supporting this common position here in Parliament."
"Mr President, I would like to add my congratulations to the paeans of praise that have been heaped on the rapporteur for his wisdom, and particularly to speak in support of his Amendment No 5 which has been co-signed by Mr Rothley on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"That amendment goes to the heart of what is a very important problem in this proposal."
"This proposal, incidentally, is a major part of the single market programme."
"It concerns the dangers of what might happen if a bank, for example, were to be declared bankrupt at the beginning of a payment transaction and the message about that bankruptcy were not transmitted to the rest of Europe until too late."
"Amendment No 5 anticipates the difficulties that might arise under that situation, though, as has been pointed out by other speakers, it shifts the burden of proof."
"I would just add in parenthesis here that the drafting of the original directive was perhaps not as good as it might have been."
"I am not sure that the common position as it has emerged from the Council is necessarily perfect but I hope that we will be taking one step further towards an improved text when we vote tomorrow."
"I would support what the rapporteur said in suggesting that the Parliament should accept all of the amendments which have been proposed by my group and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, particularly in the all-important Amendment No 5 which relates to Article 3(1).The whole purpose, of course, is to ensure that the settlement systems operate properly within a single market."
"But it is also to make sure that there is an adequate settlement system without too much risk of people being deprived of their due payments under the European Monetary Union settlement system."
"This is an important measure from every point of view and to that extent we should, perhaps, congratulate both the Commission and the rapporteur and hopefully the Council - though sadly the British presidency is not present this evening - because this is a very important issue for Europe's principal financial centre which is, of course, London."
"Mr President, the proposal for a directive concerning settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems is born out of the incontestable fact that a few cases where large banks have been declared bankrupt have severely tested the financial system, both at national and international level."
"The aim of the Commission's proposal is to establish a privilege for institutions that are party to multilateral agreements on netting, collateral security or credit guarantee systems, thereby making all the creditors in the multilateral circuit immune from any insolvency proceedings opened against one of the signatory institutions."
"To summarize, the intention is to remove the financial system from the principle of par in par creditorum and give it an advantage over all other creditors in the event of its involvement in insolvency proceedings against banks or other financial institutions."
"In fact, a payment made by a credit institution to any third party would continue to be revoked if the credit institution went bankrupt under the common rules currently in force in individual Member States. However, this payment would no longer be subject to revocation if another credit institution benefited from it, even if this happened the day before the insolvency proceedings were opened and, under certain conditions, even if it happened on the actual day that the proceedings were opened."
"The reasoning behind this preferential treatment, it is maintained, stems from the need to introduce safeguards within a system which, although subject to few controls, manages enormous amounts of capital obtained, as we know, from millions of savers."
"Although these considerations are no doubt worthy of attention, the consequences of the new directive must, nonetheless, be properly evaluated."
"Are we sure, for example, that it will not have negative repercussions on the fabric of small and medium-sized enterprises which, as everyone knows, form the backbone of the European economy? They are also the only means of creating new jobs but will obviously be excluded from this system which we can certainly describe as privileged."
"As always, our debate is taking place amid the indifference of public opinion which is not informed, until it is too late, of what is being planned in this Chamber."
"Perhaps the glare of public opinion would force us to be more cautious."
"To conclude my brief speech, while fully appreciating the hard work done both by the Commissioner, Mr Monti, and the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, I feel I must emphasize that creating an insolvency-proof financial zone may also be risky and increase the gulf that separates the Europe of Institutions from the Europe of citizens, all the more so as, at the present time, the Union is not yet engaged in harmonizing bankruptcy law as a whole, despite repeated requests from the European Parliament in many of its resolutions."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his usual, very thoughtful work."
"The object of this proposal is to protect the banking settlement systems from the insolvency of the participants."
"The reasoning behind this proposal is to prevent creditors from claiming payments already made into the banking system when the insolvency of a bank is opened."
"If this were not the case the banking system would suffer from a lack of certainty."
"Creditors will still be able to claim against an insolvent bank but without undermining the banking system of payments."
"The main issue of concern is at which time should the insolvency proceedings be deemed to have started."
"In my view, payments made in good faith on the day of insolvency proceedings being opened should still be protected."
"Although the number of time zones in the European Union is fairly limited compared with, say, the United States, nevertheless there is some divergency and certainty is essential in insolvency proceedings."
"Consequently, I note Article 3 of the proposal and support compromise Amendment No 5 which, although not perfect, is a reasonably fair reflection of the situation."
"Again, although this may seem, as I have said many times in this Chamber before, a rather arid and academic subject, it adds to the protection of consumers and banking laws and systems in general."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights for their valuable contribution to the consideration of this proposal."
"Although, as a member of the Commission, I cannot agree with what has been written in Mr Lehne's report to the Committee on Legal Affairs, I do understand the legitimate concerns that lie behind it."
"It is precisely for this reason that I would like to express my appreciation to Mr Lehne and Mr Rothley for introducing new amendments for this part-session to replace the previous ones, which the Commission welcomes wholeheartedly because they help to clarify and improve the proposal."
"This proposal will fill a gap in the legislation relating to the single market as it provides legal certainty with regard to cross-border and domestic payment and securities settlement systems."
"Until now the uncertainty concerning the legal framework to be applied in the event of insolvency has inhibited the development of these systems."
"This was deplorable, considering that the efficiency of cross-border transactions has increased substantially since these systems have been in place."
"It is also legitimate to expect a reduction in the cost of business transacted through them."
"Studies carried out by the Commission have shown that, because of the inefficiency associated with cross-border transactions, the charges for low-value transfers - which are, after all, what interests our citizens the most - may amount to as much as 25 % of the sum transferred."
"Another important aim of this directive is to provide a legal basis for establishing collateral security with the central banks of other Member States, a practice which will become even more important with the introduction of the single currency."
"Finally, this directive will be an essential back-up instrument - it is on record - for the target, the vehicle through which the European Central Bank will create the common monetary policy."
"New Amendment No 5 balances two interests: on the one hand there is the interest in protecting the payment and securities settlement systems and avoiding major crises in the financial markets, and in this respect South-East Asia clearly illustrates the effects of such crises, not only on national economic systems but also worldwide; on the other hand, there is the need to respect the principle of par in par creditorum in bankruptcy law."
"This amendment represents a fine balance between the two interests."
"Paragraph 2 of Amendment No 6 clarifies what was previously stated in more ambiguous terms in Article 11 of the common position."
"The Commission can therefore agree to the deletion of Article 11 and its substitution by this paragraph."
"The fact that Member States can impose a duty of supervision on systems may not under any circumstances prejudice the powers conferred on the European Central Bank pursuant to Article 22 of its charter."
"In this regard, bearing in mind all that has been said, I would like to recommend the following wording be added to paragraph 3 of Article 10: ""in addition to the duty of notification under the first paragraph and without prejudice to Article 22 of the charter of the European central banking system of and the European central bank or the areas of competence of the European central bank, the Member States may subject to supervision or request approval for systems which enter within the respective jurisdictions' ."
"Finally, the Commission is prepared to accept the greater degree of transparency with regard to the sender of a payment or a transaction concerning securities, which has been introduced in the third paragraph of Amendment No 2."
"In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that, thanks to the fruitful dialogue between our Institutions, the Commission is able to accept the two new amendments."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Connected telecommunications - Mobile and wireless communications"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0023/98 by Mrs Read, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on connected telecommunications equipment and the mutual recognition of the conformity of equipment (COM(97)0257 - C4-0275/97-97/0149(COD)); -A4-0027/98 by Mr CamisÃ³n Asensio, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the further development of mobile and wireless communications - Challenges and choices for the European Union (COM(97)0217 - C4-0271/97)."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal concerning connected terminal equipment first came to this Parliament in 1990 and was based on a proposal from the Commission about mutual recognition of type approval for terminal equipment."
"That approach was based very much on the test house system and mutual recognition in every country in the Union of acceptable testing."
"For a variety of reasons which are articulated very clearly in the Commission document, the Commission feels it appropriate for a new proposal and a different approach, based on manufacturers' self-testing and a unilateral declaration of conformity."
"Broadly, I and the Economic and Monetary Committee voted in favour of this approach."
"The proposal contains measures about the definition of equipment and essential requirements and about the procedure for ensuring compliance."
"One matter which has exercised me, as the rapporteur and other colleagues on the Committee, is the whole question of the ability of terminal equipment either to damage the network or to damage the users."
"I listened very carefully to the representations to me about how likely this was and how great a danger it presented."
"If it presents a danger - and I was convinced that to some extent it does - then it is right to allow the possibility of the withdrawal of those products from the market or temporary disconnection."
"I have submitted some compromise amendments which I hope are going to meet with the approval of other groups in this House which have addressed this issue but suggested that any remedy should be proportionate to the chance of any damage, either to the network, I emphasize, or to the users."
"I spent some time too looking at the rights of disabled consumers who traditionally have gained employment in this field of the telecommunications industry."
"It was interesting that the Amsterdam Treaty, drawn up at the time we were considering this proposal, makes its own statement on which I draw. I think it is worth quoting from it."
"It is a declaration regarding persons with a disability and it reads: ' the conference agrees that in drawing up measures under Article 100a of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Institutions of the Community shall take account of the needs of persons with a disability.'"
"For that reason, part of my report and my suggestions cover this very matter."
"It is right to stress that we support the Commission approach; we know that there has been a revised Presidency text taking into account many of the constructive points put forward by the many lobbyists and I have tried to take those into account when drawing up my own proposals, even though we were procedurally working with the Commission's original text."
"I commend my compromise amendments to you and I very much hope that we can have a constructive and thoughtful first reading."
"Before I continue, I would like to make an announcement, and I hope that everyone who is going to participate in this evening's debate or is intending to listen to it, can hear what I am now saying."
"As you know, it was the intention to have a break at 8.00 p.m., but because we only have around 1 Â½ hours of debate left, I propose that we continue the debate until 8.30 p.m. and then close for the day."
"I am pleased that Mr Herman and others look happy."
"I therefore consider it accepted."
"Mr President, the Commission has brilliantly conveyed the vital issues in relation to mobile communications and new developments in cordless communications."
"The intention is to develop more efficient mobile communications systems to meet users' needs."
"The explosive development in telecommunications has been changing our world at a very fast pace."
"Things go at enormous speed and do not hang around waiting for the slow decision-process to take effect in Europe."
"What we now need from the Commission is a clearer plan for the third generation UMTS system, and involvement in the international promotion of European views."
"The Commission has to stress its special role as emboldener and researcher."
"The continued tale of success of the European GSM, and the growth of markets require a strong policy of support."
"The outlook for mobile communications is promising."
"Markets are growing and, at the same pace, industry's expectations for sales of cordless and fixed multimedia applications are growing also."
"International competition for customers is fierce, however."
"The keen Asian markets are growing fast, in spite of the crisis."
"There are great demands now being made by consumers."
"They want to combine mobility, telecommunications and multimedia."
"It is vital to see how European and Asian user needs and spheres of development in markets differ from each other."
"Unless these needs are understood in good time, Europe might lose its influence and no longer be an important player in this important area of industry."
"Computer technology and the communications industry are important for the whole European economy, because they are a meaningful and ever-growing part of industrial activity and because they offer the possibility of more jobs."
"Strong domestic markets have given European industry, as far as GSM is concerned, the best conditions for competition in the world market."
"This competitiveness in products and services coming out of the production process must be preserved, because it forms the basis of the developing information society."
"The social dimension must be brought in here, with the assurance that the sparsely populated regions can also have a share in this future supply of services."
"There have been bad experiences from the so-called frequency auctions in the United States."
"With them the price can get so high that it clearly affects the operator's ability to get sufficient coverage and provide a decent service."
"This would distort competition and hamper the chances of new, innovative, small-sized companies getting into the market."
"Mr President, firstly a few words about Mrs Read's report."
"It says that there is a need to ease the advent of new telecommunications equipment onto the market."
"Since 1991 there has been a principle of mutual recognition where the authorities in one Member State do not need to approve equipment for the market if one other country has already done so."
"Now they intend to ease the process still further."
"The Greens think this is risky."
"We agree with Mrs Read that in the future we should try to work in harmony, in order to ensure that safe and userfriendly goods will come into the market."
"We must take care that the work environment is not so confusing and complex as to encourage a growing variety of telecommunications systems, which are not at all compatible for the user."
"We especially support Mrs Read in the concern she has expressed in many of her amendments."
"Also linked with this is the need in future to demand that this new technology will present no problems for the disabled."
"Here there is a very great danger of inequality arising out of the prospect of new telecommunications equipment making it difficult for disabled people to work."
"I believe the Commission has to address this matter much more seriously."
"Finally, the most outstanding thought we had on Mr CamisÃ³n's report on cordless communications and mobile phones was that the Commission should give strong support to how this kind of electronic smog might affect our health."
"This is an important point when we consider how more and more new wavelengths are being split up."
"Mr President, I am grateful for an opportunity to add my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr CamisÃ³n, on his report."
"My group is delighted to support it."
"I briefly want to draw attention to just a couple of points."
"One is that his work is very much about the future, albeit the immediate future as his explanatory statement rightly stresses."
"He says in his report that 'the concept of third generation mobile communications is not yet fully developed but the problem is only one of time and progress seems unstoppable' ."
"Later in his report he and Mr Lindqvist both stress the importance of the competitiveness of this sector and its importance in making sure that we have a viable, competitive European industry to compete against Japan and the United States of America."
"His report also talks about the importance of market forces and the balance between that and regulation."
"The consumer is less and less interested in the means of making a telephone call or using other telecommunications services."
"What they want is to do it cheaply, effectively and efficiently and this is an important part of this equation."
"I congratulate Mr CamisÃ³n."
"Thank you, Mr Bangemann."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Open network provision (ONP) to voice telephony"
"The next item is report (A4-0013/98) by Mrs Read, on behalf of the European Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the application of open network provision (ONP) to voice telephony and on universal service for telecommunications in a competitive environment (amendment of European Parliament and Council Directive 95/62/EC) (C4-0003/98-96/0226(COD))."
"Mr President, I have great pleasure in recommending that the plenary approve the joint text that has gone through the conciliation process."
"If I could remind you - and I am sure Commissioner Bangemann and his officials will need no reminding - this is the third attempt we have jointly made to get this proposal right."
"It is somewhat ironic, in particular in view of Mr CamisÃ³n's report that it is almost in danger - as I am sure the Commissioner will say - of being overtaken by technology."
"Certainly many long-distance calls are now made via the Internet rather than traditional telephony methods."
"Nevertheless, one of the reasons Parliament rightly placed great emphasis on consumer protection in connection with this report is because this is the basic voice telephone service that most of us use in making our day-to-day telephone calls."
"We tried very much to have the needs of the ordinary domestic consumer, the small business, in mind when we were conducting our deliberations."
"I want to place on record my own thanks to the Commission officials who had endless patience in the many meetings we had on this, Parliament officials in the conciliation service and, of course, the presidency."
"We were able to get a conclusion, not absolutely what we wanted but sufficiently meritorious to command the support of this Parliament on the concept of affordable price. On the question of the cost of universal service, about consumer protection and service quality, about the protection of disabled users..."
"I apologise for my cough. Whisky would be better than water!... about the protection of disabled users and again we use the new clause in the Amsterdam Treaty, about number portability although we recognized that this is also much more appropriate in what stems from the Green Paper and with regard to network access."
"It is the best outcome and one that merits the support of this House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after what Mrs Read has just said, there is not much to add."
"I too would like to congratulate the Commission and the Presidency of the Council for having had the patience to negotiate inch by inch with Parliament in order to achieve something which was acceptable to the industry, the companies and the consumers."
"I believe that the compromise obtained is a good one."
"It was due time to reach it, because the deadline had been passed."
"Everything should have been ready on 1 January this year."
"We are a few weeks late, but I do not think that is irreparable."
"The most important thing is to continue along this line, in this direction, and I am pleased that Parliament, I think I am now able to say this, will be supporting the conclusions of the Conciliation Committee virtually unanimously."
"Mr President, first of all, I hope Mrs Read's health has improved a little."
"I do not think that a whiskey would be a good idea in this House."
"We should not drink whiskey, Mr President, so that we can have sober debates."
"Firstly, I would like to congratulate Mrs Read on this report and on her efforts to come to a common rule in this field of universal service."
"I think that on this point we have had a very important struggle to formulate concepts such as affordable prices and the cost of public services and so on, and to arrive at a common position with the Council and the Commission."
"It was worth it in every respect."
"What is also very important on behalf of my group, I think, is that we included the notion that Member States may make additional demands, but that they are not allowed to transfer this to the operators."
"Because I think this gives telecommunications another opportunity to develop further in a sound way."
"I think that the charging principles which we have adopted are good."
"It is a pity, therefore, that as soon as than number portability became a reality, and people were having the opportunity to change operators, Deutsche Telekom immediately set itself up to give the customer a penalty discount."
"I am therefore glad the Commission immediately responded."
"But it does indicate that we will have to be alert when discussing the subject of number portability and carry preselection in this House during a second reading."
"I would like to speak up once again about public emergency services."
"I know that the Commission is looking at this at the moment."
"We have the emergency number 112, but in a number of Member States such as Spain and Greece the number does not work."
"In Belgium the police are still driving around with a reference to the old emergency number, and in a number of Member States telephone operators only speak their own language to the great frustration of foreign tourists who are stranded."
"I would really like to ask the Commission and the Commissioner to breathe new life into the emergency number 112."
"I am glad that on the issue of the disabled we have reached an effective agreement and compromise."
"I believe this means that the European citizen has a decent piece of legislation."
"It is obviously evolutionary legislation."
"During the review in the coming years we will have to come back to this."
"Mr President, what I have to say will not take long."
"Mrs Read deserves our applause."
"She has achieved an excellent result for Parliament and indeed for consumers everywhere."
"Concerted action of this kind does not always necessarily produce a satisfactory result."
"Sometimes one simply has to accept something because one can do nothing else, but in this case Parliament's amendments represented an improvement on the original proposal and most of these ultimately prevailed."
"As to the question which Mr Herman raised yet again, namely whether in this situation one should be satisfied with these provisions and even with the date, it is naturally true that with Parliament's final decision we have lagged a bit behind the 1 January deadline."
"Last week we had some time off."
"We are now making up for this."
"Last week we heaped praise on Mrs Read and other Members of this Parliament, and this may to some degree compensate for this loss of time."
"From a practical point of view there is nothing wrong in this, Mr van Velzen."
"Even the Deutsche Telekom decision, which you have again referred to, must first be approved by the national regulation committee."
"That body is responsible for looking into such matters, and in this respect the customer can rely on the fact that such decisions will not be made over his head by the so-called operators, but will actually be properly examined."
"As regards the other point which you raised, namely the emergency number, there is in fact no legal problem because the Member States have accepted this position from a legal point of view."
"There are practical problems with the conversion, but we will be discussing this at the next telecom meeting so that progress can be made here."
"Let me express my overall thanks to Mrs Read."
"If it were not considered a bit risky nowadays, I would say that we were moving towards a love affair, because one could not have wished for a more agreeable or more sincere partnership."
"I therefore extend to the rapporteur my warmest thanks."
"And I hope that my colleague Mrs Bjerregaard is not too jealous."
"(Mrs Bjerregaard: But I am, Martin)"
"Socrates"
"The next item is report (A4-0012/98) by Mrs Pack, on behalf of the European Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council Decision amending Decision No 819/95/EC establishing the Community action programme Socrates (C4-0002/98-97/0103 (COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is of course a good thing that the Conciliation Committee succeeded in obtaining a modest increase in funding for the Socrates programme, though as Mrs Pack quite rightly says, this is not in fact a real increase."
"Nevertheless, we must accept the result."
"Unfortunately I fear that this decision indicates that there has been no improvement in the European Finance Ministers' basic understanding of the enormous significance of the European youth exchange scheme for European policy, integration and employment."
"If the European Community is only prepared to provide for youth policy actions no more than 1/270th of the amount which it allocates to agriculture policy, then this is simply disgraceful."
"As we prepare for the entry of central and eastern European nations we now need more than ever a greater exchange of people and ideas in the field of education and a greater interchange with the young people of those countries, in order to overcome the historical alienation which exists between the different European peoples."
"But I would also advise all politicians with an interest in employment affairs, who quite rightly deplore the scandalously high level of youth unemployment, to take a very close look at the correlation which exists between the increased availability of work experience in other countries and the new employment opportunities for young people in the European job market."
"More and more employers are including overseas work experience and knowledge of a foreign language as essential job qualifications, and let us not forget the importance of cooperation between schools and colleges in Europe for the introduction of innovative teaching and education methods and for the overall level of qualification being achieved."
"There is no doubt that EU education programmes such as Socrates have proved an overall success."
"The Socrates programme is a first-class way of promoting integration and, in conjunction with the Erasmus programme, for example, it has certainly promoted the concept of Europe among the young people of the Union."
"But the scheme is only open to a few, because it is hopelessly underfunded, and this has had fatal consequences."
"Study grants are underfinanced and even here we see social selection taking place."
"The average grant is between ECU 50 and 100."
"Such a situation is socially incompatible and tends to undermine the impact of the programmes."
"We have all heard the complaints of our own constituents and we know of many applicants who have missed out here."
"The critical funding situation is even beginning to threaten the popularity of the programmes themselves."
"In view of the allocation ratio of 1 to 10 in the case of Erasmus, some colleges and even a number of vice-chancellors' conferences have considered withdrawing from the programme."
"We all want to see study periods spent in other EU countries recognised once the student returns to his country of residence."
"We therefore need more money to support schemes such as the European Course Credit Transfer."
"And we also want to see more students being provided with grant assistance for foreign trips, provided that these are being organised for practical purposes."
"I believe that we should fight for a substantial increase in this programme budget."
"Mr President, the enlargement of the European Union is important for the whole of Europe and for all Europeans."
"What is more important is that this process be undertaken in an orderly fashion."
"The membership negotiations which are to commence shortly will seek to achieve this objective."
"But the so-called pre-membership strategy also serves to achieve these ends."
"Within this strategy one fact which has particular weight is that we quite consciously wish to include the central and eastern European states in one of the most successful Community programmes which we have launched in recent years."
"Erasmus is a programme which, in place of neurosis and xenophobia, seeks to establish a Europe-wide network of young people as part of their education process."
"These young people have intercultural experience, a knowledge of foreign languages, which is expanding, and are undergoing an expansion and transfer of know-how, from which we shall all profit."
"I know this personally as a trustee of one of the Erasmus programmes which brings together law students in 15 Member States, and one hopes that in future this will also include the countries of central and eastern Europe - and the legal fraternity is notoriously difficult to bring together because of the alleged and actual disparity which exists between our various legal systems."
"This year for the first time we resolved to extend the Erasmus programme beyond the existing framework."
"The Council and the Commission then got out their red pencils."
"Criticism has already quite rightly been expressed that, had this House not insisted on its rights of conciliation, then a good idea, and a necessary one for a larger unified Europe, would have seen its progress checked in a way which would have not really been enforceable."
"As a university lecturer, I wish to thank all those involved for supporting this initiative."
"Good things obviously take time, but this should not be taken to extremes."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate all those involved in conciliation and achieving more for the Socrates Programme than some of us even dreamed was possible."
"It is one of the best, most important and most popular of European initiatives."
"A recent article in one of the British magazines said that most EU citizens could not even tell you what the EU is for and the British disease of Euroscepticism was creeping across Europe."
"There is no better way to counter scepticism than to provide education."
"Education and opportunities to learn about other countries, other cultures and other people; to learn about the joint history of Europe and to build on what unites us and not what divides us."
"Mrs Pack spoke about a Europe of the citizens and this is what Socrates works to provide."
"It can be the key to countering the Euroscepticism to which I referred."
"With the expansion of Europe, as Mr Rack described a few moments ago, the Socrates programme is more important than ever."
"In talking about enlargement of the European Union, it is important in providing exchanges - exchanges of people, yes, but exchanges of ideas and information too."
"Countries that are developing and recovering from repressive regimes need extra funding and there are wide differences in the amount of funding available for education."
"By coincidence, there is a study being launched today by the National Union of Teachers of England and Wales and the Educational Institute of Scotland which talks about comparisons in education funding across Europe."
"In this Chamber we all know about the importance of education and the importance of realistic levels of funding to give young people chances in life and equalities of opportunity."
"Somebody said that the trouble with education funding is that it is a bottomless bucket."
"It is true that we could always spend more."
"Mr Elchlepp spoke about the amount of money the European Union spends on agriculture and the amount that is wasted on the common agricultural policy and abuses in that system."
"There are millions of pounds of European money going in fraud."
"New Parliament buildings are going up across Europe."
"Shortly we will have four hemicycles."
"We have fancy offices which most Members did not want and cannot justify."
"These - rather than providing education for the young people - are strange priorities for Europe to have."
"Education and learning about Europe is a priority and needs funding."
"The Socrates funding, as others have said, is always well spent."
"Mr Elchlepp said that it is heavily over-subscribed in Germany as it is in other countries."
"It is a success and money well spent."
"We must address our priorities and this report is going very much in the right direction."
"I support it as does my group."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Pack for the splendid work she has done for the programme, especially in her defence of Parliament's view on the Conciliation Committee."
"The ECU 70 million addition to the Socrates programme is a positive move."
"We must nevertheless remember that even with this additional financing the resources planned for the programme will not be sufficient to do all we need to do."
"Article 126 of the Treaty on European Union defines community goals in education and policy on youth."
"In the spirit of the treaty let us strive to bring the European dimension to the question of education."
"The goal is an extremely clear one and one that is important in structuring a real Europe of citizens."
"Unfortunately, not everyone has internalized this as yet."
"Each Community-spent mark, franc or crown which helps our citizens to become more mobile in a concrete way, makes the Union seem more real and meaningful in the eyes of our people."
"If students and researchers are made more mobile this should be the key project for both close-knittedness in the Union and future enlargement."
"It is vital that Socrates money be increased significantly in the near future."
"It is a crying shame that some of the exchange programme places have not been filled just because the Erasmus project was so meagre in its funding and so young people have not been given the opportunity to study abroad."
"I know of examples from Finland where the Erasmus student grant was 2 000 marks, or around 15 000 Belgian francs a year."
"The sum is ridiculous, and is forcing many students to fund their overseas education with loans."
"Is this the European dimension in educational development?"
"The Union must try to see that everyone wishing to go abroad gets a basic cost-of-living allowance."
"The status of the Erasmus-funded student is of little comfort to the young student or researcher seeking the international experience."
"Mr President, going from ECU 25 million to ECU 75 million is a major achievement."
"This is all down to Mrs Pack and at this point let me thank her most sincerely for her successful efforts."
"As part of the debate on the eastwards enlargement of the EU we must be careful to ensure that these new member countries also have access to the European education programmes."
"But this cannot be done without the financial means."
"One of the most important points concerns the preparation of the countries in question and the creation of a solid basis for universal education and vocational training."
"I am sure that their involvement in the Community programmes will have a positive effect on the participants and that this represents an excellent basis for preparing for membership."
"How else should young people better learn about democracy than in an exchange with other young people in Europe?"
"And I am in no way excluding Turkey from these considerations."
"Here too, participation in the various programmes will help young people greatly increase their understanding of the democratic processes and I would very much welcome the opportunity to resume this debate in the coming months with my report to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, where I am hoping for support."
"Now I am anxious to know how the programmes are progressing."
"We will have to carry out a census in order to identify and retain those which are successful."
"Admittedly some aspects deserve criticism, such as the amount spent on application procedures."
"I also hope that we can count on increased resources for adult education purposes."
"Lifelong learning is now more important than ever and we must continue to impress this on the national consciousness."
"The 1996 European Year of Lifelong Learning has already proved successful and it would be logical to follow this up by launching projects within the Socrates and Leonardo programmes."
"Finally, let me say how much I welcome the increasing emphasis being placed on quality assurance in Socrates."
"I hope that the Council will support Parliament in its efforts to set up a European network."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is pleased to confirm that it has been possible to achieve agreement on Socrates within the conciliation procedure."
"The outcome is due in part to the fact that Parliament was prepared to prioritize the programme for 1998 and 1999."
"I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to give special thanks to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, and especially the Committee's chairman, Mr Pex, but of course most of all to the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, for the perseverance they have all shown, and also to those responsible for budgetary affairs, in particular Mr Samland and Mrs DÃ¼hrkop DÃ¼hrkop, who have done a great deal of work, as we have heard during the debate here this evening."
"The conciliation procedure has thus very quickly led to a result which all the institutions can support."
"That shows how successful the programme is and that there is the desire to put the programme in a better position to fulfil the objectives set."
"It will, of course, be far from being a question of luxury, but it does involve a substantial sum, and it will be noticeable in connection with all the activities under the programme."
"The Socrates programme provides a solid basis for the future."
"We therefore value the input you have made during the conciliation procedure in order to achieve a result which clearly shows that the Union wants to create an even closer relationship with its citizens."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Wild animals in zoos"
"The next item is report (A4-0010/98) by Mr White, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council recommendation relating to the keeping of wild animals in zoos COM(95)0619 - C4-0103/96-95/0333(SYN)."
"- Mr President, we really need an EU directive on the protection of wild animals in zoos."
"A simple recommendation on how the EU States should keep their zoos would be non-binding, non-enforceable and would just not be good enough."
"Some zoos in the European Union are little more than concentration camps for animals."
"People who visit them with their eyes open will see animals who are distressed and demented within their confined enclosures."
"Minimum rules to protect these animals are long overdue."
"From an educational point of view zoos can be highly misleading, as they try to teach children that it is acceptable to keep wild animals in confined spaces."
"Educating children about the wide variety of animals in the world is hugely important but if wild animals are put on display in conditions vastly different to their natural habitats, the effect is mis-educational."
"It would be far better to use advances in interactive technology to give children an impression about natural habitats and the need to protect these habitats and preserve them."
"The argument that zoos are essential to the conservation of endangered species is not borne out by experience."
"In many cases there has been a much higher death rate among zoo animals than among their counterparts in the wild."
"For example, in Dublin Zoo almost fifty per cent of all the hippos born there over the last decade have died in infancy."
"That is a mortality rate several times higher than for hippos in the wild."
"Furthermore, the very highlighted role of zoos in conservation of endangered species is wildly exaggerated."
"Research by the wild life organization Born Free has shown that only three per cent of animals held in world zoos belong to internationally recognised captive breeding programmes."
"There is no doubt that certain species of animals like, notably, large cats, birds, elephants and giraffes experience recurring problems in zoos."
"These animals are kept in zoos solely to attract people through the entrance gate and it is wrong and dishonest of people to suggest otherwise."
"Finally, I would just like to say that the experience of Dublin Zoo, for example, last year was extremely disturbing."
"There were a huge number of events where questions need to be answered."
"Eleven penguins died and that has not been explained; there was only one that actually survived."
"As well as that, there was a rhino that tried to escape and was shot without using a tranquillizer to minimize the pain; that has also not been explained."
"Zoos are unessential in this so-called civilized world of today."
"- Mr President, I strongly support this report and I very much hope the Commission will take the view of the Parliament that we want a directive on the management of zoos."
"I speak in my capacity as President of the European Parliament's All Party Group for Animal Welfare."
"There is a longstanding pressure from this Parliament for a directive."
"The sad thing is that some six or seven years ago there was almost a total agreement with the need for this directive from the Parliament, Commission and the more responsible people who manage zoos."
"This fell foul of the rather silly argument about subsidiarity."
"This is an area where it is sensible that the decision should be made at European level."
"We want to ensure that proper standards are maintained right across the European Union."
"We have heard one of two speeches this evening by people who question whether we really need zoos at all."
"I do not entirely go along that road but I do take the view that zoos that do not maintain the best possible standard and the most natural environmental conditions for their animals are unacceptable and should not exist."
"So we want these high standards."
"As the rapporteur said, there is a considerable interchange of animals between different zoos."
"This is often inhibited because, quite rightly, zoos which are responsible organizations and care properly for their animals are reluctant to transfer them to zoos that are not."
"Countries that do not maintain the very best standards for their zoos lose out in this way, and incidentally lose out on tourism."
"Zoos are attractive from a tourist point of view but tourists will not go to those countries again and visit their zoos if they see the animals are not being properly cared for."
"It is in everyone's interests that we should maintain the very highest possible standards and I hope that this report has some success in pushing that aim forward."
"Mr President, I believe there is only one issue that is really facing this Parliament and I thank Mr White for bringing forward this report in the way that he has done."
"There is a great deal of unanimity in the Parliament on most animal welfare issues."
"We have been the main institution at European level that has driven animal welfare forward as an issue at all."
"I personally am a staunch supporter of stricter animal welfare laws and this Parliament's leading in the field of animal protection. Whether it be farm animals, animals in transport or animals in laboratories, it is all part of the same issue."
"Zoos which we are discussing here tonight come into the same category."
"The issue of animal welfare in zoos has been, as pointed out, under discussion for a decade at least."
"It was a predecessor of ours, Sir James Scott-Hopkins, who raised the issue initially."
"Action is needed."
"Animal slums actually exist in Europe at the present time trading under the name of zoos and that is not good enough."
"If we want to do something, we have to do it properly."
"A recommendation which people can ignore is just not good enough."
"I hope, Commissioner, that you will be able to give us an answer tonight as to what your position will be if Parliament takes a very strong stance on this and calls for a directive rather than for a recommendation, which is what the Commission is currently proposing."
"I can foresee that the Commission will be extremely unpopular in this Parliament if they go against the will of the people."
"Subsidiarity has been mentioned and of course it is an issue but animal welfare as a subject is seen, in this Parliament especially, to transcend all matters of subsidiarity."
"I hope Commissioner that you will spell out quite clearly your own position because we must have a level playing field in this area, otherwise the people of Europe are going to be highly discontented with this Parliament and I believe with the Commission."
"Mr President, I was originally rather a sceptic about the idea of having a European directive on zoos but I have been converted to the idea by a number of considerations and I am grateful to Mr White for his generous reference to Sir James Scott-Hopkins when he introduced his report."
"First of all, we have to consider whether or not Europe is actually legislating, if it does legislate through a directive on zoos, in response to a popular demand."
"After all we do an awful lot of things that most people do not like, including the introduction of a single currency."
"The people of Europe must sometimes wonder whether there is anything going to come out of Brussels that they actually do want."
"We have heard enough today, at least from the British Members and also from Mrs Redondo and Mr Lindqvist to make us realize that this is actually rather a popular issue and would be sustained by a popular demand that Europe should act."
"The second issue, is it appropriate to consider this a European responsibility?"
"Mr White has referred to what happened at the Edinburgh Summit."
"My understanding of the chain of events was that essentially it was Chancellor Kohl who came in at one point and said: ' What we do not need is for Europe to go on fiddling around with detailed legislation; for example, there is this proposal for a directive on zoos, surely we can junk that one' and generally threw his weight around."
"And when Chancellor Kohl throws his weight around people tend to take notice."
"I disagree with that idea;"
"I think it is appropriate to consider this as an European initiative and I take issue with the point about subsidiarity."
"Subsidiarity does not necessarily mean, as Mr White has realized, that you pass legislation down to a lower level of responsibility."
"It means that you legislate at whatever level is most appropriate."
"It seems to me that in this instance we already have the idea that animal welfare is accepted as a part of the European Union's responsibilities."
"We should also take into account a point raised by Mrs McKenna which is that zoos look after part of the general environmental heritage."
"There is a sense in which a supranational body is the most appropriate body to look after that."
"The other question I would like to consider is will it be possible to enforce - I think it will."
"This is actually one of the directives it would be reasonably easy to enforce."
"My problem with Mr White's report is that I do not see how easy it will be to translate what has been proposed as a recommendation into a directive."
"What stance would the code of practice have?"
"Can you have a code of practice in a directive?"
"Would it be legally enforceable?"
"I also disagree with the rapporteur on seeking to widen the legal base to include Article 100a for reasons given in the Legal Committee's opinion."
"For once, I hope that Mr Kohl will be ignored."
"I hope that Mr White will be able to work on his government, which has written to me that they are not necessarily over the moon about the idea of a European directive on zoos, and I look forward very much to a positive response from the Commissioner."
"Mr President, as many speakers have mentioned, we are discussing a proposal which has been on the table for almost seven years."
"In all that time the wretched conditions for many animals in certain European zoos have not got much better. Indeed, in some they may even have got worse."
"I entirely agree with Parliament that this is unacceptable."
"Unfortunately this delay is due to irrelevant discussions which are not so much concerned with the content of the proposal as with the form any involvement by the Community should take."
"Parliament has consistently supported a directive, and I am sure that Mr Elliot, who is also in the All Party Group for Animal Welfare, and others can remember that I personally, both in the group and in reply to questions here in Parliament, have spoken in favour of a directive."
"I can therefore give a very simple answer to the question put by Mr White about why I gave him that written answer."
"It was because I considered it proper to sound out the new Commission and see whether it was possible to get a change in the view that it should be a recommendation, but it was not possible, and that is why Mr White received the answer concerned."
"It is, you see, the case that the Commission and the Council have unanimously decided that they do not want a Council Directive on animal welfare in zoos and that they think this should still be a matter which falls within the competence of the individual Member States."
"So that is where we stand today."
"Therefore, in my opinion, Parliament should consider whether there is not a possibility that the Community could make a meaningful and positive contribution by issuing a recommendation from the Council, because that could prompt the individual Member States to adopt appropriate rules."
"It may not be ideal, but it is better than nothing."
"It goes without saying that against this background the Commission will not be able to accept many of the amendments proposed by Parliament."
"I shall not go into details, but we cannot in fact accept any of the amendments apart from one, which Parliament will certainly think is quite unimportant."
"It think it can be said that the report concerned contains the elements required to form a basis on which the Member States can quickly adopt appropriate regulations."
"I am convinced that animal welfare organizations in individual Member States will contribute to reasonable supervision."
"So, against the background of the information available, I would recommend that we try to progress with a recommendation."
"Thank you, Madam Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.45 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, during the sitting yesterday adjournment of a debate was requested under Rule 131."
"The debate covered asylum rights and the adjournment was requested by Mr Schulz."
"It can happen, of course, that adjournment has to be requested, but we have a feeling that the Socialist Group plays these kind of tricks every time."
"We saw it last week at the part-session in Strasbourg during the debate on drugs policy which was adjourned on the same grounds, and yesterday we had to witness this trick with regard to asylum policy."
"We are under the impression that the Socialist Group does this when they cannot win a debate."
"It was clear that on drugs policy they were going to lose gloriously in the House."
"It was clear that on asylum policy the opinion of the Socialist Group was not going to be shared by the majority of the House."
"Mr Nassauer made that clear more than once to the Socialist Group."
"Using Rule 131 to spring surprises on Parliament does not fit in with the mores of the House."
"I have become familiar with the excuses of the Socialist Group, but I do think that on this point we have to make agreements in advance."
"It is not acceptable to spring surprises on one another."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, I let you speak for longer than your allotted speaking time, but I would like to ask the other members who have asked for the floor to keep to their speaking time."
"I assume that you wish to speak on the same subject, Mrs Fontaine."
"Madam President, I would like to address the same subject, that is, referral to committee of the asylum rights issues which were decided upon yesterday afternoon."
"Of course, I am not contesting the request for referral which is entirely in accordance with the rules, but rather the conditions under which the vote was taken."
"Only 51 Members were able to take part in the vote, and I feel, Madam President, that this number is not very representative of our House, particularly on such a sensitive issue as that."
"However, I think that we gained at least one thing from it all; we were able to carry our a very useful practical exercise in measuring the time and distance between our offices and the Chamber."
"I hope that this information will be recorded in the minutes."
"Many of us were trapped in the lifts which were, of course, stopping at every floor to admit colleagues who were hurrying to get there, and a large number of us arrived just a few minutes before the vote."
"Madam President, might I request that the Quaestors provide a rule which specifies that a period of 15 minutes be allowed between the first bell and the time of the vote."
"I feel that this proposal is very reasonable, and will submit it to the Quaestors."
"Madam President, I agree entirely with what Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mrs Fontaine have just said."
"On page 15 of the Minutes, I see that the president of the sitting responded to the speakers who raised the arguments just mentioned, saying that 'two Members spoke and this left enough time for Members to get to the Chamber' ."
"I would strongly reject this, because in fact a number of Members heard the bell and immediately hung up their phones, some quite casually according to their interlocutors, but they were not actually in a position to be able to vote."
"This is scandalous."
"I would point out that in national parliaments there is not just one bell - some of our colleagues even thought that it was a fire alarm."
"As already requested, Members' offices should be fitted with lights, as is the case in some parliaments; these would indicate when the vote is announced to give the Members the time they need to get to the Chamber."
"I would ask the Office and the College of Quaestors to tackle this issue."
"Madam President, I agree with what Mrs Fontaine and Mr Pasty have said but I should like to broaden the matter rather than narrow it down."
"We accept what happened yesterday on the floor of the House because it was under the existing rules."
"The unfortunate thing was that time was not allowed for Members to get here."
"It is Rules 126, 128, 129, 130, 131 and 132 which need to be looked at."
"Those rules say quite clearly that the vote will be taken immediately."
"What does immediately mean?"
"When the bells are rung it normally means that we have ten minutes before we get to the plenary for the start of a session."
"The bells rang yesterday, but as Mr Pasty quite rightly said, there was no other indication whatsoever what was going on in the Chamber."
"I recognize that we have just moved into a new building and the full scenes are not yet available on our television sets but it is an issue that the administration needs to address."
"Maybe this should go to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities so that the Rules can be changed to accommodate what happened yesterday."
"Madam President, I also want to complain about what happened last night."
"Not only was I not able to get to the vote but I was out of the House on parliamentary business and came back to speak."
"The world was waiting to hear my words on Socrates and was deprived of them."
"Changing parliamentary business at the last minute as was done on a very small vote last night is totally contrary to the spirit of democracy."
"Speaking on behalf of the Green Group, I utterly condemn what happened last night."
"(Mixed reactions)"
"Madam President, first of all I naturally reject what Mrs Oomen-Ruijten just said about the attitude of the Socialists."
"And I would go further than that: on page 14 of the Minutes it says that when Mrs DÃ­ez de Rivera - in other words, I - arrived in the Hemicycle yesterday after the bell rang for the vote, I protested there and then because we had not been given enough time to get to the vote, when it was an exceptional vote."
"So, Madam President, I agree with what Mr Pasty, Mrs Fontaine and Mr Provan said, but I was late, despite running out of my office."
"Therefore, once again I reject Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's criticism of the Socialist Group, and there is the proof that we all tried."
"Madam President, as is clearly apparent, the Social Democrats have also had difficulties getting to the vote concerned here."
"I am, of course, also sorry about the problems which other groups have had, but we tried to warn them in advance that we wanted to have a vote under Rule 131 because we believe that, after the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party had withdrawn their signature from the joint proposal, we needed more time to draw up a joint text on the right of asylum, which could also achieve broad support in this House."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think we are agreed that Rule 131 of the Rules of Procedure was the basis for the vote."
"So I am satisfied that the Rules of Procedure were correctly followed."
"However, I recognize that those Members who have expressed the view that the distance here is too great have some right on their side."
"I think it is the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, and not the Quaestors, who should look at that Rule and consider how we can make sure that this does not happen again."
"I have to say that my own office is on the 12th floor, and I also heard the ringing;"
"I got here just as the vote was taking place."
"It was certainly very tight and we cannot allow that to happen in the future."
"For the time being, I am bound to say that matters were conducted in accordance with the rules yesterday."
"During the next part-session, the Conference of Presidents will have to decide where this will come on the agenda."
"However, I shall pass on the criticisms that have been made here both to the Bureau and to the Conference of Presidents. We can then decide whether to forward the matter to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, or whether, as Mrs Fontaine has suggested, we can find a simple solution in advance, so that we have acceptable arrangements in future."
"Madam President, what Mrs Jensen is saying is terrible."
"I like her, but we cannot have a situation whereby. when another group withdraws its signature under a resolution, Parliament no longer votes on a text."
"This is happening for the second time now."
"First it was drugs, now asylum policy."
"The Socialist Group is not going to make it and simply says: well, then we will withdraw it."
"This is unparliamentary behaviour."
"It does not fit in with the mores of the House."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, someone has already pointed out - I think it was Mr Provan - that we should have been informed that a vote was taking place and what it was about."
"I can only say that we all have a duty to look at the agenda."
"Everyone had a chance to check what was on the agenda, and everybody knew that according to the Rules of Procedure anyone can adjourn an item at any time."
"Those are the rules but I do have some sympathy for what has been said."
"Madam President, I would suggest one simple way of overcoming the problem of the distance between Members' offices and the Hemicycle."
"It is one that a colleague of mine has already adopted."
"It would simply be for Parliament to provide all Members with bicycles."
"Thank you very much, Mr Watson!"
"Training of seafarers"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0411/97) by Mr Parodi, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Directive amending Directive 94/58/EEC on the minimum level of training of seafarers."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment to the Directive on the minimum level of training for seafarers, which is the subject of the present recommendation, was prompted by the need to adapt the training of seafarers to suit the actual conditions which pertain in maritime transport, in particular the new technological developments which have been introduced on board ships and new methods of occupational training."
"Let us not forget that 80 % of maritime accidents can be directly attributed to human errors or omissions."
"The objective of the revision of the STCW Convention and the associated amendment to Directive 94/58/EEC is to remedy this situation and, if possible, to lessen the impact of the human factor on maritime accidents."
"This goal can be achieved by establishing minimum requirements for the occupational training and watch-keeping certification of seafarers, providing effective control of the application of international regulations and preventing the credibility of the certificates issued from being damaged by a general failure to comply with the provisions of the Convention, as has happened in the past."
"In my judgement, therefore, this amendment must be regarded in a positive light, as it represents a step towards increased safety and reinforces the powers of the IMO with regard to procedures, the supervision of training methods and certification."
"At first reading, the guiding principle I adopted when drafting my report, with the decisive support of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, was to improve and consolidate as far as possible the proposal for a directive by eliminating any uncertainties in law and legal disputes concerning the obligations of Member States with regard to the issuing and recognition of seafarer's training certificates, thereby preventing the employment of barely qualified crews."
"In fact, I believe that a rationalization or harmonization of the criteria used for recognizing qualifications, coupled with the adoption of strict quality requirements, may help to raise seafarers' level of competence, improve the safety and competitiveness of the Community fleet and reduce the number of substandard ships."
"As I have said before, safety is at stake; however, I must add that the Commission has amended its initial proposal in light of the first reading."
"The Council's common position has welcomed the sense, the concept and the objectives which are an integral part of the amendments made to the provisions of the original proposal."
"In fact, the Council has reworded a number of paragraphs in the initial proposal."
"It has also introduced new paragraphs which are more in line with Parliament's wishes and whose objective is to increase safety."
"The new articles concern the rules governing coastal shipping, sanctions and disciplinary arrangements, quality standards, medical requirements, the issuing and registration of certificates, the liability of shipping companies and the inspection of landing facilities."
"These are articles which, together with the other amendments, have the merit of removing uncertainties and simplifying interpretation."
"In conclusion, at this point I believe that the common position and the position expressed by the European Parliament which inspired the amendments have been fully taken on board by the Council."
"Thanks to these amendments and the present improvements, it will be possible to take a further step towards increasing safety at sea, an objective which Parliament has been pursuing for many years and which we shall continue to pursue."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to begin by expressing my wholehearted support for this proposal for a directive amending the original directive on the minimum level of training of seafarers."
"It is another positive step in the improvement of both safety at sea and the protection of our very important marine environment."
"Bearing in mind that over the past decade we have lost some 12, 000 lives at sea throughout the world - and, indeed, continue to lose more than 200 ships a year throughout the world, we in the European Union need to be constantly on guard to enhance and improve the standards of safety at sea."
"The essential essence of this directive is to address the human factor."
"As the rapporteur, Mr Parodi, quite rightly pointed out, some 80 % of maritime accidents are attributable to human error and therefore this key issue should play an important part in our maritime strategy to enhance safety and protect the environment."
"It is vital that seafarers receive the necessary high level of training and certification in order to reach the level of competence and skill needed during their service at sea, to be able to communicate effectively with the crew, follow instructions and advice and, on occasion - all too often I fear - deal with crisis situations."
"Vessels must be crewed by seafarers who possess the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge."
"This current proposal seeks to incorporate the requirements of the 1995 Convention on the standards of training of certification and watch-keeping for seafarers."
"I would like to congratulate the Commission not only for keeping pace with international maritime law but transposing it into Community legislation to ensure that it is effective throughout our European waters."
"I hope that the Commission will continue to maintain this pace of improving safety at sea."
"This proposal for a directive seeks to include the new training and certification requirements, including watchkeeping requirements and to introduce common criteria for the recognition of seafarers' certificates issued by third countries."
"Like Mr Parodi, I was pleased that the Council, with the support of the Commission, has incorporated most of the ideas and objectives of the European Parliament in the first reading."
"I am pleased to say that Mr Parodi successfully managed to further clarify and enhance the Commission proposal, removing uncertainties and simplifying the text."
"I was particularly impressed with the emphasis which the rapporteur put on the need to attract young people into the maritime profession and to promote the employment of seafarers."
"In its recent communication 'Towards a Maritime Strategy' , the Commission indicated that there is a worldwide shortage of qualified and able seafarers."
"Developing a European policy to bring young people into the profession is a vital means of providing both highquality seafarers and helping resolve the problems of unemployment in Europe, not least in our maritime communities."
"I would like to take this opportunity to commend the rapporteur on the importance he placed on having a common working language to be able to work effectively and, in particular, handle crisis situations."
"I look forward to the implementation of this directive in Member States as another positive move in our campaign for maritime safety."
"I would conclude by urging the Commission to ensure that this amendment to the directive is implemented, is transposed and is enforced by the Member States."
"We have recently had a report that some 60 % of all transport internal market directives have yet to be transposed by the Member States."
"Perhaps the Commissioner would like to comment on how best we can ensure that this very worthy directive is not only supported here in this House, implemented by the Council but is actually implemented on the ground by the Member States and their enforcement agencies."
"Indeed, I would like to see some mechanism whereby we can have a regular reporting mechanism to ensure that safety standards throughout the EU are not only maintained but are implemented and enforced at a high level."
"Madam President, on behalf of the European People's Party I must stress that we too support the common position, as amended by the Committee on Transport's three amendments, which we already approved in committee."
"I must point out that the proposal being considered amends Directive 94/58/EEC, which was adopted by this Parliament, and also that it is a directive which has largely been incorporated into the national legislations."
"Consequently, I am optimistic that the amendments to that first directive, concerning which we have the present common position, will enjoy equally rapid incorporation into national laws."
"This new amending directive certainly represents great progress."
"Its most important point is that it introduces measures which could constitute incentives to attract new young seafarers."
"On the other hand, the new directive clears the picture, because it makes a clear distinction between matters relating to the training and recruitment of seafarers, and those relating to how crews on ships operate."
"I must therefore say that while we all welcome this progress achieved by the new, supplementary directive, it should at the same time be noted that the Commission has not adopted initiatives in the area of positive measures on behalf of European shipping."
"We make progress with safety issues, we extend the controls applied to ships in European ports and in terms of the ability of the crews that man the ships, any ships, and steer them into European ports, but we have still done nothing to propose positive measures to stop shipping from abandoning European flags."
"The Commission has been slow about that."
"It seems that there is a dearth of ideas in the Commission, that it has no proposals to offer."
"There is of course a proposal on shipping strategy, but because of the many problems it created, that has somewhat fogged the whole picture of European shipping policy."
"I should like to say, however, that it is time for, and we are waiting to see, a new spirit, a new approach to the issue of positive measures on behalf of shipping, because we continue to progress haphazardly either via second ships' registers, and now every country is setting up a second ships' register, or by continually running down the European flags to the benefit of other, improbable flags, and I stress this point."
"There are tiny islands which have large merchant fleets."
"This is not the right time to point out the dangers in that, but from the floor of Parliament I once more call on the Commission to reflect on how it could deal with the problem we know as 'positive measures on behalf of shipping' ."
"Madam President, I too think that the report by Mr Parodi contributes greatly towards improving the Council Directive amending Directive 94/58/EEC, and our group supports it."
"Of course, I would like to mention two reservations or questions, ones that stem at least from our experience of Greek shipping, granted that Greece has one of the largest merchant fleets in the European Union."
"The first reservation relates to the statement that 80 % of accidents are caused by human error."
"The experience we have from Greece is that while human error certainly plays a major part, a very large proportion of accidents are caused by the operation of old vessels which can only respond to bad weather or other problems with great difficulty. I could accept Mr Parodi's argument if, under the heading of human error, we included neglect, criminal neglect and the criminal cover-ups often associated with the operation of such vessels."
"My second reservation relates to the recruitment of young people to ships and this is an orientation that is very important indeed."
"However, once again our problem in Greece is not that the young are not attracted into training with a view to having a professional career in shipping, but that the labour market for shipping is constantly being restricted, decreasing and contracting, despite the fact that Greece has a very large merchant fleet."
"And that, in my opinion, is because shipowners all too often pursue a policy of recruiting cheap, ill-trained crews from third countries, from Asian countries etc., with the result that, not only is the labour market reduced in the Community area, but there is also a lack of safety in the operation of the vessels."
"The three amendments insisted upon by Mr Parodi have our support, in relation both to medical fitness and to watch-keeping conditions on the bridge, as well as the subject of restricted rest periods."
"In particular, however, we should note the matter of verbal communication."
"There is often a very great problem with verbal communication among the crew, which often leads to accidents."
"And I would like to say that Greece has recently suffered two major shipping disasters, with many lives lost at sea, which took place during the holidays."
"Madam President, I should like to join in the congratulations to Mr Parodi for his excellent work and welcome the constructive nature of this whole debate."
"I would also like to echo the points made by Mr Watts about the dangerous nature of seafaring."
"We broadly support the whole thrust of this report."
"Like Mr Sarlis and Mr Alavanos, however, I share the concern about crews from third countries which are an increasing phenomenon in the EU shipping area."
"It is causing a lot of concern, not only in Scotland where I come from, but over a huge range of European countries."
"It will be helpful for the port states to have a role in this."
"They will be crucial in enforcing the standards which we rightly expect of the European countries."
"I would like to say to Commissioner Bjeregaard that the challenge now from the point of view of the European citizens is to see that the standards that we expect are applied to those third country crews."
"Otherwise, there is a grave danger that a lack of fluency in the right language, the failure to be able to communicate could put lives at risk."
"In a year when a large box-office draw is a film about the sinking of the Titanic , we need no reminder how terrible disasters are and we want to do everything possible to prevent their occurrence."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there are a considerable number of accidents caused by human error in the domain of seafaring which have serious consequences for human life or for flora and fauna."
"In far too many cases, ships show the flag of convenience and are manned by non-Community crews, so ensuring a cheap workforce."
"The National Front has always denounced this movement of workers which means using an under-qualified, non-European workforce."
"Not only is this harmful to employment, but it is also endangers the safety of ships and of our coasts."
"We must oppose the concept of social dumping which pays a Polish or Chinese sailor FF 2500 per month, where a French sailor gets FF 10 000."
"We can only relaunch and protect this sector by adopting a systematic policy of national preference for employing sailors, and direct or indirect financial support for its own shipping fleet by each country."
"So we welcome the report by Mr Parodi which aims to promote an adequate level of sufficiently harmonized training and professional competence which will increase safety of seafaring within European."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think this is a good example of how the Council of Ministers and the Parliament can work together."
"In response to a good proposal by the Commission we have essentially agreed in two readings on how the training of seafarers could be improved, with particular reference to their protection and to protecting our citizens and the environment."
"As various Members have already said, substandard ships are the nub of the matter, although I must tell my friend from Greece that I am not quite sure if I would include old ships."
"Ships may be very old, yet if they are well maintained and have a good crew, they are highly seaworthy."
"I sincerely believe that the human factor is one of the main causes of accidents, and - we are lucky in having the right Commissioner with us this morning - accidents at sea often result in dreadful pollution which put nature and the sea seriously at risk."
"Training seafarers so as to avoid accidents can accordingly make an indirect contribution to preventing sea pollution and to environmental protection."
"I believe it is particularly important that watchkeeping requirements have been tightened up."
"But it is my belief, whether the Titanic is a good example or not, that they knew what was happening."
"They just needed to react properly."
"However, the economic interests of the company outweighed the need to protect passengers."
"We must make sure that never happens again, so I believe that these watchkeeping requirements are very good."
"But watchkeeping is not of course the end of the story."
"Mr Parodi has once again brought forward a very good proposal from the first reading."
"Madam Commissioner, it would be wonderful if you could give this additional Parliament amendment your support, as its aim is even more stringent treatment of exceptional circumstances in relation to watchkeeping, and I believe that safety at sea must come first."
"On the latter point, I should like to support what my colleague has said."
"It is no good at all if the Parliament and the Council, in conjunction with the Commission, make excellent law, and if Member States implement this law by amending training regulations, if the same Member States then fail to ensure that checks are carried out under Port State Control to ensure that ships are, in practice, only crewed by well trained seafarers."
"In this context I think we need to ask the Commission, regardless of subsidiarity, to check whether training regulations are being adhered to, under Port State Control."
"Madam President, I am very pleased that the rapporteur, Mr Parodi, is satisfied with the main approach of the Council's common position on the training of seafarers, just as most of the speakers have been."
"I therefore also hope that Parliament will approve it at the part-session."
"The Commission considers the joint position to be acceptable throughout because it is in agreement with the principles in the original proposal which was supported by Parliament."
"In addition, it represents a clarification and, in particular, greater consistency in relation to internationally recognized requirements found in the revised STCW Convention of 1995."
"In addition, as Mr Parodi states in his recommendation, account has been taken of the substance of the most important of the amendments which Parliament adopted during the first reading."
"I would therefore like to urge Parliament not to insist on the amendments set out in the report, because they are actually contrary to the three fundamental principles of the directive."
"The common position has been formulated so that it agrees as far as possible with the STCW Convention of 1995."
"Amendment No 1 weakens this relationship because it changes wording which precisely corresponds to Rule 1/9 No 1 of the Convention."
"I hope Parliament can recognize that it does not really make sense to deviate from this principle."
"Another fundamental principle is that the amending directive must not make the non-binding part B of the STCW Code, which serves as a guideline for the national authorities, binding."
"However, the addition proposed in Amendment No 2 corresponds to the wording of the non-binding part B, while the common position is in full agreement with the binding part A. Parliament will in any case be aware that the question of non-binding guidelines is discussed in the seventh consideration in the common position."
"The third principle is to maintain the spirit of Directive 94/58/EEC which deals with standards for the training of seafarers."
"It was never intended that the directive should deal with watchkeeping conditions as such."
"Within the framework of the directive, the Commission and Parliament have succeeded in persuading the Council to incorporate certain rules on watchkeeping conditions in Article 5 H, on fitness for service, into the common position, namely rules on preventing fatigue and the associated safety risks."
"These concern minim um rest periods which several of the speakers have also mentioned."
"I hope against this background that Parliament agrees that the rule on watchkeeping conditions in Amendment No 3 is not appropriate for this directive."
"Madam President, I have tried to explain as fully as and clearly as possible why the Commission cannot support the proposed amendments."
"I hereby urge Parliament to reconsider its provisional position on the proposal so that we can get this legislation in place as soon as possible."
"Madam President, if the Commissioner is going to ask us after such long discussions to reconsider our amendments again, then I for one believe that it would be much better for us to adopt the three amendments and ask the Commission to consider their position again, because their presentation was incomprehensible!"
"Madam President, a number of Members raised a key issue, namely that it is all very well for this Parliament, the Commission and the Council agreeing legislation but how do we ensure that it is respected, not only by all Member States but also with regard to ships flying flags of convenience?"
"I understand that this it is difficult for the Commissioner to react immediately but on a future occasion we would like a response from the Commission as to how we can ensure that this very worthy legislation is uniformly applied throughout European waters to ships, irrespective of flag."
"Madam President, very briefly I should like to say to the Commission that I have noted a certain hardening of its attitude. Let me explain."
"While we make ourselves available to resolve a very serious problem which certainly merits much greater attention, I do not think we should be asked to do a U-turn. Rather, it is the Commission which should be looking more towards the future and taking decisions more in keeping with the wishes of fifteen countries who are asking for this."
"Madam President, it is clear that I will pass on the message which Parliament has given today, but as you know it is not the Commission alone which decides whether anything will come of a piece of legislation."
"What I expressed hope for in my closing remarks was that we could get the proposed legislation implemented soon."
"I feel quite certain that my fellow commissioner, Mr Kinnock, will be very careful in ensuring that the Member States also comply with the legislation which is adopted, and will also make use of the fund we have available for the implementation of the adopted legislation."
"But the request concerned the fact that we are very keen to have a piece of legislation adopted soon."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m."
"Trans-European hydrological networks"
"The next item is the report (A4-0407/97) by Mr Izquierdo Collado, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the technological feasibility of trans-European hydraulic networks."
"Madam President, in Parliament we have had some very important - I would even say beautiful - debates about water, thinking about water as a resource and an essential part of culture, which even distinguishes the cultures of different peoples."
"This aspect of water, as a basic resource, is becoming more significant as time goes by, and it is already apparent that in the next century those water resources will become even more important."
"The European Union must keep a very careful eye on this fundamental aspect of sustainable development and peaceful coexistence within Europe, and this is what we are working towards in Parliament."
"What has the European Union done about water resources?"
"It has done some important things, but always focusing on water quality."
"Obviously, at the moment, when we are so concerned about atmospheric pollution, and world summits are being held to protect the ozone layer, the quality of water resources needs to be protected firmly and vigorously."
"I think the Commission is clear about that."
"At the moment, it is preparing a directive which, unfortunately, is incomplete."
"We have received a communication and a correction, and another correction is in progress, which perhaps does not give the best impression of the directive."
"However, the European Union is undeniably doing something about water quality."
"I believe it is essential to protect our water, and work in that direction must continue."
"Well, Madam President, in addition to quality, we also need to talk about the quantity of water."
"While we were carrying out a study into this, through STOA, and during the Parliamentary initiative, Commissioner Bjerregaard, who is here with us now - and is not listening to my speech at the moment because she is not wearing her headphones - had the good sense to speak on behalf of the European Union about the amount of water, almost for the first time."
"She did so following her visit to Seville, in Andalusia, where she was able to see that talking just about the quality of water will not solve the European Union's many water problems."
"And indeed, the European Union can contribute that element of added value so that the optimization of water resources, at EU level, can be a reality."
"Obviously, the Member States are working on their catchment area plans, and those plans are necessary in order to rationalize the various hydrological basins so that water resources can be rationalized in those areas where, for geographical reasons, such steps are necessary."
"But we have to go a step further and carry out transfers of water between the basins if we want to provide solutions to the structural problems which arise within the European Union, such as flooding, drought and desertification."
"Therefore, to a large extent, my initiative report attempts to draw attention to the fact that we need a European hydrological plan, and it is our duty to start designing it now: a plan which considers the overall needs of the European Union, and therefore administers water resources efficiently, constantly and strategically, protecting the environment, of course, and allowing it to be reactivated and improved through the use of that water."
"In the report I give an example, which could be applied to other areas: connecting the basins of central and northern Europe with basins in the south which are short of water."
"This would have no noticeable negative effect on the basins in the centre and the north, and the added value which could be contributed by transferring certain quantities of water could provide the answer for improving the hydrological plans of the southern Member States. These Member States' plans are necessary but cannot be put into operation, because the prolonged droughts of six or even seven years mean that the basins in the south which normally have an excess cannot transfer water to the southern States' own deficient basins."
"I want to conclude by saying that the report is highly sympathetic to the fact that water is an extremely sensitive subject, and makes it absolutely clear that no water could be taken from any Member State without its express consent."
"Madam Commissioner, I think there is a chance for us to work in this direction, and people are very hopeful that the Commission may be able to work to further this report, if it is approved by Parliament."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Izquierdo Collado, for his excellent report."
"The report underscores the problems of the uneven distribution of water resources in the countries of the European Union, for example, between northern and southern Europe."
"So it is important not to ignore the angle of studying the technological feasibility of a given network which could effectively resolve the issue of water shortages in certain regions of Europe."
"Of course, the study must show us that a viable solution exists, and this is why I insist that it is important that the European Commission gets this prospective study underway."
"We do not have a great deal of experience of this in Europe."
"We only know about the draft study between the regions Languedoc-Roussillon, in southern France, and the Barcelona region in Spain."
"So as a Frenchwoman, I am particularly interested in this subject."
"A prospective study on transferring water between two European regions must define the needs, the possibilities and also the different impacts and the potential which exists in Europe."
"It must be a comprehensive study, taking into account any effects of this type of network on the management of water resources."
"The rapporteur has of course explained that fully."
"At an environmental level, this study must be accompanied by specific investigations which take into account all environmental aspects, such as the impact on landscapes, natural surroundings, ecosystems and human activity."
"I would also like to make an important point clear to all our colleagues, as the rapporteur has done: a project of this sort, if it is feasible, cannot come about without the agreement of the country which would be required to transfer part of its water resources to a region suffering from an imbalance in its resources."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr Izquierdo Collado for his hard work but also for his astuteness in picking a subject of paramount importance and for approaching his work in a spirit of scientific and technological inquiry."
"He used a STOA inquiry which is exactly what we should do in this Parliament to test our views."
"That STOA study made it absolutely clear that this is something the European Union should tackle."
"Of course, it is an overwhelmingly important subject. It will dominate us in the 21st century."
"We must look not simply at the quality of water but at its location, its availability, and how it is managed."
"We need a European audit of water in our Community."
"Water was identified as one of the key areas when the task forces were set up by Mrs Cresson."
"We need studies on reforestation."
"We need to learn from the mistakes of the last two or three centuries which have left parts of the world as desert."
"We need to look at how water can be retained."
"We need to look at the location of water and how infrastructures could be used."
"In doing all these studies we must look at the impact they will have on the environment."
"The pilot scheme which I commend in Mr Izquierdo Collado's report would be an excellent way of seeing in practice how this would be feasible."
"This continent will have to study water very soon."
"Let us not wait for more crises."
"We need rigorous and exhaustive impact studies before any such scheme takes place."
"That is one condition."
"The other, as Mr Collado has said, is the wholehearted and informed consent of any Member State whose water supply is involved in such a hydraulic network."
"Madam President, the first thing I want to say is that we think this initiative report by Mr Izquierdo Collado is very timely, but, at the moment, it is just a technological evaluation of the feasibility of these trans-European hydrological networks."
"In this Parliament, and in the European Union, we are working on the Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Development, which places great importance on the question of water."
"And that importance, ladies and gentlemen, is due to the fact that most of us in this House are convinced - some are not, but they will soon see - that water is far more important than oil, gas or any other form of energy, because without water there is no life."
"However, anything that comes out of this study must definitely be included in the water management policy which, as Mr Izquierdo Collado said, is in its infancy in the European Union."
"Whoever does this study will of course firstly have to take into account an analysis of the alternatives. The first alternative is to use water better."
"We can save a lot of water if we use it better."
"Secondly, we have to consider other sources, such as the desalination of sea-water, for example. That is essential for the European Union, in order to produce technological equipment which could be exported to other countries, given that the big problem of the 21st century will be water."
"It is possible there may be wars over water, ladies and gentlemen."
"So we are talking about an enormously important technological question."
"Thirdly, there will need to be an assessment of the energy balance-sheet. It seems to me that this is the big difficulty which these hydrological networks will encounter."
"If they use up too much energy or if the results are energetically unacceptable, these networks will not be much use."
"In any case, however, there are many hydrological basins which have already been connected, with transfers being made from one to another."
"But it is only natural that we should first make these connections and perform these transfers within our own countries."
"Madam President, Spain, where both Mr Izquierdo Collado and I come from, has a great deal of water, but it is not very well distributed, either in time or in geographical location."
"It is all up in the north, around Cantabria, with very little in the south."
"Therefore, we will study these actions in the centre of our country very carefully and, if appropriate, and if the Union makes that decision, we would join in with a water policy based on hydrological networks."
"Obviously, the economic aspects will need to be studied."
"Water is badly treated and not given the consideration it deserves: it does not receive sufficient financial resources, especially at municipal level."
"I think whoever does the technological evaluation work will have to bear that in mind."
"Obviously, there has to be an environmental impact assessment - European legislation demands that - but there would also have to be a strategic assessment of the plans themselves."
"I want to inform the rapporteur that the Group of the European People's Party will support his report, although some of our members have certain doubts, perhaps because they see this important question in a different light."
"However, I congratulate him in any case."
"Madam President, this may appear to be a rather out-of-the-way issue for us in the European Parliament."
"However, water is vital for everyone."
"It is a natural resource which everyone needs for survival, so it is natural for us to discuss it here."
"Two questions must, however, be asked."
"The first question is whether this is a matter for the European Union."
"Or is it a matter which naturally falls under the principle of subsidiarity, i.e. is it the responsibility of the Member States?"
"The other question is whether the proposals presented in this report are good."
"Are the large-scale proposals for the interconnection of European hydrological networks good?"
"I shall attempt to answer these two questions on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party."
"Firstly, it is currently the case that all rules which regulate natural resources are national. For example, in all countries we have national legislation for forests, land and water."
"That is natural, since forests and land lie within the nation states."
"Even for water we have national legislation."
"But there is a difference: water flows between different countries, rivers flow through different countries and lake systems are shared."
"Therefore, there is a common interest in safeguarding water as a natural resource, both with regard to the quality of the water and ensuring that everyone has a share of it."
"So the question is this: is the proposal to interconnect hydrological networks good?"
"We must really question whether this is the right way forward."
"Is it right that mankind should interfere with natural hydrological networks with large-scale exploitation and solutions?"
"We have no idea what consequences that could have for the ground water, the climate or the environment."
"It is also true that many of the problems which exist because of water shortage, droughts and floods, which we are trying to solve here, were caused by our human intervention, such as logging, plantations and earlier water controls."
"If we are going to do something, we must first of all optimize the installations which already exist in order to make better use of the water in Europe."
"To conclude: water is primarily a national concern, but with some common responsibility to use it sensibly and for everyone to share in it."
"The Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party accepts a study, but it should first of all be directed at existing installations."
"I myself am going to abstain from voting."
"Mr President, this report by Mr Collado emphasizes that within the countries of the EU there are different conditions as far as access to water is concerned."
"In one region there may be a shortage of water, while in another on certain occasions there is a great surplus of water."
"This is quite simply governed by the laws of nature."
"To then suggest, as the rapporteur does, that we should take initiatives to try to restrain the laws of nature and to redistribute the water, so that it is more evenly distributed in the EU countries, is quite alien to me."
"The truth is also that it is often mankind that is largely behind the water problems we have, through, amongst other things, agriculture or through the building of various infrastructure projects."
"One example of this is HallandsÃ¥sen in Sweden, where the ground water was lowered according to the criteria determined for the building of a tunnel through the ridge."
"Mankind's way of living gives us a number of explanations for today's problems with water shortages or surpluses of water."
"It seems as if people now believe the solution is to manipulate water courses further."
"Such a measure involves interference with nature."
"That is generally irreversible and therefore it should not be done, out of regard for the principle of caution."
"Of course we should consider the issue of water here in Parliament, because the kind of water we have is vital."
"Above all it is water quality that can be an EU issue, and where we at EU level should try to achieve something."
"There should be no interference with nature to change or manipulate water flows."
"The Green Group in the European Parliament is not going to support this report and will therefore vote against it in the final vote, just as we did when it was discussed in committee."
"Mr President, I first want to express our most decided support for the report presented by Mr Izquierdo Collado, and especially for the implicit message contained in that report, which I think everybody has noticed, since the actual implementation of trans-European hydrological networks represents an important way of contributing to economic and social cohesion."
"I do not think it is a question of governing the rain, as has been said here, but rather of somehow reusing it, or being well prepared, so as not to lose a single drop of that vital liquid, and to avoid the floods which have also been mentioned here so many times."
"I think UNESCO has also made a statement along these lines, saying that 12 million people currently die every year because of a lack of water, and warning that in 25 years' time more than 50 countries will be short of that vital liquid, and that potentially serious situations may even arise as a result."
"In fact, we should be aware that international legislation in this area is inadequate. Many countries do not even know the extent of their water resources."
"In that sense, I should like to mention the proposal being studied and discussed by UNESCO at the moment, that the age-old Water Tribunal of Valencia could be adopted in the future as an international point of reference, to help avoid some of the potential conflicts which might arise in the 21st century."
"The shortage of water in certain areas represents an additional natural problem, and in order to overcome it we should act together, and from this Parliament, to urge all the peoples of Europe to show solidarity and promote really sustainable development in all the European regions. Hydrological networks, Mr President, have a lot to do with that development."
"The creation of a trans-European hydrological network would therefore be a good way of contributing to the development of those regions. In that way, a common asset - water - would contribute to a common objective - Europe."
"Mr President, the report by Mr Izquierdo Collado deals with a subject whose importance has not yet been fully recognized; in the next few decades, water is likely to become an ever more critical factor in geostrategic terms."
"Neither must we lose sight of the fact that if water resources decrease considerably, especially, but not solely in southern Europe, then this is primarily a result of often irresponsible human activity."
"Before establishing the feasibility of setting up trans-European water networks, we must first ask if this is what we want."
"Of course, not all nations are equal in terms of water resources."
"But we would be wrong to believe that water is more or less limitless in some countries."
"By seeking to share wealth, we risk sharing shortages."
"A desire to transport drinking water over hundreds or thousands of kilometres may be satisfactory for certain industrialists, but for the importing regions this would surely be an admission of failure, and would signify giving up a real water policy."
"This policy can only be local, based on safeguarding wetlands, preserving estuaries, and implementing more sparing agriculture and industry, recycling liquid waste, and if necessary, using the sophisticated technology of desalinating sea water."
"This resource must be managed as close as possible to the point of consumption."
"Rain water should be examined, collected and its drainage towards ground water facilitated."
"This is exactly the opposite of what intensive methods of production and national and regional development have done for 50 years."
"We must stop tearing down our hedges, filling up our ponds and concreting over our waterways."
"We must also redevelop the Mediterranean forest areas, damaged by fires: they have their part to play in restoring water reserves."
"On the contrary, a continental network of water transport would represent waste, irresponsibility and could end in shortages if we do not take care."
"Moreover, I am surprised by the absence in this report of any mention of using water networks to transport merchandise, where possible, at a time when road and rail networks are saturated, or even for passenger transport within the framework of tourism."
"To sum up, I would stress that in order to improve the problems of real water shortages, it is our priority to take action to stem the causes of desertification, and we can do this because most of these causes are human ones."
"It is important that priority goes to local action rather than launching a large-scale operation."
"Community solidarity should be expressed at this level."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we shall probably only really appreciate how important water is when we no longer have any."
"That is why it is no coincidence that our Spanish friend has picked this subject."
"I should like to give him my very firm support."
"Our friends from the northern countries have got somewhat excited about this here today, because they are afraid that the southern countries want to take away their water."
"In fact, just the opposite applies, as every tomato or orange from a southern country that we eat in the north actually means that we are taking water away from the south."
"Every tourist who travels to Spain or another southern country uses water."
"Assuming that everyone uses two to three litres of water a day, that means that tourists visiting Spain alone consume an additional 1 to 3 million cubic metres of water."
"So there is already a kind of trade in water, but it is hidden."
"Just think of all the bottles of mineral water, Perrier, Apolinaris, San Pellegrino or what you will, that are shipped all over the world."
"That is all trade in water, except that it is transported by bottle rather than by pipeline."
"At the time of the Roman Empire, they had a 70 kilometre long water pipeline in Cologne, and they also had similar things in other cities."
"Why should we not consider transfrontier water pipelines now?"
"It seems quite normal to me."
"Mr Pinel's comment earlier was correct."
"We need not only to work on water pipelines but also on proper management of available water. This seems so obvious to me that it is hardly worth repeating, we just need to get on with it."
"Water has a role to play in a Europe without borders, not only oil, gas and electricity, the trans-European networks that we already have."
"Why should water not play a similar role?"
"In any case, I believe that water can be classified as a product or a service under the EU Treaty, it certainly comes under the EU Treaty and is not excluded from normal goods."
"Mr President, there are parts of Europe where there is not enough water, and areas where there is sometimes too much."
"Other natural resources are similarly unequally distributed: forest, gravel, ores, oil, and so on."
"Would it be right to claim compensation for the unequal distribution of olive oil resources, for example?"
"This region we are in here is a pretty substantial non-olive oil producing region."
"Waterway systems have always caused radical change to the ecosystem."
"The reference to the canals of Provence and California was made without justification or critical examination."
"We could just as well mention the ecocatastrophe that the River Aral waterway system has caused."
"Before decisions are made in favour of one side or the other and measures taken, we should carry out a worldwide survey of the effects on ecosystems of waterways, canals and anything else connected, at the same time assessing their socio-economic and financial effects."
"In the case of Europe the matter is complicated by the fact that the effects are common to more than one Member State."
"There has been plenty of experience of these for a long time now, but hardly any analytical work has been carried out at all thoroughly."
"The survey should be undertaken by an independent study group or consultant."
"Rights of ownership to land and water differ dramatically from one country to another."
"There are countries where ground water belongs to the territory in which it is found, and is thus totally privately owned."
"It is not right that the EU should interfere in individual nations' laws of ownership."
"A positive feature of the resolution is the mention of the creation of a water market."
"This must be made much more of in our efforts to reach a stage where everything will happen within the framework of a free market."
"Spain's tourists are drawn by its waters."
"In any case an inventory of water reserves should be drawn up and these reserves must be protected through EU directives. We must, above all, respect national law."
"Mr President, Mr Linkohr, who spoke just now, asked why we should not consider trade in water, and added that water is after all just an economic commodity."
"He seemed somewhat surprised at the excitement this subject arouses in countries with abundant water."
"I am from Austria, and there is great excitement in my country about this, so perhaps I can help him a little here."
"Many people in Europe think that every problem can be dealt with by treating it as a commodity."
"Everything that there is a demand for is a commodity."
"They treat cloning this way, and book price maintenance in Germany - everything is a product and you can consider everything in that light."
"My question is, how do we consider things?"
"Why do we not think about the causes of water shortage?"
"Why do we not think about a European strategy for European water legislation, a legal, political and technological strategy for sorting out water management problems, for water conservation and reutilization?"
"Why do people not worry about the mistakes made in agriculture and the single crop farming methods that are contributing to this water shortage?"
"I think that the confidence of people in these water-rich countries is important. It is vital that politicians recognize the value of this commodity, Mr Linkohr, that they should have some notion, for example, of the contribution Austria's centuries-old water laws have made to giving my country its present level and quality of water reserves."
"But no-one is suggesting doing anything like this at European level."
"Instead, wherever and for whatever reason there is a water shortage or water quality is inadequate, we envisage simply bringing in water by pipeline from places where it is still available, and imagine that we will have solved the problem in that way."
"That breeds mistrust, and that is the reason for the excitement we have seen, and we need to have a complete rethink if water is not only to be treated as a commodity, but if people are also to be aware of its value."
"Mr President, I can of course understand the problems of countries who have managed their water differently, and where it is now a commodity in short supply."
"But whenever we come across logistical and structural problems it seems we try to solve them by interfering with nature on a gigantic scale."
"That has to be wrong, it cannot work in the long run."
"Before we consider major pipeline systems, we should consider how water supplies can be provided on the spot."
"We should call for urgent studies into the effect of microclimates and the effect of vegetation adjacent to water reserves."
"I am very much of the opinion that not only can we influence rainfall, but that we are already influencing it through our actions."
"I think that there is enormous scope for doing very positive things with our water resources, including in countries where there are problems at present."
"I believe that this debate should make us think about specific measures to solve these problems."
"These measures should not consist of setting up yet another network and expecting spurious solutions to solve real problems."
"We cannot therefore support this report now."
"However, we would like to be constructive and stress that we regard this debate as an opportunity for considering decentralized water management structures, and for investing money in them, because every ECU invested in that way will have an enormous medium and long-term benefit, I am quite convinced of that."
"Mr President, you will have realized that this report has provoked a debate on a very Austrian subject. I would have been very grateful if the Member from the Austrian Freedom Party who spoke before me had used the same words that he used in Austria in connection with this report, namely that there is a water war in the EU at present."
"In that light the whole picture looks quite different, and it is a very long way from the constructive approach that we are accustomed to working towards or appearing to work towards in this House."
"We do not doubt the quality of this report."
"We know that there is no question of making new EU law in this field."
"We also know what our rapporteur has referred to - point 18 in the report stipulates that there can be no transfer of water within the Union without the express permission of the Member States."
"That means that the European Treaties come into play, and in view of that I think we will have relatively few problems."
"Even if this report seems a bit fishy to me, a fish with a very Spanish flavour, I do welcome the fact, as a number of earlier speakers have mentioned, including both Mr Linkohr and Mr Voggenhuber, that once again we in Parliament are dealing with one of the most important commodities, namely water."
"One of our conservative friends has also quite rightly pointed out that there are undeniably ways of using and distributing water more efficiently in the southern countries."
"But we need to be aware that the bill for clean water in the future will be a very hefty one."
"In dealing with water management problems, we need to bear in mind that we may be talking about new policies, such as a new agricultural policy, as the present one takes no account of water at all, or, for instance, transport policy, which also fails to address water as an issue."
"Mr President, I fully accept the need for bilateral agreements in this area, and I wish Spain and France well."
"I am also very grateful to the Members in my delegation, and above all to Mrs GrosstÃªte, for agreeing to an amendment to which I attach great importance, as it makes it perfectly clear that any interference with a Member State's water without its express permission is completely ruled out."
"We can only give our support if this amendment is accepted."
"I understand that all Member States already have very strict and precise internal regulations governing who may access water and how, so surely this is even more important when it comes to bilateral relations."
"I would like to say a few words about those states that have their eye on their neighbours' water: do they really manage their own water carefully?"
"How do industry, factories and households behave?"
"Untreated water is discharged into our rivers and lakes in an appalling, dirty and dangerous state."
"That is unacceptable."
"It is everyone's duty to keep their own ground water reserves clean in the first place, and only then do they have a moral right to even consider looking at their neighbours' water!"
"I believe that we can only think about trans-European water networks when every country manages its own water with the utmost care."
"One thing has to be clear: with the greatest respect, Mrs McNally, we do not want any wars because of water."
"So we need to consider rights of ownership very carefully here."
"Mr President, before long all the Austrians in the House will have said something on this subject, but we still have not said everything there is to be said."
"I would like to tell Mr BÃ¶sch that I am using exactly the same words to say in Austria what I have to say here, and this is not scaremongering. I am just expressing concern, despite having great sympathy for the problems of other Member States of the European Union."
"This report is based on the dangerous assumption that natural resources unevenly spread between the sovereign states of the European Union can be supra-nationally redistributed."
"Water is not a natural resource belonging to the European Union, as suggested in recital D, but rather a natural resource at the sole disposal of the people of those countries on whose territory it is found."
"We very firmly reject the notion that quantitative aspects of water policy can be treated as a priority European Union policy."
"Nevertheless, the report does address some ideas which could provide an appropriate approach to solving the problems of countries where water is in short supply, such as technical measures aimed at improving the poor condition of water pipelines, reforestation or desalination of sea water."
"Above all it is necessary to optimize existing local facilities, which would lead to a greater improvement in regions suffering from water shortages."
"But intervention by the Commission in quantitative aspects of water policy would run counter to the principle of subsidiarity, and create additional unnecessary supranational powers, which would inevitably result in tensions between Member States."
"Quantitative water policy is and must remain the sole preserve of sovereign states."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to say thank you for the initiative from the Committee."
"It reflects the citizens' ever growing interest in the question of water resources."
"It is not only about drinking water, but about water in general as a limited resource which must be protected by a joint effort."
"I can fully confirm what the rapporteur, Mr Collado, said about the fact that it made a great impression on all the Ministers when they visited Andalusia and experienced the great water shortage."
"Fortunately it may be said that later (I have just visited the DoÃ±ana area again) the region did get some water, so the situation is not as desperate as it was at that time."
"You will therefore understand that I place great emphasis on the questions of water management and the protection of water resources, and, as you know, in February and November 1997 the Commission approved a draft framework directive on water resources which will act as the central element of European water policy."
"It was in fact Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection which, together with other institutions, took the initiative for a change in European water policy with the symposium on water in June 1995."
"Very briefly, a few comments on the draft framework directive on water resources, because it is currently being discussed by both Parliament and the Council, and because it contains a number of significant innovations."
"Firstly, it will expand protection to cover all water resources and also promote sustainability in connection with the exploitation of these resources."
"Secondly, its objective will be to achieve a good status for all water resources."
"The means will be to combine limits for discharges with an objective for water quality."
"Where regions or Member States share hydrological networks, they will set their objectives jointly."
"Thirdly, there is the question of water volumes and the protection of water resources."
"That is also being considered."
"Water catchment shall be subject to a licensing procedure and an objective will be set to ensure that there is balance between water catchment and the natural renewal of water."
"Last, but not least, the framework directive on water will increase transparency and ensure the involvement of all affected citizens and parties when management plans or hydrological networks are being drawn up."
"That means that significant topics raised in the draft resolution have already been taken up in the draft framework directive on water resources."
"Let me give a few examples: protection of both water quality and water volumes, payment for water usage with full coverage of costs, assessment of existing facilities and their best possible use, increased transparency and involvement of citizens in water management."
"However, there are some questions raised in the draft resolution which Parliament's Committee on the Environment regarded with a certain degree of reservation, so to speak."
"That applies in particular to the interconnection of Europe's hydrological networks with the aid of artificial watercourses."
"The opinion of the Committee on the Environment, and I quote, ' insists that at present the European Union does not have the know-how or experience needed to establish such networks.'"
"I admit that I share the Committee on the Environment's scepticism on this point."
"The Commission is convinced that problems should first and foremost be tackled at source."
"That is why the draft framework Directive on water obliges Member States and regions to jointly seek to solve their water problems within shared hydrological systems, but does not aim for large-scale transfers of water between hydrological networks."
"At the moment, as several speakers also mentioned during the debate, the Member States and their regions show very different patterns of water-related problems and also very different strategies for solving them."
"In my view that is one of the reasons why the institutions, Member States and non-governmental organizations are agreed that there is a need for a new European water policy, and I share many of the opinions expressed during the debate that this will be one of the major issues in future."
"If, at this stage, the Community was obliged to set up a hydrological network, that would, in my opinion, not comply with the principles of sustainable development and of tackling environmental problems at source which are prescribed in the Treaty, and which are also one of the pillars of the proposed framework directive on water."
"In addition, and here I will again point to the Committee on the Environment's opinion, it is still too soon to start on a study which covers the whole of the Community."
"The necessary data will not exist until the framework directive on water resources has been adopted, and comparable objectives have been set."
"I feel there is support for this position in the opinion of the Committee on the Environment and in paragraph 8 of the draft resolution, which points to the possibilities of, and I quote, ' making the best use of existing facilities' and the fact that it is important 'to improve management before you invest.'"
"But the proposed framework directive would by no means prohibit such solutions in certain regions where people are clear about the data and assessments, respect the environmental objectives and have achieved agreement between the parties."
"During the development of a new European water policy, it has from the beginning been my intention as Commissioner for the Environment to consult with all interested and affected parties."
"When I now look back on this process of consultation, I must regard it as extraordinarily successful, both because we have had very valuable input, and because there has been general support for the view that there is need for a new water policy, and for the structure it has been given in the proposal."
"And it is also in that light that I see the very exciting debate which has taken place in Parliament this morning."
"I am convinced that the proposed framework directive for water resources will form a good basis for cooperation on sustainable water management between the EU institutions, the Member States and their regions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m."
"EC- Republic of Yemen cooperation agreement"
"The next item is the report by Mr Pettinari (A4-0007/98) on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Yemen."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, Yemen is a country which over the past few years has made a number of major strides towards democracy and economic reform and these deserve the support of the European Union."
"If we look at the political situation in the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen is setting a good example, admittedly with some contradictions, but one which requires a commitment from the European Union side by side with the authorities in San'a. To this end, I recommend that the economic and trade Cooperation Agreement which is the subject of my report be ratified."
"Since 1990 Yemen has been undergoing a process of reunification between the north and south of the country which has changed its geography and its politics."
"With the defeat of the secessionist forces in 1994, the country experienced an acceleration of the democratic process which has resulted in the organization of general free and democratic elections."
"A delegation from the European Parliament was even able to monitor the conduct of the elections and testify to the fairness of the electoral process."
"Today, Yemen has a parliament made up of 301 members in which the normal interaction between the majority and the opposition are bringing about a population with a maturing democratic awareness."
"To understand my favourable views properly, you have to consider carefully the regional context in which Yemen finds itself. In the Arabian Peninsula Yemen's democratic experience is probably the most advanced and has developed despite external obstacles and opposition, in particular from Saudi Arabia which, for obvious political and economic reasons, has always tried to place obstacles in the path of the development of democracy in Yemen."
"What is more, the foreign policy choices made by Yemen during the Gulf War did not help to create a climate in which the country would be accepted into the international community."
"Only now is it finding its proper role on the regional and international stage."
"In this context I should like to point out the country's constant and determined search for peaceful relations with its neighbouring countries."
"This is further evidence of the existence of a deliberate democratic choice which I believe we should be supporting: a global good neighbours treaty has been signed with Oman to put an end to long-standing territorial disputes in the east of Yemen; the International Court of Justice in the Hague has become directly involved in the dispute with Eritrea over the Hanish islands, using peaceful diplomacy to put an end to a situation which must not be allowed to wreck relations between two important countries needlessly; contact is even being reestablished with Saudi Arabia to resolve territorial disputes in northern Yemen."
"In my opinion, these are important, positive political choices to which the Union should give its backing."
"Admittedly, we all know only too well that Yemen still has a lot of problems."
"We only have to think of the unacceptable incidences of abduction which on more than one occasion have also involved tourists from my country."
"But Yemen is undergoing a process of change and the context in which this is happening must also be understood by its critics."
"In San'a I discussed face-to-face with the country's highest authorities the accusations of human rights violations which have also been voiced by Parliament, and I found they were open to dialogue and were prepared to provide all the explanations asked of them."
"Likewise, the Yemeni authorities are aware of the different approach in Europe to women's issues, which must not however be tackled by shutting the country out, but by fostering closer cultural and social relations which, even in Yemen, must lead to the necessary emancipation of women."
"I can testify personally to the existence of a sincere and proven desire for dialogue on the part of the Yemeni authorities who are actually asking for help with specific programmes to further improve human rights and conditions for women in Yemen."
"Finally, I believe that the approval of the agreement between the European Union and Yemen must be seen as an opportunity to bring about closer Euro-Arab political and economic relations in a region which is of fundamental importance to world security."
"The European Union has often neglected the Arab and Mediterranean world and, in light of the current difficulties being experienced by the Middle East peace process, we can appreciate how important it is to have well-established relations with the Arab world."
"Yemen is an active member of the Arab League, and the democratic experience which it is undergoing is all the more reason why it should become a political partner of the European Union."
"Because of its history and its economic structure, Yemen has a natural inclination towards a priority relationship with the European Union, an inclination which must be frustrated."
"In this regard, the economic and trade Cooperation Agreement which I am asking you to approve can only be a starting point for bringing about closer ties between this country and the European Union which, in my opinion, will be advantageous for Yemen and also for Europe."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank Mr Pettinari very sincerely for his report and to congratulate him on the conclusions he reaches in it."
"I know that he has been able to contribute a great deal through his personal knowledge of the situation in the Yemen."
"This means, and I must say this straight away, that I find it all the more sad that the Cooperation Agreement was signed back in September and that we are just going through the motions by giving our assent to the agreement, so that the input of Mr Pettinari and the other people who cooperated on the report will have no influence at all on the shape of the agreement."
"In this context I think it is particularly important that the agreement includes a future development clause."
"This means that the agreement is simply a basis that can be built upon in the future."
"Although the agreement is far more broadly based than the one drawn up in 1984, it is nevertheless important that this is just a basis."
"It is good that this agreement covers the extensions of tourism and the modernization and restructuring of the agriculture and fisheries sectors, because these are all signs that things have changed enormously in the Yemen in recent years."
"We must remember what has been achieved there in just a few years: a country that was once a training centre for terrorists, and which used to be a channel for money destined for international terrorism, has in a few years achieved an incredible process of internal transformation and restructuring, which is of course associated with the reunification of the two parts of the country."
"It is logical that the Yemeni people should look to us for clear signs that we intend to offer them support and for suggestions as to how this relationship between the European Union and the Yemen can be developed further in the future."
"Mr President, I also want to congratulate Mr Pettinari on his report."
"My colleagues from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and myself welcomed the particular agreement with the Republic of Yemen in December."
"We all know, and it has been said already, that the Yemen has made great progress recently in democratization and in respect for basic human rights."
"The support we are offering today is essential."
"Even though it is late it is important that this Parliament should extend this support if the Union is to see itself as a genuine buttress of fundamental human rights and the freedoms which we espouse worldwide."
"It provides an example and a message to other countries in the region which have very inferior human rights records and no respect for democratic methods."
"Universal suffrage in elections to the Yemeni Parliament is especially praiseworthy in the context of the all-male electorates in neighbouring states in the region."
"I was one of Parliament's observers at the elections there last year."
"There were shortcomings but our observations were that they were free and fair elections, despite the fact that there were segregated polling stations, and I was dismayed to see that there were separate counts taking place for women voters."
"There was also a problem in that we were unable to visit certain areas for security reasons."
"A number of other problems remain and some of them have already been alluded to."
"For example, the death penalty."
"Although it has not been implemented for several years, it remains in the Yemeni penal code."
"Existing minimum wage and child labour provisions should be enforced and improved."
"Literacy rates need to be improved, especially in the context of the elections where literacy was a huge problem."
"Action must be taken against the continued practice of female genital mutilation."
"Various NGOs from inside and outside the Republic of Yemen approached me and my colleagues from time to time with criticism about certain corrupt practices and inefficiencies in the judicial system, about individual human rights abuses sometimes perpetrated by the security forces, and the arbitrary imprisonment of many thousands without due process."
"These people are taken into prison without proper documentation or proper charges being made."
"So, there are those problems but by linking the human rights clause in this agreement and the non-execution clause we are provided with further leverage in pressing for observance of these rights."
"Finally, despite the problems therefore, I welcome the very positive approach taken by the rapporteur."
"I am sure that the benefits of cooperation will encourage further cooperation and democratization."
"I consider that Parliament must continue to press for ratification by the Yemen of important international human rights conventions and continue to take up individual cases of human rights abuses as they are presented to us."
"The Yemeni Government is listening to us and is taking note of what Parliament says."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Pettinari on his report and, like Mr Habsburg-Lothringen, I regret that we are only debating this now after the ink has dried."
"Yemen is an interesting country in that it is one of the world's divided countries and a country which is now trying to overcome the problems of division."
"Indeed, the reunification process has not been without its setbacks and difficulties in the Yemen."
"The agreement we are discussing today is the culmination of valuable cooperation between the EU and Yemen, dating back as far as 1979, as support given to Yemen for economic and development projects totalling ECU 58 million has gradually put the country into an economic and strategic position which suggests that further positive developments are guaranteed."
"I believe that another aspect of this positive situation, which Mrs Malone has already described, is the prevailing pluralistic democracy, which seems to be on the right path, despite the criticisms she mentioned, not to mention the cautious economic policy aimed at avoiding social dislocation."
"But I am sure that the whole thing will only become stable once the commitments of nearly ECU 2 billion made by last year's conference of donor countries become a reality, and soon."
"This agreement will round off, so to speak, the various agreements in the Mediterranean area."
"I also believe that Yemen will take this opportunity to prove to us that religious traditions and respect for human rights can certainly be combined."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on the Pettinari report on the Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Yemen highlights three broad reasons which largely correspond to the areas of political, economic and human activity."
"In the political arena, three main elements should be noted: firstly, the unification of Yemen and the attempts to reduce the internal splits between the north and the south;"
"Secondly, also in this area, the democratic character of the regime indicated by the elections on 27 April 1997 which has continued ever since; and finally, the third political reason is the mandatory encouragement by the European Union in this area of personal and collective responsibility."
"At an economic level, we have noted the implementation of progressive reforms which seek to avoid internal clashes in an economic context which remains difficult."
"Secondly, in this domain, combined economic policies are being sought and implemented."
"Finally one last point on the economic front, there are attempts to promote balanced trading; at present there is an imbalance generally in favour of the Union which must allow Yemen to sell its original products better."
"Lastly, at a human level, we are taking into account, as necessary, the needs of the Yemeni people; they are extremely poor in comparison to us, and the emphasis is being placed on education and technical assistance, as well as the mandatory continuation of aid which contributes to the improvement of local rural development and the standard of living of the most disadvantaged people."
"The combination of these reasons leads us to conclude that total cooperation is essential, and the UPE group will vote for Mr Pettinari's report on the Cooperation Agreement between the Union and the Republic of Yemen."
"Mr President, the Republic of Yemen deserves a prize for effort."
"The Liberal group will therefore wholeheartedly agree with the Cooperation Agreement between Yemen and the Union."
"The new agreement is an important adjustment of the agreement of 1984."
"This adjustment reflects the altered reality in Yemen."
"Whilst the agreement of 1984, as everyone knows, was signed with North Yemen, the new agreement applies to the reunited country."
"The unification of 1990 laid the foundation for harmonious development in the country."
"The riot threat in 1994, thankfully, strengthened the country."
"The report shows that politicians are at last convinced of the need for democracy and human rights."
"Yemen occupies an exemplary position within the region."
"This is often forgotten, as the region is chiefly dominated by Saudi Arabia in a positive sense, it is said, and by Iraq in a negative sense."
"Foreign policy is directed at solving all disputes with neighbouring countries."
"Multi-party democracy works and the parliament is elected unanimously."
"The April parliamentary elections definitely deserve more than the benefit of the doubt."
"In the sphere of economics, too, things are put right in conjunction with the IMF."
"But we must obviously remain vigilant about the future."
"Yemen is an extremely poor country in which democracy is still showing considerable gaps."
"That is why we wholeheartedly support the signing of this agreement which should contribute to the intensification of contacts with Yemen."
"The agreement should, on the one hand, be used to develop its economy and trade between the Union and Yemen."
"On the other hand, much attention must be paid to improvements in the legal and the voting systems and in public administration."
"Further strengthening of democracy must remain an important focal point."
"The Yemeni government must make efforts to engender respect for human rights, to combat corruption, and to obtain further guarantees for press freedom."
"This Cooperation Agreement is a prize for effort, as I have already said, and the government of Yemen deserves support for the reforms, and a boost for further activities in this direction."
"The Union must seize this agreement, and intensify and diversify its efforts in the region."
"We should not merely focus on Saudi Arabia, but also on other countries, Yemen in particular."
"I would like to thank Mr Pettinari and to voice my respect for his excellent report."
"I expected no less from him."
"Mr President, for many years prior to the unification of North and South Yemen in 1990, development was held back by border wars between the two states and bitter internal struggles which periodically flared into civil war."
"Sadly, even since unification, Yemen has been the victim of the civil war of April to June 1994."
"Hopefully it will be possible to avoid any recurrence of such events and the country will be able to achieve an improved level of economic growth in future. This could provide the means of raising living standards for all Yemeni citizens, but in particular those living in poverty, deprivation and squalor, provided that this is not just left primarily to free market forces."
"With this in view we should welcome the cooperation agreement before us today."
"It could make an important contribution to Yemen's forward march."
"This will also, however, require real improvement in the area of human rights."
"Last year this House approved a resolution which drew attention to serious human rights abuses, despite the fact that Yemen has agreed to some human rights conventions and incorporated them into its laws."
"Since April there have been numerous arrests although many of those arrested on unjustifiable grounds have now been released."
"One of the problems is that political security acts in a totally arbitrary manner and is responsible only to the President."
"There are also Draconic punishments in the penal code of 1994."
"Women's rights are restricted although the situation is much better than in some other Arab states."
"This House should support the agreement but demand that the human rights situation is kept under close attention."
"Hopefully even those accused of participation in the 1994 civil war will be amnestied since this would be a vital step to national reconciliation."
"On this basis I support the report and the agreement."
"Mr President, the new Cooperation Agreement concluded between the European Community and the Republic of Yemen has to be analysed within its historical context."
"The unification of Yemen was supported by a majority of the population in both states, but the new government had to face the obstacles of national reconciliation and the considerable economic deficit created by the civil war."
"As you know, Yemen has successfully tackled these challenges."
"Today, Yemen is a single country, a unified country, and the government is doing all it can to reconcile public opinion in the south, although certain elements both inside and outside Yemen continue to offer opposition."
"A united Yemen represents an important keystone, and the European Union fully supports it."
"We consider that the process of democratization in Yemen is irreversible."
"The country held democratic general elections in 1993, followed by a second election last year."
"As Mrs Malone said, the international observers generally felt that both elections were fair and free, irrespective of whether certain shortcomings may have been detected."
"The democratic process is still young and will need help, and I want to stress that the European Commission lent its support to governmental and non-governmental organizations during both elections, and is programming more aid in order to strengthen this young democracy."
"The Yemeni government has not only begun the process of transforming a strictly state-controlled economy into a free-market economy, but is also carrying out important reforms within a framework already agreed with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank."
"In fact, during a meeting in Brussels in June 1997, a sum of ECU 1 300 million over three years was promised for this operation, and the international donors expressed their support for and appreciation of the government's efforts."
"While these positive changes were taking place, the Yemeni government over the last decade has been exploring the possibility of establishing new, broader, modernized cooperation relations with the European Union."
"The new agreement was modelled on the Community's cooperation agreements with developing countries, and in February 1997 the Council approved the negotiation guidelines proposed by the Commission. Then, on 25 November, the agreement was signed."
"I believe this agreement can make a considerable contribution to the processes of modernization and economic development to which the Republic of Yemen has committed itself."
"The agreement includes the promotion of the private sector and the establishment of permanent economic dialogue in various sectors."
"Furthermore, as several speakers have already said, this agreement includes the normal clause on respect for democracy and human rights as a basic principle of our cooperation."
"And in that respect, Mr President, I want to emphasize that the Yemeni government has accepted that obligation fully and unreservedly."
"I want to thank the Committee on Development and Cooperation, the Committee on External Economic Relations and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy for having realized the importance of this agreement (as does the European Commission), for having shown it this support, and for supporting it with a favourable vote."
"Mr Commissioner, thank you for your speech."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a few minutes."
"Votes"
"Mr President, yesterday during the debate on this subject, it became clear that a large majority of the groups are thinking along the same lines."
"The various resolutions originally submitted by different groups were also a clear indication of this."
"Unfortunately, a majority of the groups decided to withdraw their resolutions, and we know that due to lack of flexibility the groups were no longer able to support our resolution, despite the fact that they largely agree with us on content."
"We would find it incredible if this Parliament were to vote in a majority vote against something with which it actually agrees in principle."
"That is why we are withdrawing our resolution."
"But we do say very clearly that even though it is human, it is not very elegant, Mr President."
"The resolution is withdrawn."
"The conciliation which is the basis of the present report had reached a number of acceptable compromises with the demands of the European Parliament concerning the concept of affordable price, the cost of universal service, consumer protection and service quality, protection of disabled users and number portability."
"We can, therefore, support this report."
"It remains to be said, however, that a satisfactory state of the Open Network Provisions is one necessary condition of the liberalization of Telecom markets, and that, without strong intervention from parliament, they would have remained quite below the necessary standards of regulation."
"It would be useful, indeed, if the Commission and Council would prepare further action in related fields with more care and with considerably more attention to the concomitant necessities of regulation."
"Pack report (A4-0012/98)"
"In 1994-1995 we held long and difficult negotiations to establish the grant for the Socrates programme."
"The European Parliament played an important role in fixing the financial package at the reasonable level of ECU 850 million and in adding a clause for the review of funds at the half-way stage."
"The Socrates programme has now shown its mettle."
"The promotion of education throughout life has been organized around this unique programme which operates from pre-school age up to the third level of university education."
"Thanks to its vast range of activities, the opportunities offered to young people and to teachers have been increased tenfold, with the consequence that a real sense of European identity has developed."
"Positive results recognized by everyone have been achieved by a large number of the 119 million people under 25 and the 4 million teachers."
"The enormous popularity for the European educational community must not be compromised two years before the end of the programme when eleven new countries are knocking at the door of the European Union and offering the opportunity for mutual enrichment."
"We need the appropriate finance and we must widen the programme as far as possible, taking into account the latest technological developments, particularly in the area of information."
"I am therefore in favour of the Pack report and the increase in financing, to the tune of ECU 70 million, for 1998 and 1999, which he stipulates for the Socrates programme."
"Like most of my colleagues, I only regret that the final compromise could not have been made on the basis of the additional 100 m proposed last June by the European Parliament."
"Education and training have become the most important factor in the economic and social future of Europe."
"Acting to promote exchanges of students and ideas also promotes Europe and the single currency, and economic and monetary union."
"Let us not forget this when deciding on the budget."
"If there is one area which unites our Parliament in stressing its importance, it is education, and more specifically mobility within education."
"Mrs Pack and others have rightly highlighted that the Socrates programme is a fundamental instrument for young Europeans, both for their education and for adding a 'European' approach to their studies, and, more generally for a more open approach to others."
"The programme even represents a point of reference for individuals who often only know about the actions of the Community through things which affect their own world or that of their children."
"This is why I am voting for this report and for the budgetary increase finally decided upon by the Council of Ministers, not for Education but for Finance!!!"
"We should note carefully the irony of Finance Ministers making cuts first of all in the education and culture sectors!"
"We can only hope that this historic decision is reproduced in other areas and that it can put an end to the general hypocrisy of the speeches."
"The Council and Parliament have reached agreement on earmarking an additional sum of ECU 70 million for the Socrates training programme so it comes up to ECU 920 million."
"In today's Europe it is important to invest in the exchange of young people, which is why the Socrates training programme is a sensible measure."
"It provides an opportunity for young people from the whole of Europe to be able to train in other countries and to meet other young people from the rest of Europe."
"I therefore give the report my full support."
"Socrates is a classic case of the advantages of Community intervention."
"The only lucid policy decision must be to strengthen this scheme for student and teacher exchanges at all levels of education."
"Despite this evidence, however, Member States have hesitated for a long time before granting the necessary financial means to make it possible to do something they themselves had decided on: the extension of the scheme to countries that are applying to join the Union."
"The Commission proposed a 50 % increase, Parliament asked for 100 % and the Council decided on 25 %."
"For that reason the compromise solution was surprising, because in settling it at 70 % the Council finally decided in favour of a bigger increase than the Commission itself had suggested."
"How are to we account for this unusual outcome?"
"It is due to two important factors: the agreement between the Committee on Culture and the Committee on the Budgets, who made common cause and brought it into the 1998 Budget; and the committed and well-informed work of one Member, who has not shrunk from bringing direct pressure to bear on governments and stirring up public opinion."
"Politics needs passionate personal involvement and well-directed diplomatic activity."
"I am therefore delighted to vote for this significant report."
"Read report (A4-0023/98) and the CamisÃ³n Asensio report (A4-0027/98)"
"The Commission has drawn up a draft directive on telecommunications equipment which is to replace two Council Directives on telecommunications terminal equipment and ground station equipment in connection with satellites."
"In addition, the Commission is recommending increasing the scope of the Directive so that radio communications equipment is also covered by the rules."
"However, it is vital to allow for the fact that radio amateurs, who build their own transmission equipment, have no chance of living up to the tough demands for technical standards required by the directive."
"But nor is this necessary, because amateur equipment is not intended for sale."
"In the light of the fact that I, as protector of the Danish radio amateurs, have received a guarantee from the Commission that the radio amateurs' equipment is not covered by the directive, I give the report my full support."
"Recommendation for 2nd reading by Mr Lehne (A4-0005/98)"
"I should like to comment briefly that this report, especially in view of the present financial crisis in Asia, which is essentially attributable to private debts, is broadly linked to the issue of banking supervision, the coordination and harmonization of which is a matter of urgency in the context of the internal market and the single currency."
"This is relevant to the Lehne report given that, especially in relation to Amendment No 2, it may well be asked to what extent the 'duty of supervision or approval' to be imposed by Member States in turn requires a European framework system."
"This is, however, no reason to vote against the report, which is itself uncontentious."
"Recommendation for second reading by Mr Parodi (A4-0411/97)"
"The Commission has proposed to update Directive 94/58/EEC, based on the international STCW Convention on the training conditions of seafarers."
"At our first reading in May last year, we asked the Council to take into consideration 35 amendments aimed at strengthening the original proposal."
"Of these amendments, we are delighted to note that 20 were approved by the Community executive."
"Our work involved supplying proposals relating to the training of seafarers."
"How can we not take into account the human factor in accidents at sea (80 % of these accidents are due to human error)."
"I welcome the proposal of my colleague which calls for the creation of a European institute of training."
"Seafarers in the European Union are highly qualified as a result of their training; we must extend, preserve and communicate this knowledge."
"Our maritime industry which uses this workforce can only become more competitive as a result."
"In conclusion, I think about the thousands of young people who aspire to the noble occupation of seafarer."
"We must offer them the prospect of serious training."
"Our colleague's proposal is a step in the right direction."
"White report (A4-0010/98)"
"We must get rid of the idea that when something is not going too well in the Member States, it is high time for Europe to step in."
"Of course I recognize that the living conditions of many animals in zoos are very poor."
"I support the position which Ms McKenna recently took, namely that a zoo is a totally unsuitable place for large numbers of animals."
"But that is another subject. Mr White's report is about whether you should make European-wide regulations for zoos."
"I categorically believe not, which is why I voted against the report."
"The fact is that the arguments for European legislation on zoos are not very strong."
"This is one of the topics on which the European Union has overstretched itself."
"Quite rightly, the Council in Edinburgh blew the whistle on the Commission. But in his report Mr White wants to return to the pre-Edinburgh stage: he wants a directive, not a recommendation, and he wants a directive based on legal basis 100A and 130S to boot."
"The other day I gave this example to a group of Dutch members of local authorities who were visiting."
"They soon agreed that this is an issue Brussels has nothing to do with."
"And these people were not even my own grassroots supporters!"
"From a legal point of view the European Parliament occupies an equally weak position."
"According to the subsidiarity principle, the Union has no authority in this area, and should therefore not act in this case."
"The discussion about the legal instrument is therefore completely superfluous."
"At best we can ponder whether or not to make a recommendation."
"In view of the seriousness of the situation in many zoos, it seems to me that a recommendation would be in order."
"The Commission's comprehensive draft recommendation (almost a directive) is quite sufficient."
"The Member States and the zoos have their hands full with this, leaving aside the cost implications."
"I do not doubt their good intentions, but a directive would be too much of a good thing."
"The new protocol on the wellbeing of animals which is included in the Treaty of Amsterdam commits the Community and its Member States to bear that requirement in mind, while it also invalidates the decision on the incorrect application of the principle of subsidiarity in this matter."
"Everybody knows that as far as wellbeing is concerned, the circumstances of animals in zoos are far from adequate. Such circumstances are not even guaranteed sufficiently in Member States' own legislation."
"Nor is it a simple matter to provide an appropriate environment for many animals, such as killer whales, dolphins, bears, etc. It is also important to bear in mind the suffering and change of habits imposed on the various species by this captivity, which is of a clearly commercial nature."
"At the time, I expressed these same sentiments with respect to the report prepared by Mr Scott-Hopkins, whom I had the honour of accompanying on a visit to Madrid zoo. Today I will of course support everything that Mr White says, because a recommendation alone, as the Commission knows very well, will not solve anything, and what we need is a solution to this problem."
"Since this is an urgent matter, I agree with the rapporteur that only a directive is capable of making sure that animals in captivity in the European Union's zoos get the protection they deserve, if the Commission also matches deeds with words and thereby fulfils the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"We have chosen to abstain in the final vote on the report."
"We do not think that the EU should draw up detailed legislation in all areas."
"We therefore reject the Committee's proposal for a change in the legal basis and the formulation as a directive."
"However, we do think it is worthwhile to have extensive cooperation on issues of animal protection."
"It would be best, however, if this cooperation were formulated through recommendations and conventions at a pan-European level."
"Today the Danish Social Democrats voted in favour of having a directive on the keeping of wild animals in zoos instead of the position which was recommended by the Commission, because we believe it is important to have proper rules throughout the EU."
"Zoos are either private or publicly owned and the standards can vary greatly."
"Properly run zoos fulfil many functions, such as scientific research, education and the preservation of species."
"Zoos which are only run for profit should be watched closely. There are far too many examples of zoos where the animals suffer, and there is very good reason to check that the international conventions on the keeping of and trading in wild animals, which the EU is a party to, are fully respected."
"That is why we are in favour of rules and support the report, even though we know well that there are many who will champion respect for the principle of subsidiarity and say that the EU has no power in this matter."
"We would like to see it put to the test."
"The trade in or exchange of endangered or vulnerable species is governed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora."
"Zoos are allowed to import, export or exchange any animal in connection with work on the preservation of species."
"EU rules in this area could help to check that the international agreements are upheld."
"The fact that there is a set of guidelines intended to systematize and harmonize the legislative framework of the various States regarding the keeping of wild animals in zoological gardens is of course a positive step."
"Positive as it is, it is equally true that we have been expecting that legislative framework to produce actual laws for some years now, but that action has been delayed a number of times for various reasons."
"The report essentially attempts to alter the guideline framework suggested by the Council, by turning it into a directive, with the backing of a wide consensus of opinion among the many associations and organizations in the European Union which work for the preservation and protection of animals."
"The report deserves our support, although it might have gone further."
"The fact is that it could and should also have covered permanent private collections, even those to which the public are not allowed to have access, since the conditions in which animals are kept ought to be uniform and universal."
"Similarly, it might have dealt with aspects relating to educational and teaching elements, in order to discourage the keeping of wild animals outside their habitat. This aspect should also have been taken into account in the actual licensing of new public and private exhibitions."
"I hope our vote in favour will help make it possible to make good the deficiencies and improve the text as soon as the opportunity arises to revise it."
"I am voting in favour of the White report on the keeping of wild animals in captivity, since it is time we put an end to the present free-for-all, with its suffering and lack of openness."
"Without wishing to question the love of animals shown by the owners and managers of many small zoos, it is obvious that many of these places do not comply with minimum conditions and that the veterinary services available are not of the technically specialized type needed for 'exotic' species of animals."
"What the European Parliament now demands, and is reinforcing by voting on this report in part-session, is that compulsory standards should be introduced throughout the territory of the Union - including during transport - and that means of ensuring supervision, openness and animal welfare should be strengthened."
"All proposals which improve the living conditions of animals in general and in zoos in particular are worth supporting."
"We are basically in favour of the proposals contained in the White report."
"However, we think that this is a matter which should be regulated by the individual Member States because of the principle of subsidiarity."
"The intention of this report is very proper."
"However, I think this is a matter for the Member States."
"Democracy and national self-determination are an overriding principle."
"You cannot justify restrictions on democracy by the fact that it serves a good cause."
"Therefore, I have voted against the report's proposal (Amendment No 1) that there should be a directive in this area."
"Recommendation on racism (B4-0108/98)"
"We voted for the resolution to show our abhorrence of racism, but we cannot support the wording in favour of Greater Union."
"The motion for a resolution by Mr Mohamed Ali deals with a serious subject: racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism."
"As a secondary subject he has also added the results of the European Year Against Racism, which would seem to be on a different level."
"A theme of this type warrants a clear and rigorous elaboration of the moral options and a serious approach in the exposition of the facts and ideas."
"The text proposed to us hardly meets these requirements."
"There is no mention of the moral and spiritual foundations for absolute rejection of racism: the equal dignity of every human being from his or her conception until his or her natural death, regardless of race, social condition - be it high or low -, religion, state of health or age."
"The omission of these founding principles weakens the impact of the resolution."
"Furthermore, the text mixes up proposals to which one could not subscribe, for example, the call for exemplary behaviour from teachers, with inadmissible ideological proposals, such as the idea of 'positive discrimination' , which obviously runs counter to the fight against discrimination."
"Moreover, the rapporteur mixes up notions which have nothing to do with one another, such as racism and nationalism."
"He plays with dangerous notions such as the detection of possible racist, xenophobic or nationalist tendencies which could pave the way towards an implausible inquisition of thoughts."
"Certain considerations are obscure, for example, factor H which either expresses an obvious fact, or involves some incomprehensible ulterior motives."
"Lastly, he refers to the Amsterdam Treaty, which, for the time being, is not part of the legal order of the Community since it has not been ratified by any of the Member States."
"For these reasons, we were unable to vote for the resolution."
"It will come as no surprise that, as a socialist and Frenchman, I support without reserve the questions and inquiries of our colleague, Mr Ali."
"I warmly congratulate him for them!"
"I would add my voice to his in the questions relating to the intentions of the Commission on possible demonstrations linked to the European Year against Racism and on putting in place the European Observatory against Racism."
"These are fundamental questions."
"I would add that they are not politically neutral questions; they are linked largely to the misery which affects an increasing number of our fellow citizens, which is no justification for them."
"I believe that under no circumstances can we excuse this minority of Europeans who swear allegiance to the extreme right which is bogged down in xenophobia and highly reactionary nationalism - the situation is much too grave."
"I, too, would like to give a warning to the fringe of representatives upholding the right wing who think they can maintain their positions by forming alliances or by aligning themselves with the positions of the most extreme parties."
"I hope that they will never forget that they are playing into the hands of the extreme right and will not even recover the voters who have left them."
"History teaches us that all parties of the extreme right bear within them the seeds of violence, and this violence always gives rise to tragedy."
"This resurgence of hate in a majority of countries shows us that the 'demon' which our fathers and some of us fought against is not dead, and the best way to pay our respects to those to whom we owe our freedom... is to continue their fight."
"We have voted for the current resolution on racism."
"We fully support the resolution's basic spirit of anti-racism and humanism."
"In spite of this we have objections on three points:"
"1.We do not think the immigration policies of the Member States should be harmonized.2.We do not think that criminal issues, such as the criminalization of racist organizations, should be decided at EU level.3.We would like to stress that work on human rights takes place mainly within the framework of the Council of Europe and that the EU should not try to take over matters from this pan-European institution."
"Although the Members from the Austrian Freedom Party will vote for the motion for a resolution in the final vote, this does not signify that they accept the content of all the points."
"We reject a European Charter on the Rights of Immigrants just as we reject European harmonization of criminal law or the abolition of the principle of mutual criminal liability for certain criminal offences."
"Thors report (A4-0008/98)"
"The report highlights a number of deficiencies in relation to the observance of Community rules in individual Member States."
"It also describes the observance by individual Member States of international agreements entered into by the EU."
"The amount of EU rules is constantly growing."
"Earlier messages about fewer but better rules have got no further than words."
"The amount of EU rules makes the regulatory system difficult to comprehend and is a cause of problems with implementing and applying the rules in the Member States."
"Another reason may be that the rules which are not perceived as important or essential, or which are perceived as interfering, are not implemented or are implemented last."
"However, in principle, the proposal in the report is good, which is why I have voted for it."
"Izquierdo Collado Report (A4-0407/97)"
"I voted against the Izquierdo Collado report on trans-European hydrographic systems because, as I see it, by recommending a water policy based on transfers, it runs contrary to the sense and scope of the current discussions on the framework directive on water, and the water regulations existing in international law, particularly those contained in the Helsinki and Espoo Conventions, for the protection of states which share rivers."
"Apart from anything else, the exclusive option for water-transfer calls into question the European legislation on environmental impact itself."
"A water quantity policy, which is highly important in southern Europe, cannot be separated from the aspects of quality and solidarity; and, above all, in hydrographic basins covering several Member States, the achievement of compatibility of interests is the keystone of the policy to be adopted."
"This is an initial report."
"The European Parliament will soon have an opportunity to decide on the framework directive in the legislative process."
"I wanted, however, to be sure of emphasizing this warning from the outset, so that the differences will be noted at this stage."
"How could anybody refuse to vote for Mr Izquierdo Collado's report on trans-European hydrological networks?"
"Those of us who have experience of working on environmental matters know that all ambitious projects require the appropriate impact assessments, which are now unavoidable."
"Therefore, to use that as an argument for voting against this report makes no sense."
"The fact is that extensive areas of the Community suffer cycles of unbearable drought, and without water there can be no life, progress or solidarity."
"The water problem is not just qualitative but also quantitative. In fact, this problem has only one solution: transEuropean hydrological networks."
"It is in that spirit that my positive vote is a vote for solidarity."
"The Danish Social Democrats are following the voting list of the Group of the Party of European Socialists for the report by Mr Collado on the technical feasibility of transEuropean hydrological networks."
"But we would like to point out that people should be extremely wary of embarking on projects which are aimed at expanding these hydrological networks."
"It will always be necessary first to carry out a fundamental investigation of the concrete cases where such a project could be realized."
"First and foremost people should make sure that the problem cannot be solved by more appropriate management of existing resources."
"This should be understood broadly and should therefore include the consideration of possible conversion of agriculture and industrial production."
"Conversion of agriculture is necessary, for example, in cases where certain water-intensive crops are grown in an area which is troubled by drought, and where people also grow these crops far outside their natural season."
"That is an example of a wrong way of thinking, and it should be changed before people embark on alternative solutions to the problem of water shortages."
"It is certainly true that water resources are unequally distributed within the European Union, as are areas of fertile arable land, iron and coal deposits, the number of hours of sunshine as well as cold and snow."
"When Europe's climate and natural resources were created there was no thought of a European Union, which was perhaps fortunate."
"Think how monotonous Europe would have looked if the distribution had been equal everywhere."
"The Member States, their governments and taxpayers have, through greater or lesser efforts, taken care of resources and evened out differences in the awareness that long-term, ecologically-sustainable investments are worthwhile."
"The report proposes the creation of an institutional framework for trans-European hydrological networks, the aim of which shall be a more uniform distribution of water resources within the Union."
"The thought alone is absurd."
"A country's national resources are and should remain a national concern."
"Distribution and economic investments in a Member State or a region should be decided by the country's parliament and be paid for by the taxpayers."
"Of course, as always, cooperation, agreements and economic investments between two or more countries are positive."
"But decisions and measures should, as is customary, take place through intergovernmental agreements."
"The management of the Member States' natural resources is not an area of competence for the EU, unless the EU intends to become a state."
"This is one of the most important strategic issues for Europe."
"Water will be the fundamental resource of the 21st century."
"It will be at the heart of conflicts between countries suffering from drought and those which are still able to irrigate their crops."
"In other words, the issue at stake here is the very source of life."
"So how could we refuse this source of all riches to our neighbours, and particularly Spain where the hills of Murcia and now even Catalonia once more bear the marks of increasing desertification?"
"The Heurta de Valencia, the Tribunal 'de los Aguas' , or the inspired mastery of water in the Sierra Nevada taking it to the jewel of 'Granada' Spain's history could be summed up as a battle for water."
"And so, quite spontaneously, its neighbour, France, and in particular the region of Languedoc-Roussillon would like to help, bring aid, share and offer from its bounty."
"Look at the plentiful water resources of the RhÃ´ne! It is tempting to siphon some of it off towards the Ebro basin."
"And this is precisely the sense of the project for a trans-European water network, from which the LanguedocRoussillon project has come, transporting water from the RhÃ´ne over some 320 km to the Pyrenees, before flowing onwards towards Barcelona.."
"It is a huge undertaking, with investments of over FF 7 billion."
"It is a beautiful, grand and seductive project, but yet it harbours many dangers."
"There is the ecological danger for the miraculous Camargue region, where it is not yet known if there will be an increase in salinity levels when the pressure from the RhÃ´ne water mass is reduced."
"But there is also the danger of a casus belli in waiting, the day when France too is touched by drought and turns off the tap to Spain."
"Moreover, we are told that 'any schemes for water supplies like this would be 'irreversible'."
"They could not be challenged in the short or medium term!'"
"Tomorrow, France will have no choice but to go to war with Spain over water. The only alternative is to deprive our market gardeners, our tree-growers, our farmers and our people of Languedoc of the water which they need, but which has been given to others."
"In the name of the near future and of good relations with our neighbours, we would prefer to say no now."
"We must think of our own people before others, even if they are our brothers."
"That concludes Voting Time."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"The sitting was closed at 12.10 p.m."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 29 January 1998."
"On 30 January in Seville the terrorist organization ETA murdered another town councillor belonging to the Partido Popular , Alberto JimÃ©nez Becerril, and in this case they also murdered his wife, AscensiÃ³n GarcÃ­a. Similarly, the Northern Ireland peace process has come under attack once more through repeated terrorist acts against the people of Ulster."
"Even at the risk of repeating ourselves, I believe it is the duty of our Parliament to speak out in condemnation once more."
"All these acts of terrorism must produce the same clear, downright repugnance in us, the representatives of the people of Europe, just as they also provoke renewed interest in increasing antiterrorist cooperation within the Union."
"Terrorism, no matter what its political objectives, consists of nothing more than an extremely serious infringement of the right to live, which is the first and most important of all human rights."
"I have sent the appropriate telegrams of condolence and solidarity to the respective governments, acting in my capacity of interpreter of the sentiments of this House."
"I call on you now to join with me in a minute's silence as a tribute in memory of the victims"
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Tourism"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0040/98 by Mr De Luca, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Court of Auditors' Special Report No 3/96 on tourist policy and the promotion of tourism; -A4-0049/98 by Mrs Wemheuer, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Commission's conduct in respect of alleged fraud and irregularities in the tourism sector."
"Mr President, this particular fraud in the tourism sector has cast a very dark shadow not only over the tourism sector but over the whole of the European Union."
"We must condemn that fraud, there is no two ways about it, and condemn fraud wherever we find it."
"Fraud damages not just the tourism sector but the whole foundation of many of our institutions."
"So I want to make our condemnation crystal clear."
"However I also want to acknowledge the progress the tourism section has made over the last couple of years under its new Commissioner, Christos Papoutsis."
"Many of the improvements are due to him and the people working in that sector."
"We have therefore to balance the condemnation against the progress that has been made and move forward."
"Let us remember that tourism is one of the most important industries in the entire European Union and creates millions of jobs, in many, many countries around the European Union."
"So we need now to condemn what has gone on in the past but at the same time to move forward."
"We need to work with the Commission to boost the tourism industry."
"This has been, to some extent, a Cinderella industry in the European Union for far too long and should be encouraged in order to create more jobs, more stability and more growth in our countries' economies."
"It is important that we move forward together for the benefit of all our citizens because jobs will be created by growth in the tourism sector."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Wemheuer on her devotion to her task of preparing the report she has presented to us today."
"I am taking the floor to stress that after the detailed debate we have been conducting within the Socialist Group, we found that the old issues of fraud associated with tourism, as our rapporteur herself mentioned in any case, have been dealt with by the Commission both with administrative changes and by recourse to the courts on the initiative of the Commission itself and the responsible Commissioner, Mr Papoutsis. The related decisions are forthcoming."
"We feel obliged to make that statement because the report does not just relate to tourism as its title suggests, but more generally to the issue of the essential transparency and prudent operation of the Commission's services."
"And those remarks concerning the Commission's modus operandi and the way the Commission cooperates with Parliament find us all in agreement, and we will certainly all contribute towards that direction."
"Mr President, this is a very old issue that has taken too long to come to this stage, and without the work of Mrs Wemheuer we would probably still be wandering around in the dark."
"Mr McMillan-Scott blew the whistle in 1989 about events then, and during the five years afterwards his reports were to some extent ignored and overlooked."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control's earlier report did not whitewash DG XXIII, but it really let them off the hook."
"There is no need to recall what was going wrong because all that is now admitted by the Commission, and I quote 'although most of the actions were completed or in progress before the present college took office, the Commission recognises that as an institution it is answerable for such actions in terms of information to the Parliament and measures to correct detected shortcomings."
"The Commission accepts that several aspects of the tourism programme could, and should, have been handled differently."
"It regrets that warning signs were not acted upon as rapidly as with hindsight they should have been."
"Lessons from the past have been learnt.'"
"I think the past is now the past."
"Of course, we have still got to deal with the recovery of some of the money which has not yet been got back by the Commission, and these things are being considered and dealt with by the police authorities in at least two countries."
"I want to stress to the Commission that the difficulties that we have had with them have been due to a mistaken loyalty to their predecessors."
"I think that loyalty was misplaced and has resulted in much of the delay."
"Mr De Luca is quite right in claiming that the result of this enquiry has brought the Commission and Parliament's Budgetary Control Committee closer together in addressing the various problems."
"DG XXIII has been overhauled, and the sound and efficient management brought in by Mr Liikanen will, I think, will prevent this kind of thing happening in other DirectoratesGeneral, so progress has been made."
"As two speakers have already said, the tourism policy has suffered and must be allowed to get under way."
"In summary, the Wemheuer and De Luca reports have vindicated two people completely."
"First of all, Mr McMillan-Scott himself whose sheer persistence and insistence have caused these investigations to be continued when they might otherwise have been dropped, and the investigative journalist has also been vindicated; his work has been very constructive in the work that we have been doing."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the face of the immense fraud problem which is becoming extremely worrying within the Union, a new strategy is gradually being drawn up under the impetus of the European Parliament."
"For many years, Parliament has spared no efforts in order to obtain increased means from the Council and the Commission."
"In order to fight this scourge and enable the Community to protect its financial interests better, these policies must not be diverted from their objective and the citizens of Europe must be given an assurance that public funds are well used, and used in the public interest."
"Mr De Luca's excellent report is an important contribution to understanding the factors which have led to fraud in the tourism sector and related areas."
"To deplore and condemn is not enough."
"Certainly, the Commission has been caught out in the management of one of its most significant internal policies, but the most important thing must be to analyse clearly the shortcomings which permitted such a torrent of irregularities in operations linked to tourism policy and to put in place constructive proposals to remedy it."
"This work has been done by Mr De Luca."
"Should we be surprised, scandalised, when we learn that, the way it was handled, tourism policy enabled the payment of aid to bodies having no right to accept it, that people not authorized to do so signed contracts and these contracts were received and accepted, that the identification of eligible expenses was never clearly established and that the real beneficiary of a grant or financing was not necessarily the beneficiary designated on the contract?"
"Such malfunctioning, such shortcomings are unacceptable!"
"In order to move forward, we must set out to identify the way in which the normal functioning of this policy has been compromised and the way in which it was possible for anomalies and irregularities to be conceived and developed to reach this climax which has so excited the media."
"To recognize the mistake is already one step towards making out the truth."
"What is important at the moment is that the Commission should be given the necessary means to put in place the remedies proposed by the De Luca report and by Parliament."
"To agree on a position is not enough: it must be converted into action."
"We expect significant actions which will demonstrate the determination of the senior officials of the Union."
"Mr President, what Mrs Wemheuer says is correct. Parliament will ask questions on this matter until we get an answer."
"I think that is a perfectly correct approach."
"That is the way we should exercise our supervision."
"SEM 2000 is not a good enough answer, even if good work is being done. Instead we must settle this question once and for all."
"I believe it is more worthwhile for us to actually concentrate more on investigating the whole procedure of exoneration than to try to find individual guilty parties to such an extent, as has happened."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there are other things in the report which cause concern, namely that we have perhaps not really seen clearly enough what we stand for, i.e. whether to continue to demand more supervision and more staff or to demand a more open and transparent administrative system generally."
"General openness is the best check on the Community's funds."
"I hope that is the route Parliament takes."
"For the rest, I must say that we should not draw the wrong conclusions and seek greater centralization of the process."
"That would be the wrong route to take."
"I also believe we should pay great attention to what role we are thinking of giving UCLAF."
"There are, you see, signs that this unit is becoming 'a little state within a state' and that its effectiveness is perhaps not as great as we might wish."
"I hope that in connection with this we also take the opportunity to create uniform rules for auditing generally within the Union, and more uniformity with regard to accounting legislation and what verification should be kept in future."
"Similarly, in other contexts we have touched on collection rules which are too unclear, and reclaiming."
"Finally, I hope that we will also learn a lesson from this procedure when we renew the service regulations for all the Union's staff."
"Mr President, we are now discussing matters which came about before Finland joined the EU, matters which do not concern us but countries in the EU that lie further south."
"I am not referring to any one specific country, as every country in the EU lies further south than Finland."
"It would appear from investigations carried out that there are colossal problems in the EU when it comes to monitoring."
"Administrative confusion is clearly peculiar to the European Union."
"This confusion does not only concern tourism, but, in our experience, agriculture and, for example, energy policy."
"Investigations show that the Commission is guilty of serious negligence."
"The Commission appears to have operated in a way reminiscent of the Belgian police."
"It is a serious issue when the Commission stands accused of responding negatively to investigation, that it holds back information from Parliament, and that illegalities have occurred which remain unexplained."
"And a basis for not discharging them from liability for 1996 will persist if the Commission fails to provide Parliament with the documentation requested."
"It amazes me that there are so many incompetent people working in the service of the Commission."
"I think that with the salaries they pay, the Commission should be able to get more capable staff."
"The rapporteurs have done a splendid job but, to my mind, have paid too little attention to negligence on the part of national monitoring bodies."
"There has been financial negligence both at the distribution and at the receipt end."
"I think if we are going to start hunting for robbers, we will be catching them at both ends."
"I would therefore hope that national authorities are aware of their responsibility and Parliament will send a clear message to them regarding how ineffectual their systems of supervision have proved."
"Mr President, Mrs Wemheuer writes in her report that 'ever since...1989...the European Commission has withheld relevant information from Parliament, and...the Court of Auditors, provided information only after unjustified delays and, at times, provided misleading information.'"
"Can things really be so bad in the Commission?"
"What is it the Commission is actually trying to hide?"
"It must be something, since otherwise it would not have acted in this way, i.e. trying to protect its own employees and trying to put the lid on publicity by shutting itself off."
"Openness in the EU system appears to be in a very poor shape. Clearly the Commission does not dare look the citizens in the eye and explain that 'this has gone wrong, we made a mistake here, but we tried to achieve this in this way.'"
"Such admissions from the Commission are very difficult to obtain."
"I would like to ask the members of the Commission who are here now whether it would not have been better to have proper publicity in the Commission?"
"As Mrs Thors said, the best supervisory body we have is publicity and transparency, of which we should have a great deal."
"This story has been going on for almost ten years."
"It would therefore be best if we made a clean breast of things now so that we do not continue going over this issue again and again."
"We in Parliament are not going to forget the questions we have asked."
"The European Parliament is only doing its duty as the EU's supervisory body."
"The Green Group in the European Parliament is going to support Mrs Wemheuer's report to the letter."
"As far as the Committee on Budgetary Control is concerned, we are not content simply to inspect and find mistakes."
"Instead we also draw up many constructive proposals as to how people can do better in future."
"I really hope that the Commission reads our report and tries to do its best in future."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating these two brave rapporteurs, who have set out all these fairly unpleasant facts so very clearly and without beating about the bush."
"I should also like to pay tribute to Mr McMillan-Scott, because I remember how, when this started in 1989, he was almost alone - but I always supported him - in seeking the truth of this fairly sordid matter, where pockets were lined and where the people who lined their pockets have not, as far as I know, paid anything back yet or been officially asked to do so."
"All of us know we have to go forward and that the present incumbents in office are not the people responsible for these depredations."
"We all know the importance of tourism."
"Tourism remains a sleeping giant to a great extent in the Member States."
"We know it can provide more jobs - mention was made of 100 million, but we know there can be still more with more inter-state cooperation and marketing and with longer seasons in some Member States."
"I speak with some feeling there, because I do not always offer the best weather in my particular part of the Community but it is very good for certain holidays."
"We do not want to knock our sleeping giant on the head."
"But that is a separate matter from trying to deal with the things that have been wrong in the past to ensure that they never happen again."
"That is the position of most of us."
"We feel there is still a lot of clearing-up to be done and that questions should be asked as to why the information was withheld or was misleading, and why the irregular practices were tolerated for years, due perhaps, as Mr Kellett-Bowman said, to an excess of loyalty."
"But when there are criminal or fraudulent acts, an excess of loyalty cannot be tolerated by any elected Member of Parliament."
"Is there going to be any attempt to recover the money by way of compensation?"
"Are the criminal proceedings in the two Member States mentioned time-barred or not?"
"I heard that was a possibility, so that is another avenue that may not be open to deal with this problem."
"I have not heard of suspensions, sackings or fining."
"Parliament has an interest to know whether that is going to happen."
"Discharge provides a very strong weapon for Parliament, but it is very difficult for the job to be done if the information is not before the Committee on Budgetary Control and Parliament."
"We really must be sure that we get the information before we grant the discharge in 1996."
"It has to be conditional until we get answers to all the questions raised here."
"Is there going to be agreement from the Commission for the future?"
"In paragraph 9, Mr De Luca calls on the Commission to submit within three months a progress report on the recovery of undue payments."
"Does the Commission agree with that?"
"Does the Commission agree that there must be total transparency from now on and that such practices should not be repeated even if loyalty is at stake?"
"These are the questions I would leave with the Commission."
"I hope we are going to get answers."
"Mr President, the issue of alleged fraud and irregularities in the tourism industry is one of the most worrying that the Committee on Budgetary Control has had to examine, because it comes close to a deliberate desire on the part of the Commission to avoid its responsibilities and to conceal from Parliament - an institution which, after all, represents the people of the European Union - the reality and gravity of the malfunctioning of DG XXIII."
"Must I remind you that the first suspicions of fraud were expressed in 1989?"
"Since that date, reports, internal audits and special reports concluding that there were serious administrative weaknesses and flagrant irregularities have followed one after the other."
"So the Commission has clearly followed a policy of obstruction in order to avoid the scandal being made public and Parliament being fully informed."
"How do you explain that the head of the ""Tourism' Unit has had to explain his activities only five years after the most senior people within the Commission were informed?"
"Unfortunately other affairs which the Committee on Budgetary Control has been made aware of show that these events are in no way isolated phenomena."
"This is a worrying sign that the Commission is too often a deficient administration, stricken with fraud, irregularities, even corruption."
"The Commission must not longer act as if it were a state within a state, to use a French expression, or like an extra state of the European Union, as someone said earlier, which is subjected to no political control, be it internal or from Parliament."
"The De Luca and Wemheuer reports represent a courageous stance."
"The 1996 acquittal is from now on conditional on the responses that the Commission will give to these two reports."
"Our Parliament must remind the Commission that an attitude which consists of avoiding the truth will seriously damage the Union's image, as well as our Parliament's reputation, as we would from end up appearing inefficient and useless."
"Mr President, if the so-called tourism affair has become a touchstone for the Commission, then the European institutions, with the European Parliament at their head, must do everything possible to ensure that this scandal does not cause the collapse of the EU's tourism policy."
"The rapporteur's proposals, which will help clarify and improve the situation, should therefore be implemented as quickly as possible."
"We strongly recommend that a Parliamentary committee of inquiry be set up without delay."
"One aim here should be to bring about a general improvement in the Commission's administrative machinery, and not only in the tourism sector."
"But in addition, we need to rid tourism of its negative image and poor reputation."
"The tourism sector has always been treated like a Cinderella industry by the European Union and has never had its own legal basis in the Treaty."
"An intelligent European tourism policy could well provide new job opportunities like practically no other sector of the economy."
"It should also be borne in mind that while Europe still leads the world in tourism, it has for years been losing its overall market share."
"What is required here is therefore a radical purge which will place the Commission - both in terms of its staff and its budgetary affairs - in a position from which it can really do something for the tourism sector."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. If anyone thought that it was preferable for the European administrators to operate behind closed doors rather than in the full light of day, then the recent submission of the two reports being discussed today will have taught them differently."
"We cannot at present quantify the actual size of the loss which tourism in the European Union has suffered as a result of this negligence - and here I am choosing my words carefully."
"However, we must recognize at the same time that Parliament is very much committed to both these reports."
"Not only are we committed to obtaining a satisfactory settlement on the part of the Commission at the time of the 1996 ratification, but we are also not ruling out the possibility of a committee of inquiry."
"And even more importantly, we have entrusted ourselves with reforming the way in which our Committee on Budgetary Control operates."
"This has now become an important issue because both these reports have made clear, and indeed this has been done by other reports - such as those submitted by Mr VallÃ©s to the MED Committee and Mrs Kjer-Hansen to the PHARE -, that on the basis of the clearly insufficient flow of data available so far, we are not in a position to fulfil our role as the political representatives of the interests of European taxpayers."
"This will certainly not be possible in future for a so-called neutral committee."
"We must also ask ourselves, in the light of this and the decisions which we have to take in respect of these reports - and this must be done by Parliament and not by the Committee on Budgetary Control - just where we should locate our secretariat, for example."
"These are practical matters which now have to be addressed in the wake of today's report."
"We have made appropriate funds available to the European Court of Auditors, as the authority on budgetary control authority, so that it can do a better job in the future."
"We in this Parliament therefore have to be able to see this work through to the end."
"We are in the middle of re-defining our role as the controlling body of European bureaucracy."
"We must make it clear that the interests of the Commission and its members are not necessarily ours, and I think that in this light the two reports which have been submitted can be given our full approval."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the whole thing would be almost bizarre, if it were not so very serious."
"We are talking about events which took place years ago and which involved relatively small amounts of money."
"The countless investigations into the tourism industry go right back to 1989 and were carried out by the Court of Auditors, the European Parliament, the Courts and the Commission itself, which is being held fully responsible for the whole affair."
"Have we really nothing better to concern ourselves with than yesterday's news?"
"I, for one, believe that the real problem lies elsewhere."
"Is the tourism issue not much more symptomatic of the cross-dealing which has been going on within the Commission, and which has been suspected, and may still be, in other sectors too."
"It is Parliament's duty as a supervisory body to investigate these possible abuses, to point out where mismanagement, irregularity and even fraud has occurred, and to call for appropriate action to be taken and to ensure that this is done."
"To do this Parliament requires a continuous and unreserved flow of information, primarily from the Commission, even though some officials may have acted in a negligent or culpable manner."
"The mantle of immunity could also prevent their justified defence."
"In the case in question, the flow of information to Parliament has been slow and fragmentary, at least in previous years."
"It is to the credit of the Court of Auditors, with its two special reports, and also to the credit of our colleague and rapporteur, who has submitted three reports on the subject, that light has now been shed on the dark recesses of the tourism sector."
"These reports will not have pleased the Commission."
"Mrs Wemheuer has presented the chronology of the events in meticulous detail."
"On her own initiative she has uncovered previously hidden sources and scrutinized piles of documents, and I only regret that these could not be equally weighted and incorporated into her assessment."
"This information could well be used for preparing as yet unproven allegations of guilt."
"Though the European Year of Tourism is at the heart of the report, Mr De Luca refers in particular to further serious abuses at Directorate-General level, but goes on to mention a number of improvements which the Commission has sought to introduce."
"However, these measures, as outlined in the various verbal and written statements by the three Commissioners, namely Mrs Gradin, Mr Liikanen and Mr Papoutsis, as well as by the member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, are still inadequate."
"Our demands are clear cut: we want greater transparency, the unreserved supply of information - especially when EU officials appear to be involved -, independent powers of investigation by UCLAF, examination of the question of immunity and strict financial control, to name but a few."
"As stated earlier, we are very serious about both these resolutions."
"Merely threatening to set up a European Parliament committee of inquiry serves no real purpose, in my opinion, if we are not prepared to make use of such an instrument."
"It would be much more useful to put our own house in order by strengthening the powers and personal resources of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Let us hope, Mr President and members of the Commission, that by working together we can make a fresh start for a brighter future."
"Mr President, Commissioners, Mr de Luca and Mrs Wemheuer have cast a new light on developments as regards fraud, which is a matter that has concerned me since I first came to this House."
"On this occasion, we are not talking about national operators, nor about Member States, but about what a little-loved Commission official called ""the rotten heart of Europe ' ."
"What we have here are situations that cannot be played down, dysfunctions that cannot be ignored, legal aspects which are not dealt with and failures to observe what is known as transparency, and which I would call honesty."
"Let there be no doubt, corruption and fraud must be combatted, beginning with the prevention of fraud at home."
"Where it does occur, it must be punished, the criminal law regimes of Member States must be harmonized so that a manner may indeed be found to severely punish any who act fraudulently."
"I consider Mr de Luca's approach to be extremely positive, and he outlines exactly what happened in Directorate-General XXIII in connection with European tourism, which is such an important source of revenues."
"Action must be taken on the legal front, upstream, before fraud occurs, as well as after the event, downstream, with a view to identifying a means of severely punishing those who flout the rules of what is known as ""good practice' ."
"I believe that this is where the battle must be waged, and I am confident that the Committee on Budgetary Control has adopted the correct course. Moreover, I consider it a privilege to take the floor here today, since I am acquainted with the Committee's members and with its excellent work to date."
"Mr President, the findings of the Court of Auditors on financial management in the tourism sector during the period 1990-1995 are disconcerting."
"A clear definition of objectives and acceptable budgets was missing from contracts, as well as a guarantee for the impartiality of the selection board."
"Officials did not have adequate qualifications. Projects were approved without a stamp from the Financial Controller and subsidies were paid out without proofs of receipt."
"In short, an environment existed in which there was plenty of scope for irregularities and fraudulent practices."
"We are pleased to note that, within the context of SEM 2000, the present Commission is working on improving financial management."
"The Task Force for investigation into alleged fraud in the tourism sector, which was set up by the Commission, is worthy of appreciation."
"Yet this Parliament is by no means able to close the case on fraud."
"A large part of improperly allocated sums have yet to be recovered, after all."
"The impartiality of the selection boards has yet to be guaranteed and disciplinary measures have yet to be taken against the high officials responsible."
"Setting up a committee of inquiry is a weighty political instrument."
"But if the Commission does not comply suffieciently with the requests in the De Luca report, Parliament will be forced to use this instrument."
"I would like to insist that the Commission has another thorough look at the usefulness of the Community tourism programmes."
"The fact that up until now the projects have not been subject to effective evaluation is a serious error."
"If the Commission does not start working on this with some energy, Parliament will have to draw the obvious conclusion from this when the budget is set for 1999."
"We cannot go on indefinitely allowing credits for projects of which the effectiveness cannot be proven."
"In addition to their effectiveness, the question of whether the European programmes have in fact an added value compared to national actions will also have to be checked."
"According to Mr De Luca, the importance of tourism as part of the Community policy is undisputed."
"I can assure him that this is not the case in this sector."
"No one has ever been able to convince me, in any case, of the need and usefulness of a European policy on tourism."
"And I am not alone in this."
"Mr President, today we are debating an old issue."
"But despite long familiarity with the matter, I am still disturbed by the way in which it has been conducted."
"Issues like this serve to underpin the many myths and untruths that abound concerning EU institutions."
"More and more people around Europe believe the Commission to be a closed system that refuses to adjust to its surroundings and citizens' requirements and that it is an enormous bureaucracy where half the officials cheat and deceive while the other half endeavour to cover up the illegalities."
"People become suspicious and alienated about European cooperation."
"As a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I know that these myths are not true."
"I know that the Commission is far superior to its reputation."
"It is our job to make citizens aware of the many positive aspects of European cooperation, but we must also take existing problems seriously."
"We must be open about problems and respond quickly when they arise."
"Unfortunately, there are those in the Commission who have not carried out their work properly in this matter, and here I am not only thinking of those who have taken part in actual fraud, but also of those who have subsequently investigated the matter and whose responsibility it has been to inform Parliament."
"Those who have not carried out their work properly bear a serious responsibility."
"They are helping to fuel the scepticism and alienation about the EU that is extant in many Member States."
"There are also, however, things to rejoice about."
"In particular, Mrs Wemheuer's work in this matter has been exemplary."
"I would also like to express my satisfaction with the Commissioner for the Budget, Mr Liikanen."
"I feel we are speaking the same language as regards administration and openness in the EU institutions."
"I believe that the Commission has learned from this regrettable issue of tourism, but that will remain to be seen when the next fraud case comes up."
"Let us hope the same mistakes will not be repeated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion introduced by Mrs Wemheuer, as amended, is not an accusation against individuals but against flawed and suspect procedures which have nurtured the trade for decades."
"Because of those procedures, the furtherance of penal and disciplinary matters has been and is being delayed and claims are being set aside."
"The victims of all this delay are productive branches of Europe's economy, in this specific instance tourism, which lack and have been deprived of Community support because of the prevailing mistrust surrounding the funding of those branches."
"A classical example is the HOSPITALITY programme, whose funding was secured at the very last moment, last December, precisely because nobody wanted to support a programme for promoting tourism which was in other respects exceptional."
"A second matter I should like to mention, ladies and gentlemen, is that the Committee on Budgetary Control cannot properly carry out its task concerning the granting or not of discharge to the Commission in respect of its responsibility to implement the budget, for the simple reason that the Commission does not provide the European Parliament with any figures."
"How can we recommend to the House that it should or should not grant the Commission discharge if the Commission itself does not provide us with facts and figures?"
"That is why a related amendment has been tabled, in which we ask that the Committee on Budgetary Control should be given the status of an investigative committee, so that when we ask for facts and figures, the Commission will give them to us."
"Another substantial factor, Mr President, in which your own personal contribution will be important, is that the structures of the Committee on Budgetary Control must be reorganized."
"It is impossible for the committee to function with the means provided for it today, nor with its present structure. Other speakers too have mentioned the issue."
"This should become a matter of the first priority for the Bureau, and for you personally, Mr President."
"I would also be very grateful if some corrections could be made, because some of the translations of Mrs Wemheuer's resolution into various languages are incorrect."
"I refer more particularly to the Greek translation."
"I ask for a number of corrections, especially in Articles 4 and 2."
"Mr President, I commend the two rapporteurs and agree with what has already been said here tonight."
"My few words are in regard to the De Luca report on the policy on tourism within the Union."
"The present tourism operational programme for my own country, Ireland, accounts for IRL 369 million, which is over 8 % of total Structural Fund spending."
"According to the mid-term evaluation on the spending of the Structural Funds in Ireland, carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute, over 30, 000 jobs will be created in Ireland in the tourism sector between 1994 and 1999."
"One of the most important issues which must be addressed with regard to the Irish tourism industry is how it will cope with the introduction of a single currency within the European Union."
"There are a number of aspects to this."
"Firstly, the introduction of a single European currency will result in lower interest rates which, in turn, will lead to higher consumer spending, which means a higher proportion of spending on Irish tourism-related products."
"Secondly, a single European currency brings with it a frontierfree zone for capital, where bureaux de change no longer exist."
"Finally, the elimination of transaction costs is good news for the Irish tourism industry as the costs of travel and the costs of holidays are greatly reduced."
"The future is bright, and the single European currency will bring with it an increased number of tourists, which will mean an increased number of jobs in Irish tourism and a healthy industry into the next century."
"Mr President, the two excellent reports from Mr De Luca and Mrs Wemheuer have shown one thing quite clearly: that tourism, although it has been a problem, is also a symptom of a much bigger problem."
"We have to tackle both: the problem that was the European Year of Tourism and the systems that are quite inadequate in the Commission - witness the inadequacy with which the report of the Court of Auditors was dealt with."
"This saga is nearly ten years old."
"It clearly predates the existing Commission."
"But the Commission, as an institution, has been slow in acknowledging its institutional culpability; and, I have to say, had the Commission applied the principles of forensic accounting properly, then the saga that was the European Year of Tourism would have been laid to rest in days rather than weeks."
"And yet we have had a saga that has continued for years rather than months."
"There are institutional lessons to be learnt as well as those that relate to the Year of Tourism itself."
"In that process, I have to say to the Commission as an institution - and here I am talking to the last Commission - that it was very seriously deficient in the information that it gave both to Parliament and the Court of Auditors."
"In any other context, other than this polite gathering, I would say that it deliberately misled: in plain English, it lied, and there was a process of deliberate deceit of the institutions that led Parliament to the Holzfuss report."
"The new Commission has been slow in acknowledging this, but there is much joy in heaven for the repentant sinner even when it comes later rather than sooner."
"So we do recognize and acknowledge Mr Liikanen's approach at penitence on behalf of the institution, even though we all accept that he was not directly responsible."
"But this saga is a litany of failure."
"It is a litany of a failed policy, of failure to control a contract, of failed financial control, of failure to disclose the faults, of failure to remedy the deficiencies, of failure to accept culpability and, above all, of failure to come clean at the earliest possible opportunity."
"In that process two things have been seriously damaged: the tourism policy itself has been damaged, but so too has the reputation of the European Union in general and that of the Commission in particular."
"The attitude of many people has been that if we make such heavy weather out of declaring the results of an investigation into what, after all, is a relatively small case, a relatively simple case involving a relatively small amount of money, how can public opinion express confidence that the same institution can deal with much larger sums of money in a much more complex area of policy with much more complex legislative arrangements?"
"I believe that the opinion of the public at large says something along the lines that had any commercial undertaking safeguarded its interests and its shareholders' interests with the same degree of cavalier inadequacy as the Commission has protected the taxpayer, then the only thing that would be booming would be bankruptcies."
"So we have to examine the lessons to be drawn."
"They are clear: that systems have to be investigated, examined and improved."
"If there is to be any discussion of committees of inquiry, it must be in that area, looking at the system by which the Commission examines allegations of inadequacy, of impropriety, of irregularity against itself and its staff."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control has to be reformed, not just in relation to staff, their location and their powers, important as those things are."
"We have to look again at structures and procedures so that the Committee on Budgetary Control becomes less some sort of atmosphere of interinstitutional happy families and becomes more interrogative with a sharper cutting edge, possibly sometimes doing less but doing it better."
"If those are the lessons that are learnt from the Wemheuer and the De Luca reports, then these two reports will have done Parliament and European taxpayers a great service."
"Mr President, this is one of those subjects where the very fact that it comes up so frequently in this Parliament shows that something is not working properly."
"And that is so despite the fact that Parliament is fulfilling its control function, the Court of Auditors has produced its reports, UCLAF has carried out its investigations and, Commissioners, I do not even have any doubts that the Commission is making a great effort to improve its control over the matters under discussion."
"However, all this will be of little use to us if there still continues to be insufficient coordination between the Commission and the competent national services."
"Also, there is still a need for the Commission to guarantee that it will automatically turn to the relevant national judicial authorities in cases of justifiable suspicion of fraud, corruption or any other crime in which officials are implicated."
"Neither the Commission nor Parliament can be satisfied until that is the normal procedure."
"Mr President, perhaps it is appropriate that I have the last word in this debate before the Commission."
"Could I just say that for the first six years I spent in the European Parliament, I was trying to push tourism up the agenda."
"In 1990 we had a celebration of that in the European Year of Tourism."
"The Commission completely failed to organize it properly and when we discovered irregularities it was also unable to organize a proper cover-up."
"This is why we are today, eight years on in the European Parliament, having a debate about two reports which deal with irregularities and fraud."
"My conclusions, as a result of this, are that (a) there should be no immunity for Commission officials; (b) that UCLAF ought to be separated from the Commission completely and made an independent body; (c) the Court of Auditors ought to be ashamed of the two reports it produced on the subject."
"I believe also that Parliament's Budgetary Control Committee ought to be strengthened."
"It ought, like the watchdog committees in the US Congress, to have the power to commission its own inquiries and then to bring in the Court of Auditors or UCLAF as appropriate."
"Lastly I am not satisfied that judicial action in the two Member States referred to - France and Belgium - has been quick enough."
"It is two years since charges were laid."
"I spoke to the Belgian magistrate yesterday who confirms that proceedings are going ahead in Belgium."
"In France the proceedings begin on 13 March."
"This is two years after charges were first laid."
"It is far far too slow."
"This will not be Parliament's last word on this matter."
"In 1994 the door was kept open on the subject of an amendment I tabled."
"I beg the Parliament, in its vote tomorrow, to keep the door open this time."
"Mr President, the fight against irregularities, fraud and corruption is a high political priority for this Commission."
"That message must be perfectly clear to those who consider tampering with the taxpayers' money for their own personal gain."
"On this overall objective I agree entirely with the two rapporteurs, Mrs Wemheuer and Mr De Luca."
"An efficient system to deal with these kinds of problems is also of crucial importance for the Commission as an institution and for the European civil service."
"At the outset I wish to reject the notion that the Commission has provided misleading information in the tourism case."
"This Commission has spared no effort in shedding light on the complicated affair."
"It has endeavoured to be as transparent as possible, its objective being to provide a reliable picture of events over the past few years."
"My services have been instructed to cooperate with Parliament in an open and constructive manner, whether it be tourism or any other area."
"I have made it clear that any suspicion of criminal behaviour should be pursued vigorously."
"In the case of tourism, my services have been involved from the outset in the investigations."
"The results of these efforts have provided the basis for the action taken against individual officials."
"UCLAF established immediate informal contacts with the criminal authorities in July 1994 and formally requested in December of the same year that criminal investigations be launched."
"Parliament has been briefed on a regular basis."
"Obviously there are limits to the amount of publicity that can be given in a case under criminal investigation."
"A restriction is normally imposed on the Commission if an ongoing case falls within national judicial confidentiality requirements."
"With this in mind, Parliament has, to the best of my knowledge, been offered both relevant and correct information."
"Let me now turn to what the Commission has done and to what it intends to do in order to be better equipped to deal with fraud and corruption."
"When I took office in 1995 the task of combating fraud was scattered around several different services within the Commission."
"My first step was to ensure that all anti-fraud units were brought under one single roof in UCLAF."
"As a consequence, UCLAF has developed into a comprehensive operational service."
"Over the past few years UCLAF has investigated more than 150 cases in the area of direct expenditure. These include investigations into a number of cases concerning irregularities within the Commission."
"Since 1995, Financial Control has conducted over 500 audits of beneficiaries and 20 financial system audits within the Commission."
"The reports may lead to financial corrections or to proposals for administrative improvement."
"A number of new measures in the area of sound and efficient management are presently being implemented in the Theme 2000 exercise."
"These measures include the strengthening of preventive aspects and a greater focus on audit and financial follow-up of results."
"I welcome a number of suggestions in the De Luca report which go in this direction."
"The Commission has outlined in detail the rules, practices and procedures in a document transmitted to you in November 1997."
"The same document also announced a number of action lines that would be implemented."
"Let me explain how I have followed up the action in my area of competence."
"Firstly, I am at present preparing a decision by the Commission that will establish clear and comprehensive rules concerning internal inquiries by UCLAF."
"This will allow UCLAF to act more rapidly and without obstruction."
"Secondly, the operational independence of UCLAF will be strengthened."
"This will be achieved by providing the head of UCLAF with a status similar to that of the independent financial controller."
"This means, among other things, that the head of UCLAF can request me in my capacity as the responsible Commissioner, to raise a particular case in the College of Commissioners."
"Thirdly, the organizational independence of UCLAF will be enhanced."
"I will transform the existing Directorate into a task force within the secretariat-general."
"In addition, I will propose that cooperation with judicial authorities be strengthened by a liaison unit within UCLAF of experts from the Member States in penal law."
"This was proposed in the Tomlinson report on transit."
"But it should be clear that this unit can only be a reality if the budget authorities support it."
"Fourthly, I will also improve the links between UCLAF and Member States."
"In practical terms this means that UCLAF will be the privileged interlocutor of the Commission for dealing with criminal matters in relation to fraud and corruption."
"A number of these questions will also be discussed next month in connection with the report from Mr BÃ¶sch."
"The Wemheuer report requests regular submissions by the Commission of information concerning UCLAF investigations and special audits by Financial Control."
"As regards UCLAF's investigation, I intend to review how the flow of information can be improved in a systematic manner."
"I will do this while respecting the rights of the individual and the obligations of confidentiality in investigations and in relation to judicial proceedings."
"As for a list of special audit reports by Financial Control, I will arrange for it to be provided to Parliament on a regular basis."
"I believe that the measures I have outlined will strengthen our capacity to deal with fraud and irregularities."
"However, it is my firm intention to continue the dialogue with Parliament on how we can continue to improve our performance in the fight against crime."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control and in particular the rapporteurs, Mr De Luca and Mrs Wemheuer, for their analytical examination of the subject of broader action in support of tourism."
"I hope you will appreciate our efforts, in cooperation with Parliament, to bring to a conclusion this exceptionally difficult matter which, nevertheless, taught us many useful lessons and gave us many experiences."
"I will first say something about clearing the files of the past."
"As you know, we decided to re-examine all the direct action undertaken on behalf of tourism between 1989 and 1995, even though the Court of Auditors had only asked us to re-examine the activities undertaken during the European Year of Tourism."
"I want to tell you, then, that by the end of the month this particularly difficult task of analytically examining all 800 of the activities undertaken up to 1995 will have been completed."
"Out of total payments amounting to ECU 31.4 million, so far excess payments of ECU 4.7 m have been identified."
"Demands have already been issued for the return of payments amounting to ECU 2 m and we have prepared further demands totalling ECU 2.3 m, while in parallel we have already recovered about half a million ECU."
"The process we have initiated is made particularly difficult by various factors, such as the time that has passed since then, the nature of the objectives and the difficulty of assessing some of the results."
"In parallel, many of these cases may end up in the courts since already 40 % of those ordered to return funds have disputed those orders."
"We are, however, determined to continue that work and to present a full account of its results as soon as possible."
"However, all that I have said so far concerns the accountancy aspect of the matter."
"But there is a series of more political issues which I should like to mention."
"A basic question raised by many Members of Parliament is this: ' what have you learned from this affair, what measures have you adopted, and also, what are the consequences for tourism?'"
"I would therefore like to mention our conclusions."
"Firstly, the activities on behalf of tourism did not just produce negative lessons but positive ones as well."
"For example, we learned, and I believe that most of us learned, that tourism is the largest industry in Europe and one of the most promising fields for the creation of new jobs, and is likely to remain so for decades to come."
"Secondly, the objectives of quality and competitiveness for European tourism must be supported by specific and coordinated action, in cooperation with the Member States and the industry itself."
"It calls for action with realistic aims, which will be assessed continuously as well as on an ex-ante and ex-post basis."
"Thirdly, Community action that influences tourism must be systematically coordinated."
"Indeed, in that context the DirectorGeneral of the European Commission's DG XXIII is already chairing an inter-service group that includes all the Directorates which undertake activities on behalf of tourism."
"Fourthly, if we want to be effective in acting on behalf of tourism, we need a legal framework which sets out that the tourism dimension must be taken into account when determining and implementing other policies."
"Some of those conclusions have been applied, initially in the adoption procedure, but also in the content of the Commission's proposal for the first multi-annual programme on behalf of tourism in Europe, HOSPITALITY, a programme that has been examined repeatedly by the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the tourism industry and 13 Member States."
"However, I think it is a serious contradiction for the European institutional bodies to declare that they want transparency, they want effective use of resources, they want and call for the cooperation of the Member States and want Parliament and the Council to exercise institutional control of the activities, while at the same time there are some Member States which are holding up the approval of a programme that safeguards precisely the aims we all agree on."
"Some people speak of hypocrisy."
"I simply call it a political contradiction, which will have to be resolved at some time."
"The second thing we did was to completely reorganize DG XXIII."
"The members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have already received a detailed note about all those changes."
"And the changes, which began exactly 18 months ago in close cooperation with my colleague Mr Liikanen, include inter alia the creation of two new units, one of which looks after resources and controls while the second looks after contracts."
"The strict procedures we apply in relation to the selection, monitoring and appraisal of the activities already reflect the recommendations in Mr De Luca's report."
"The result of those procedures is that today DG XXIII is one of the best Directorates in relation to implementing the SEM 2000 programme."
"I am sorry, however, Mr President, because, despite the fact that tourism is very important for employment and development, as the rapporteurs also recognise, this affair has unavoidably negative consequences related to the prospects of implementing an effective policy for tourism."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that is all I have to say at this stage of the debate."
"I think I have mentioned the most important matters that fall within my competence and concern the two reports."
"Nevertheless, as you know, I am always at Parliament's disposal to keep you informed about the progress of our work."
"I just want to add some remarks to the contributions from my colleagues."
"First of all, you said earlier that no disciplinary measures were taken in this matter relating to tourism."
"That is not so."
"Disciplinary measures were taken in 1995 and 1996 against Commission officials."
"Secondly, what is important is that last year the Commission produced a communication on the financial and administrative measures."
"We did so to the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"What is essential here is that we have created an established system where every suspicion will be investigated."
"It will lead to a decision either that there is no basis for further action, or to open disciplinary procedures."
"This has not always functioned properly, but our new procedures will make it function properly."
"Thirdly, we must also remember, even in this kind of case, that we must respect the rule of law."
"There is always the presumption of innocence and the right to a defence."
"I want to say that here, because there are many Commission officials today who feel threatened by this issue."
"We must always be very clear about identifying the problems so as not to create uncertainty for those officials who are carrying out their duties properly in every respect."
"Fourthly, the most important lesson to learn from this is that we must put our house in order."
"When we decide how to run the programmes, we must plan well: there must be a limited number of targets, simplicity of administration, clear rules of eligibility and, very importantly, transparency and openness throughout all the procedures."
"I agree with those who said that openness is the cheapest control because then those who did not get the money control those who got it."
"This kind of simplicity, clarity and openness is the best tool we could have."
"Of course we need good cooperation with all our controllers."
"We have the Court of Auditors with whom we work. It is not always easy, but it is an effort worth making."
"We have the Budgetary Control Committee in Parliament which is the voice of the European people and their elected representatives."
"We are ready to cooperate with you in the future also."
"I hope we can concentrate on these reform programmes."
"I have seen draft reports on the SEM 2000 programmes."
"There are many new challenges facing us on how we will run the Community spending from the year 2000 on."
"We must concentrate on those, taking into account the lessons we have learnt in the past."
"The Commission is ready for this cooperation."
"Mr President, on a point of information, Mrs Gradin stated that the Commission called in the police on the matter of DG XXIII."
"The Belgian police confirm that it was not the Commission but myself who called in the police."
"That is a fundamental point and the letters are available if Parliament is interested in seeing them."
"Can I repeat a question that I put to the Commission on 23 November: on how many occasions has the Commission called in the police on matters of internal fraud in its 41 year history?"
"It really is time that we had an answer to that."
"Mr President, I wish to make a very important point."
"Commissioner Liikanen told us a few minutes ago that disciplinary measures have been taken against certain officials; this statement is contradictory to what has so far been affirmed several times by the Commission in the presence of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I would therefore like the Commissioner to be more specific and tell us which officials, when and why they have been penalized."
"Otherwise, we will perpetuate an extraordinary situation in which some people go before Parliament to provide information and then the Commissioners state the contrary."
"I would not like it to be simply a slip on the part of Commissioner Liikanen."
"Mr President, as far as I am aware, the Commission contacted the Belgian police in September 1994, whereas your contact came in February 1995."
"Mr President, the text is in French. I will read it to you, ""the authority invested with the power of appointment, through the decision of 22 June 1995, with effect from 1 August 1995, imposed the punishment of dismissal, with full pension rights, on a civil servant."
"Later, the AIPN (Appointing Authority), through the decision of 28 July 1995, imposed the punishment of termination of a temporary contract on a civil servant with effect from 1st August 1995.'"
"I can give Mr De Luca the detailed text."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Macro-financial assistance for Ukraine"
"The next item is Mrs E. Mann's report (A4-0025/98), on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the proposal for a Council Decision providing supplementary macro-financial assistance for Ukraine (COM(97)0588 - C40614/97-97/0312(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us is once again quite a technical one."
"But we have managed this before and we shall again succeed in presenting it successfully to Parliament."
"What we have to make clear is that even the macro-economic aid which we are sending to Ukraine is but part of an overall strategy which is designed to have a positive impact on the difficult process of transformation under way in that country."
"This involves Partnership and Cooperation Agreements as well as an interim agreement, but what is much more important at the present time is the action plan which we have before us and which Mr Titley will shortly be presenting to Parliament."
"This report will explain how the plan is creating synergies and will describe how this has been developed within the various EU programmes for the benefit of the people of Ukraine."
"Now to the macro-financial programme."
"The Commission is proposing that the EU should make a third loan available to Ukraine to offset the country's balance of payments."
"The amount involved this time is ECU 150 million and the loan is to run for 10 years."
"The Commission announced this back in December 1996 and the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers gave the plan its basic approval in January 1997."
"The ECU 150 million loan means that the European Union will be meeting almost one quarter of Ukraine's anticipated financial deficit for the 1997 to 1998 period, which has been estimated at ECU 765 million."
"The EU's involvement will follow the customary rules."
"The funds which the Commission will be raising on the capital market are to be allocated to Ukraine under normal terms and conditions."
"The granting of the loan is conditional upon the abovementioned economic requirements for macro-economic stabilization and continued structural adaptation."
"Verification will be carried out at regular intervals, in close cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to ensure that these requirements are being met."
"The repayment of the loan is covered by a guarantee from the European budget."
"According to the terms of the resolution establishing the guarantee fund, the Member States are obliged to contribute 15 % of the loan, in this case ECU 22.5 million, to the guarantee fund."
"Each year the Commission will report to the Council and to Parliament on the continuation of these loan options."
"Other important aspects include the fact that outpayments in this case are to be made in two instalments, something which is not usually done, and that the auditing criteria are to be laid down by the IMF and also by the World Bank."
"The European Union will be relying quite closely on these criteria."
"The first requirement is that satisfactory progress should be made by the macro-economic programmes."
"This macro-economic programme has been drawn up with the International Monetary Fund as part of the standby credit agreement."
"The second criterion is that progress has to be achieved in the area of structural reforms."
"We know that this is a very critical point and that we in the European Union, and of course even more so in the European Parliament, have always urged Ukraine to make greater headway with its programme of structural adaptation than it has done in the past."
"As has already been stated, this is the third package of financial aid which the Community has made available to Ukraine for its extensive programme of adaptation and reform."
"In 1996, Ukraine decided to embark on a programme of stabilization and reform, in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund, for the period 1997 to 1998; as far as I recall, this programme was to be supported by an extended funding facility."
"The Ukrainian parliament failed to ratify this government proposal and the parties could not reach agreement on the fundamental aspects of the programme."
"The government then approached the IMF with a new proposal - the one now before us - which calls for additional financing for a short period, namely 1997 to 1998."
"The progress being made in respect of stabilization and macro-economic reforms has clearly slowed down."
"That is all too obvious."
"I should like briefly to describe two amendments which the Committee on Budgetary Control has introduced."
"I have proposed that we adopt one of these amendments, while I, for my part, have rejected the second."
"Both amendments call for the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear plant to be made one of the auditing criteria for the outpayments, this applying to the tranche payments as well as to the overall programme."
"I have already said that I find this completely acceptable."
"The Commission has indicated the same."
"The Committee on Budgets has extended this arrangement."
"From a general point of view I can accept this extension, but I believe that for the examination of both tranches we should not again be introducing further provisos for checking on the closure of Chernobyl, which is scheduled for the year 2000."
"Mr President, I should first like to thank Mrs Mann most sincerely for her report and for the excellent work which she has done generally for Ukraine, including her contribution as a member of the delegation."
"Mrs Mann started off by pointing out that the report had a certain technical content."
"From the number of Members present in plenary one immediately knows when a really technical report is on the agenda."
"On the other hand, this report undoubtedly has a very significant human angle, something which has been given too little attention."
"We should not forget the degree to which the stability of Ukraine is dependent on support from the European Union."
"Ukraine is without doubt one of those countries of the former Soviet Union which, in spite of the huge economic problems facing it, has succeeded in making the greatest apparent progress from a European perspective. It is a country which has found its own route, and a relatively stable one at that, out of the complex mass which was the Soviet Union."
"That is why it is so important for us in the European Union to show our support for this independent route and to show that we will continue to provide support in spite of all the difficulties. As Mrs Mann and others have stressed, Ukraine has taken on certain responsibilities in association with the World Bank and other institutions which are ready to lend financial assistance."
"I believe it is extremely important that the financial package should include Chernobyl and the Chernobyl auditing criteria."
"Mrs Mann also supports this view to some extent."
"We used to say at one time that we would support Ukraine in the building of the ROVNO II and CHMELNITZKY IV nuclear power plants, provided that Chernobyl is shut down in return."
"I do not think - and I am speaking as an Austrian - that we really intend this to be the correct solution to the problem."
"We must support Ukraine and enable it to build up its infrastructure in such a way that it can do away with these dangerous Russian reactors altogether."
"Helping Ukraine to take an independent road should now be our main concern."
"Mr President, first of all I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Mann."
"Secondly, I want to say that, although the report is of course highly technical, its technical nature is interwoven both outside and inside with a very specific political content."
"Both my group and I will be supporting this report, in other words we will vote for the motion on the need to grant a new loan to Ukraine, since the new loan has two objectives: firstly, to assist the country's economic development and secondly, to foster political stability there, which is a very important factor."
"These two objectives are contributions towards improving the quality of life for the people who live there."
"However, regardless of the fact that both I and my group will be voting for the report, I would like to express my disagreement with the prerequisites laid down by the Committee on Budgets, more especially concerning the Chernobyl nuclear reactor."
"I would like to inform you, Mrs Mann - and I said the same thing to the Committee on Budgets - that three times, in response to questions of mine about whether the money already given to Ukraine for that purpose, i.e. to close down the Chernobyl reactor or to improve its external cladding, was in fact used for that purpose. The Commission, the responsible Commissioner Mr Van Den Broek, told me, very diplomatically of course but very clearly, that there were suspicions that the money was not spent for that purpose at all."
"That, if you will, is why the Committee on Budgets has been particularly strict in respect of the prerequisites for granting the second instalment of the new loan."
"Recognizing Ukraine's other needs, despite what I have said, my group and I will vote for the report."
"However, this will be the last time we approve a loan of this kind without specific answers, not only to the other issues you have rightly raised, but also concerning the Chernobyl nuclear reactor."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I would like to start by also congratulating Mrs Mann on her excellent report."
"Since its independence, Ukraine has been occupying a strategic position as a bridge between the East and the West."
"It is therefore very important that the European Union supports Ukraine where possible on the road to free trade and democracy."
"Unfortunately, the necessary economic and political reforms only happen with difficulty."
"Economic growth is extremely important to the development of a stable situation."
"A reliable energy sector is needed."
"Despite a substantial decrease in the demand for energy this sector is wrestling with big problems in Ukraine."
"That is why the Union is giving considerable support as part of the TACIS programme."
"Many of these European subsidies could be spent more effectively."
"This concerns first and foremost the choice of projects."
"In particular, in the sphere of energy, a diffusion of existing, older technologies, such as nuclear technology, is often chosen, while it is in this area, above all, that the European Union can play a initiating and steering role by promoting energy efficiency and by stimulating environmentally-friendly solutions."
"Secondly, when loans are granted, the question of whether the project the money is allocated to offers the most cost-effective solution should be looked at."
"My group is still not convinced that the construction of two nuclear power stations in Ukraine to replace the loss of capacity as a result of the closure of Chernobyl is the least cost option economically speaking."
"Investments, energy efficiency and clean sources of energy are at all costs to be preferred above maintaining nuclear power stations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, financial aid sounds all very well."
"But unfortunately we are being asked here to vote for a process which will keep in motion the international money merry-go-round."
"This money is not intended for public programmes."
"I quite agree with you that Ukraine is in urgent need of major aid programmes to help it achieve stability and democracy."
"Yet with this financial assistance we are using public money from EU taxpayers to pay off the debts which the IMF and the World Bank have established in Ukraine."
"These so-called stability programmes completely fail to take account of the realities of the social and economic problems posed by this transformation process, but rather promise to plunge Ukraine into insolvency."
"The EU's so-called macro-financial aid is therefore simply a transfer payment via the Ukrainian budget to the IMF and World Bank."
"The proposal of the Committee on Budgets is worthy of support and we can accept it."
"But in view of the actual international finance deal being done here, even this proposal will not be workable."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current proposal aiming to grant supplementary macro-financial assistance of a maximum of ECU 150 million to Ukraine follows the ""Ecofin' Council's agreement in principle of January 1997."
"The presentation of the Commission's proposal has been delayed for the following reasons."
"Firstly, there were considerable delays in the disbursement of the second instalment of the previous Community macro-financial loan to Ukraine, due to legal problems on the part of the Ukrainians."
"Secondly, there were changes beyond our control in the implementation of the 1997/98 economic programme, which was supported by an IMF stand-by arrangement of US$ 549 million."
"The implementation of this programme has just been reviewed and is now considered satisfactory."
"The Ukrainian economy must now face up to particularly difficult internal and external challenges."
"Delays in the implementation of vital structural reforms risk reducing the results obtained over the last few years, in terms of macro-economic stabilization to nothing, in particular the drastic reduction of inflation and the introduction, under satisfactory conditions, of a new, stable currency."
"Furthermore, under the influence of the monetary crisis in South-East Asia, Ukraine's prospects for external funding have deteriorated."
"In this context, the Commission considers that the granting of supplementary macro-financial assistance to Ukraine would send a clear signal that the Community is ready to provide substantial additional assistance if the Ukrainian authorities take the courageous economic policy measures that are necessary to maintain the reform process within the country."
"This assistance has the aim of further strengthening Ukraine's position in terms of foreign exchange reserves and of contributing to the reduction of social costs linked to the implementation of the necessary structural reforms."
"Complementary financial assistance is also expected on the part of other bilateral donors, in particular the United States and Japan."
"Following Parliament's example, the Commission considers a commitment on the part of the Ukrainian authorities to implement the plan for closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power station to be essential, according to the terms supported by the G7 and the European Union."
"The preamble to the proposal for supplementary macro-financial assistance contains an appropriate reference to this closure."
"In this respect, the Commission is able to adopt the European Parliament's amendment."
"In conclusion, I would like to mention that, within this context, the Commission welcomes the Ukrainian authorities' decision to consider the current economic programme as an interim programme and their firm desire, at the highest political level, to prepare a detailed and complete programme of medium term economic and structural reforms likely to put the country firmly back on track towards lasting growth."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"R & D activities (1997 annual report)"
"The next item is Mr Bloch von Blottniz' report (A4-0031/98), on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the Committee's annual report on the research and technological development activities of the European Union (1997) (COM(97)0373 - C4-0435/97)."
"Mr President, if today we are to debate the 1997 annual report on the EU's research and technological development activities, then we should also be asking a number of fundamental questions."
"What, for example, is the point of having an annual report when the measures which Parliament called for in the previous annual report were not put into effect? You know the story - the dogs bark and the caravan moves on."
"Obviously the Commission has made efforts in some areas by conducting a statistical assessment of assisted projects and by presenting a clear description of the Fouth Framework Programme."
"But some fundamental aspects are still outstanding, such as the links which exist with other programmes and the work of our JRC."
"We need an evaluation system for the results of the RTD initiatives and activities, which will serve as a basis for future reports."
"We should also have an independent chapter devoted to assessing the role of funding in the case of individual programmes for large industrial enterprises and, in particular, an evaluation of the possible knock-on effects."
"Commission statements on personnel and administration costs should also be more precisely quantified and classified, since otherwise we will suspect that the costs involved are too high when measured against what has been achieved."
"To sum up, the 1997 annual report is in many respects just a collection of facts and figures."
"Only in very few cases does it contain any well-founded or singularly interesting analyses, such as in the description of the scientific and technical results achieved through the Fourth Framework Programme."
"Here the Commission refers to major breakthroughs and achievements, including the satellite monitoring of forest fires, new discoveries relating to the volcanic eruption on Iceland and the development of an ocean survey robot capable of operating 6 000 metres below sea level."
"Projects like this contribute little or nothing to the common objective of improving the quality of life and promoting economic development."
"The study of global climate change, information and communications technology, the development of clean energy technologies and energy efficiency are far more likely to lead to an improvement in the quality of life."
"The question which we should be asking at all times is whether the research activities being promoted are likely to benefit mankind, and whether they are ethically justified."
"This important point is all too often lost in obscurity and the research work then becomes independent of outside control, serving to benefit only a few specialists and even carrying the risk of becoming antidemocratic and contributing to its own alienation."
"Only in very exceptional cases is the lot of mankind enhanced in any significant way by research of this nature."
"Let me finish by saying something about the SME problem-child."
"There is still an urgent need to come up with a simplified procedure for these companies."
"The application and proposal procedures are too complicated and time-consuming and for this reason they usually fail to reach the target group."
"In my opinion it would be far more sensible to set up a Commission department exclusively for small businesses - rather than for their medium-sized counterparts, for which we already have a staff of up to 500 - to help them with their applications."
"Industry itself has a department for this purpose."
"Such a set-up would introduce real innovation, create real job opportunities and prevent the knock-on effect."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the uninformed reader might well ask why we bother to present this report at all."
"He will simply get the answer, ""because it is part of the Treaty' ."
"But to me such a justification hardly seems adequate."
"I would to like to examine in more detail whether the report is supposed to be a description or an evaluation."
"If it is merely a description, then its results can be easily guessed at."
"You only need to be a first-year organizational sociologist to know that if you ask an organization how things are looking, you will get the answer, ""things are looking good' ."
"No, ladies and gentlemen, this report cannot merely be descriptive in its purpose."
"I wish to see an assessment, an analysis of the EU's research policy."
"I want to be given a compass, a chart for negotiating my way through the Bermuda Triangle which is European research policy."
"When I compare this year's research report with last year's, a certain trend becomes apparent."
"We see a whole collection of new listings."
"Even the regional allocation of research funds has been broken down according to the various beneficiaries."
"In my view three fundamental questions have still to be answered."
"Firstly, when we speak to applicants for European research funds, the motto seems to be ""frustration not administration' , because many selection procedures are non-transparent and rejections are not explained."
"There is no emphasis on European research objectives."
"I would like to see an inquiry into why this is so."
"I want more than just an assurance of greater transparency and the simplification of procedures."
"Secondly, the EU research policy is like a string of lights with 20 specific programmes."
"I should also like to know which of these lights is the brightest, which one has the most impact and where can we add a few more bulbs."
"We do not want another description. We have had this one and that one and we have spent enough money on them."
"No, what we really need is an evaluation of the potential impact of the individual programmes, and for this purpose we really require a coherent system so that proper comparisons can be made."
"Thirdly, we need to re-examine the research task forces which were set up at great expense in terms of Commission manpower and also in respect of the official publications, which were an innovation in EU research policy."
"When I look at this research report, I see that two whole lines have been devoted to the setting up of the task forces."
"I think that we have given these task forces not just a first-class burial but a third-class one."
"I think that this aspect, which Parliament fully supports, should definitely be looked into."
"There is nothing wrong with different Directorates-General and Commission departments talking to one another - on the contrary, this should be encouraged, as should cooperation."
"One can of course criticize the task forces too, but this initiative should be analysed in-depth so that we can obtain guidelines for the future."
"Let me again ask the question: why do we bother bringing out this report?"
"Why do we sacrifice so many innocent trees to do it?"
"Have we really developed the Titanic mentality? Everything is just fine, the bulkheads are holding, the rivets are okay and we are so happy that everything is doing so well."
"No, I, for my part, want to know the problems and the risks, and I want to be able to analyse things and to look for improvements and for new ideas."
"For, after all, nothing is so good that it cannot be improved on."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, like the two Members who have already spoken, we also think that this report ought to have a very different focus in order to be of use to the Commission, the Member States, research centres, Parliament and everybody."
"We are going to support Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz' report in its entirety, except for paragraph A, because it is out of step with reality - it involves value judgements -, and paragraph 16, because it is unrealistic."
"It will be very difficult for you to submit the report on 31 March because many accounts have not been closed."
"We think it would be useful if you were to carry out and include in the report a benchmarking operation - a comparison - of our results compared with those of Japan or the United States."
"I also want to mention paragraph 10 of Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz' report, which states that there are overlaps between the various Member States' own programmes and the EU programme, and suggests how to be a little more efficient."
"There are hundreds or thousands of projects and hundreds and thousands of administrative records, entailing a very high administrative cost. We realize that this is necessary, because there are so many projects, but it should be reduced."
"We trust that the Fifth Framework Programme will concentrate on the more important, larger projects, which are less spread out."
"We are not very happy - nobody is - with the budgetary provision, and we will be discussing the funding of the Fifth Framework Programme tomorrow and on other occasions in the future."
"But this will require us all to be much more efficient and to use the resources much, much better."
"The Joint Research Centre, with its seven sites, also needs different guidelines, Madam Commissioner."
"First of all, it seems to me we have to give the researchers their freedom, but not to the extent that each one does whatever he or she wants, and there should be an indicative programme, which perhaps could be implemented by the Institute fof Prospective Technological Studies in Seville."
"The Fifth Framework Programme offers us many opportunities and I hope that we all avail ourselves of them."
"In any case, we will support this report."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz on her report and comment on some of the points she made."
"In paragraph G there is a certain inconsistency in her comments about profits and competitiveness."
"I am sorry that the rapporteur seems not to approve of the private sector firms who make a profit and yet wants them to boost their competitiveness."
"It seems to me that profits are the best measure of competitiveness."
"I welcome her statements in paragraph I that SMEs are the most important source of technological innovation but we must remember, as other colleagues have said, that participation for SMEs is more difficult and we should not expect too much from them."
"I share the rapporteur's views in paragraph 6 about the absence of any review of those famous task forces on which we spent so much committee time."
"Perhaps the Commissioner might care to address that point in some way in the near future."
"In paragraph 12 the rapporteur sets out a long list of extra administrative tasks for the Commission in making reports, and I would suggest that we must beware of criticizing procedures for being complex and bureaucratic and then in the next breath calling for more of the same ourselves."
"Finally, taking up a point made in the explanatory statement, I see no harm in R & D being about economic growth since that is how we improve the condition of life for our citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Europe must be competitive in the area of science and research."
"In those areas in which it holds a leading position, the Union must hold its place; in those in which it is lagging behind the other world partners, it must make up lost ground."
"However, this aim of making technological research and development competitive should not obscure the other three objectives that constitute the very foundation of its policies: to speed economic and social cohesion between its Member States and between European regions in this field; to direct research and priority actions towards achieving a better quality of life; and to open up to cooperation with the emerging economies by adapting strategies to the conditions that prevail there."
"While the Commission report refers with satisfaction to the rising percentage of Objective 1 Member State participation in European projects, it neglects to mention the quality of this participation and the assessment of results."
"Indeed, of the 25, 000 research partners and the 3, 000 publications and patents emerging from Community research in 1996, how many were effectively translated into concrete results for the weaker members of the Union?"
"The major difficulty encountered by small and medium enterprises lies precisely in translating the results of research into applied innovation."
"This difficulty is particularly acute in the less developed countries."
"The work of the six task forces dealing with the major projects developed by enterprises and institutions of the technologically-strong Member States will only produce the desired results for the Union if its weaker members are simultaneously strengthened."
"In addition, I would like to see the Commission, in its next annual report, presenting a real state of the Union-type report regarding all technological research and development policies, as opposed to confining itself to Community-funded projects as it has to date."
"Such an overview of Europe's scientific and technological capacity is an essential basis for future planning."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report, and I will end by identifying two strategic priorities for the future: reformulating structural policies in such a way as to incorporate SME research as a priority dimension; and helping Member States to enhance the efficiency of their research policy management."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would above all like to thank Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz for the quality of attention she has paid to this 1997 annual report on the research and technological development activities of the European Union and for the seriousness with which she has examined this document."
"Her report contains suggestions which will prove to be extremely useful in the future."
"But before commenting in further detail on this report, I would like to share with you the recent developments which have occurred with regard to the Fifth Framework Programme, which is currently under discussion within the European Parliament and the Council."
"This inspires divided opinions, to say the least."
"The positive aspect is that the Council, during the Research Council of Thursday 12 February, reached a political agreement on a common position on the Fifth Framework Programme."
"This was not a foregone conclusion, far from it."
"The risk of breaking the Union's continuity of effort in research - if it still exists - now appears to be eliminated, but we must maintain the momentum we have gained."
"Unfortunately - and this is the worrying point - the common position in question is quite far from that which was proposed by the European Parliament and the Commission."
"Once more, and hopefully for the last time, the rule of unanimity has demonstrated its negative effects, since, in principle, two Member States forced the others to lower the budget."
"The adopted decision makes the formal stand of the Commission difficult."
"The Commission is obliged to dissociate itself from the position taken by the Council and to express its disagreement and concern on several points."
"The first relates to the overall amount."
"The Council agreed on a figure of ECU 14 billion, well below the ECU 16.3 bn proposed by the Commission, which remains convinced of the validity of this figure, and even further below the figure of ECU 16.7 bn which Parliament gave in its opinion during first reading."
"This amount is ECU 500 million less than a simple renewal, in real terms, of the Fourth Framework Programme."
"If it were finally adopted, we would witness, for the first time in the history of the Union, a decline in research efforts."
"At a time when the President of the United States, in his State of the Nation speech, is announcing an unprecedented increase in public American research efforts, the citizens of Europe would find it difficult to understand why the Union hesitates to mobilize one of its greatest assets, its intellectual potential and human resources, to the full, in order to strengthen its competitiveness and create jobs."
"The reduction in resources that would occur in such a scenario would have repercussions on all activities."
"However, it would particularly affect the Joint Research Centre, which would find itself deprived of the means to accomplish its mission in the service of the Union regarding policies on which a consensus had nevertheless been achieved."
"The Commission would then be obliged to seriously consider stopping certain activities considered to be essential."
"The common position of the Council furthermore contains some unnecessarily restrictive measures in the area of committee procedures, and some of you earlier highlighted the complexity of procedures."
"The Council text will increase this complexity, if we allow it to go through."
"By setting up separate committees for energy and the environment, as well as socio-economic research, the effect will be a virtual de facto creation of distinct programmes in these areas."
"Finally, with the adoption of the Fifth Framework Programme and its specific programmes, the Council is, on the one hand, setting out the future financial prospects for the Union, and on the other, establishing conditions which will again bring into question the principle of multi-annual budgets and predictability of resources which is the very essence and interest of the Programme."
"Once more, Parliament and the Commission find themselves on the same side, sharing the desire to build up Community research and to provide it with the necessary resources."
"The Commission knows that Parliament will in due course fight to set up a framework programme which corresponds to the needs of the Union."
"We are counting on you to help us make adjustments and to ensure that the final Fifth Framework Programme will be closer to the one proposed by our two institutions."
"Let me return now to what is concerning us today, the draft report and resolution on the 1997 annual report on the Union's research activities."
"Your rapporteur highlights the very informative nature of this report on many issues."
"She notes the improvements made in respect of previous reports, recognising, in particular, that a certain number of the European Parliament's recommendations have been taken on board."
"The Commission is happy that its efforts to make this document a useful instrument and to improve it continually have been taken into consideration."
"The draft resolution, however, sets out a certain number of criticisms and recommendations which demonstrate a misunderstanding of the very nature of this annual report."
"It cannot and must not be considered as an evaluation report."
"Basically, it is a document for information."
"Its aim is to give, with the help of as many precise factual details as possible, an overall view of the Union's activity in the area of research and technological development over the period covered, including projects initiated, results obtained and developments prepared."
"It seems to me that the 1997 report thus gives a fairly detailed and complete picture of research policy during 1996, including the implementation of the specific programmes of the Fourth Framework Programme and the first stages of the preparation of the Fifth."
"The point which must be borne in mind is the following: this report must be seen in the context of a wider system which also includes all of the follow-up reports on each specific programme and the Framework Programme as a whole, along with the five-year evaluation reports."
"Thus, two series of follow-up reports for 1996 and 1997 have been prepared and published."
"The preparation of those relating to 1997 has been initiated."
"In the context of the preparation of the Fifth Framework Programme, fiveyear evaluation reports have been prepared for all the specific programmes as well as for Programme itself."
"The latter has been drawn up by a group led by an expert on Community research, the former Commissioner, Etienne Davignon."
"I share the rapporteur's opinion that a rigorous evaluation of the content of the Programmes and the way in which they have contributed to the achievement of the wider political objectives of the Union is essential."
"This assessment will, however, be found in the evaluation reports."
"Therefore, the Commission clearly notes the numerous suggestions formulated in the resolution."
"It will be able to take them into account when implementing the overall policy."
"Undoutably, improvements will be made."
"The complementary nature of the three components, the annual report, the follow-up report and the evaluation report, must be strengthened."
"The information contained in all of these documents and the conclusions of the different exercises must, moreover, be made available in such a way that enables all potential users, starting with the European Parliament, to become acquainted with it within the necessary time frame and under the best conditions."
"The Commission intends to apply itself to improving the system in this way and will gladly welcome any suggestions that may help."
"The objective is the same as that of the Fifth Framework Programme."
"By definition, the Union's research policy is for the citizens of Europe."
"It must be implemented both in their interest and, in their eyes and those of the institution representing them, namely the European Parliament, with complete transparency."
"The Commission and Parliament often share the same views and they must fight together to enable this policy to realize its ambitions."
"I am sure I will be able to count on you in this respect and I thank you for your efforts."
"You have rightly drawn our attention to several points, on the complexity of the procedure, for example."
"The Fifth Framework Programme has been designed to concentrate its actions."
"Such concentration is essential to improve management."
"We have gone from 22 to four programmes, four large programmes which are then divided into a variety of key actions."
"Nevertheless, there is a clear effort at concentration, which is in keeping with your requests."
"The problems of ethics, which you have rightly highlighted, are truly worrying."
"Efforts have been made to mobilize national ethics committees - where they exist since, as you know, they do not exist in all the Member States - so that they demand respect for fundamental ethical principles."
"The Commission's proposals for the establishment of the Fifth Framework Programme take up this demand once more."
"Many of you have emphasized the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises and it is a problem I am very aware of."
"You know that, although it was very weak at the start, the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Union's research programmes has continually increased."
"One essential step was the inclusion, in the Fourth Framework Programme, of what are known as technological stimuli, aimed particularly at small and medium-sized enterprises."
"These actions will of course be followed up and substantially strengthened under the ""Innovating and helping small and medium-sized enterprises to participate' programme, which provides, in particular, for: assistance in the area of intellectual property; financing for innovation; mechanisms to encourage the creation and development of innovative businesses; new approaches in technology transfer; and, finally, networking and information services."
"With a view to facilitating the participation of SMEs in the Framework Programme, increasing the efficiency of actions which concern them and reducing delays, accredited but not exclusive information and assistance networks will be developed by strengthening and rationalizing the existing structures."
"You can see that, on this particular issue of SMEs, we have already made progress, although obviously much remains to be done, and that structural and administrative measures will be established, under the Fifth Framework Programme, to enable us to respond better to the expectations of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Madam Commissioner, allow me to ask another question."
"Mr Chichester and I raised the subject of the task forces, which have not been reviewed in the report - or at least have only been given a two-line mention."
"In its statement the Commission also failed to say anything about the work of the task forces."
"In its response to a previous statement on the research report, the Commission said: ""the annual report serves to present to Parliament those aspects which are considered to be of prime importance' ."
"Am I then right in assuming that the task forces are not regarded as one of the more important aspects here?"
"The task forces, may I remind you, were not provided for in the Fourth Framework Programme since, when I arrived at the Commission, the Fourth Framework Programme had already been adopted; I introduced them along with a number of my colleagues in the Commission, in particular Martin Bangemann and Neil Kinnock."
"These task forces have looked into a number of crucial problems that specifically affect the competitiveness of European business in both the sectors where Europe is particularly competitive, as well as those where it comes up against fierce competition, and we have distinguished a number of important issues."
"We wanted to draw together researchers, manufacturers and others to consider these issues, in order to have a global vision."
"This led us, furthermore, to the multidisciplinary approach of the Fifth Framework Programme, which follows a slightly different philosophy to that of the Fourth."
"So the work that has been done by the task forces has not been lost."
"On the contrary, it has been extremely useful and has enabled partners with different outlooks, in all of the Member States, to come together and discuss the different aspects of a topic."
"This is what guided us through the Fourth Framework Programme."
"For the Fifth Programme, there are no longer any task forces, instead we have key actions."
"These key actions will work in the same way and according to the same multidisciplinary approach."
"Let me take the example of the key action known as ""the town of tomorrow' in the Fifth Framework Programme."
"In ""the town of tomorrow' we encounter problems concerning transport, pollution, housing and tele-commuting, as well as those concerning town planning, that is, socio-economic problems, particularly those affecting inner cities and suburbs."
"We have therefore chosen an approach around themes which will bring the different disciplines together."
"In other words, the task forces become key actions and we take a multidisciplinary approach."
"This is based on the experiences of the task forces and will be developed within the Fifth Framework Programme."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Risks from chemical agents"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0051/98), by Mr Blak, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Directive on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work (fourteenth individual directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) (C4-0531/97-00/0459(SYN))"
"Mr President, I am pleased and proud to be here today as rapporteur in the second phase of the proposed directive on chemical agents."
"I am glad that we have managed to break the three-year impasse in the Council."
"I am glad that we can now make progress in creating greater security and better working conditions for employees in Europe."
"And I am proud that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has reached agreement on a number of amendments; this will further enhance the prospects of the outcome in the Council in important areas."
"Almost four years have gone by since we last debated this proposal."
"It is regrettable that we have had to wait so long, because the directive on chemical agents is an important part of a large collection of legislation."
"It is part of the process that began in 1989 with the framework directive on improvements of employee security and health at work."
"The jigsaw puzzle of directives under discussion here will make Europe even more attractive, particularly for those in employment."
"First and foremost, it will be more secure and healthier to work in the Member States of the EU, and companies and workers alike can rejoice about the transparent and uniform regulations in the area of the working environment throughout the EU."
"In addition to this, however, a very important incidental benefit is also achieved through the creation of common regulations in this area: it is an effective way of tackling social dumping."
"Social dumping occurs when companies cross national frontiers to avoid giving employees decent working conditions."
"It is important to take the problem of social dumping seriously, particularly in the light of forthcoming enlargement."
"The proposed directive has two important components, to my mind."
"On the one hand, it clearly establishes the commitments incumbent upon employers in connection with chemical substances that may be damaging to the safety and health of workers."
"On the other hand, the proposed directive establishes procedures for joint initiatives to restrict chemical substances in the working environment."
"One of the most important instruments in this area is the possibility of establishing limit values."
"Let me be quite honest and say that I dislike limit values."
"In principle, one should endeavour to make the working environment so clean that there would be no need for limit values."
"Unfortunately, the reality is somewhat different."
"It is often very difficult to determine exactly how dangerous a given substance is, and it may be necessary to put pressure on people who do not want to give the employees the benefit of the doubt."
"Thus, there are instances when it may be necessary to set limit values."
"To my mind, the greatest inadequacy of the Council's common position is the lack of sufficient control in implementing the indicative limit values."
"What is lacking is some mechanism to ensure that implementation is assessed and that, if necessary, proposals be made to set mandatory limit values."
"Amendment No 4 addresses how to solve this problem."
"Major progress would be made if this were to be adopted here in the House tomorrow and subsequently adopted by the Council."
"I do not wish to go through all my amendments in detail."
"They are already explained in the background to the recommendation and have been discussed thoroughly in committee."
"However, there are two subjects that I must address, concerning two amendments in my recommendation."
"Firstly, Amendment No 10, aimed at supporting education as a means of minimising risks in the workplace, is a compromise in which a sentence has been mistakenly deleted, even though it actually supports the need for education and information."
"Therefore, I would like to encourage everyone to vote for this amendment from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which reintegrates this sentence."
"Secondly, there are problems with Amendment No 11."
"The English translation states that health surveillance procedures shall be agreed to by the workforce."
"This actually means that all workers at a given workplace would have to consent before any one of them could be subjected to a health check."
"Of course, that is not what we want, and we would therefore like to table an oral amendment substituting the word workforce with workers' concern ."
"Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the British Presidency on the work it has done on this subject."
"It has been very gratifying to see active and constructive efforts aimed at pushing the directive through."
"It is as if we now dare to recognise a social and international responsibility."
"I do not know why, but I can hazard a guess."
"If the directive on chemical agents is adopted by the Council at its upcoming meeting, this will not only be a victory for the British Presidency, but one we can all rejoice in."
"There are no losers in the long term when it comes to creating a more humane and more social Europe; there will only be winners."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate Freddy Blak very warmly on a tremendous job in preparing this report for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"He has recognized the fragility of the common position that took a very long time to reach inside the Council and, rather than seek to amend everything in sight, he has done the sensible thing and focused on a short list of issues that really matter."
"One of the most important, from my point of view, is Amendment No 4."
"I understand the logic of the Community laying down indicative limit values, requiring Member States to disseminate information on those indicative values and further requiring Member States to take them into account when they set their own corresponding national occupational exposure limit values."
"But that is not the same as requiring Member States to approximate to the indicative values laid down at Community level, or even move towards them."
"I was therefore concerned that this might lead to a continuing disparity and I am glad that Amendment No 4 would address that by allowing a regular review, based on the information provided by Member States under Article 15, leading, where necessary, to the Commission taking appropriate action to bring about closer harmonization."
"I understand the Commission is prepared to accept that amendment or a form of wording similar to it."
"Another important point, in view of recent cases I have dealt with, involving trichloroethylene and the recent exchange we had in committee with the Commission's representatives, is Amendment No 7 concerning substitution."
"It seems quite clear to me that some of the difficulties we are experiencing stem from the fact that we are not seeing proper implementation of the risk assessment and related sections of the framework directive."
"That is leading, for example, to the situation where in some Member States trichloroethylene, a dangerous solvent, is banned, and in some Member States it is subject to exposure limits far greater than those laid down in others."
"We have to work for a full and proper implementation of the framework directive but, in the meantime, the importance of substitution needs to be underlined in this directive, and Freddy Blak was quite right to do so in Amendment No 7."
"It is very good indeed to see that this directive has been resurrected after so long."
"However, I wonder what the prospects are for a number of other directives which continue to be blocked in Council, for example, the directive on various modes of transport and the directive on physical agents, which covers noise, vibration, optical radiation and fields and waves."
"I am particularly concerned about the subject of noise."
"The original 1986 directive on the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to noise at work has exposure and action levels which are hopelessly out of date."
"The then UK Government was very proud to have succeeded in pressing for a 90 decibel level for the mandatory use of ear-protectors at work."
"It held this up as a costsaving measure."
"But the cost for many thousands of workers has been paid in terms of reduced hearing and industrial deafness."
"That 1986 directive was supposed to be re-examined by the Council, on the basis of a Commission proposal, before January 1994."
"It is now February 1998 and unless that physical agents directive can be revived, we must in any case review that earlier noise directive."
"I hope we can receive an assurance on that point from the Commission."
"It would not be fair to expect Mrs Cresson to respond to that but I hope the point can be raised with Commissioner Flynn."
"I look forward to the Commission taking part in committee, at a hearing coming up within the next few weeks, on new emerging health risks."
"We have succeeded in dealing with some of the outstanding ones here - the older ones - and we have some new ones to tackle together."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report that is currently under discussion regarding the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a directive which provides a framework for the protection of the health and safety of workers is extremely important and useful for workers who may be subject, in any Member State, to exposure to chemical agents."
"This directive should not and cannot be further delayed."
"The matter in question deserves the greatest urgency and the closest attention of Member States, social partners and institutions of the European Union."
"The text of the Council's common position currently under discussion is clearer, more explicit and less prone to ambiguities or to any shirking of responsibility."
"The structure of the document favours a better definition and ordering of the objectives and scope of the directive."
"In this text, the definition of a dangerous chemical agent, and the mechanism for establishing occupational exposure limit values and biological limit values are more clearly defined and occupy a more prominent position."
"A clearer definition is given of the duties of the employer, the need for vigilance by workers, and the matter of consultation, information and participation of workers."
"An emphasis is placed on the Member States' obligation to enact legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions to facilitate the implementation of the directive."
"The report reflects some of the concerns raised at the present time, and no doubt in the future, by the common position."
"Meanwhile, however, the amendments now submitted by Parliament complement, improve and clarify the document under discussion."
"Many of the amendments proposed by Parliament at first reading have been incorporated into this text, with the result that it has been noticeably improved."
"I would briefly like to raise two points regarding the amendments."
"Amendment No 1 emphasizes the additional caution to be exercised regarding pregnant women and young people; in such circumstances, as in others, it is essential to protect current workers, but we should never fail to think of the future."
"Amendment No 10 relates to the importance that should always be attributed to the training of workers, as opposed to mere information."
"For these reasons, and others which have no place here, this report is certainly appropriate and is to be commended."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has certainly taken a long time for the Council's common position to appear."
"But at the moment it is better than the Commission proposal."
"I am extremely satisfied with the cooperation which took place with the rapporteur, Mr Blak."
"I therefore did not need to submit further amendments, although I intend to support Amendment No 16 by the Christian Democrats."
"What is the significance of this directive?"
"Different standards damage regulation in the Member States."
"Arguments related to competitiveness will always take the upper hand, after all."
"This is bad for the employees and it is bad for the victims."
"And those victims are often suffering terribly."
"One European policy with binding standards is therefore best, and we in the committee and in Parliament call for this in Amendment No 4."
"In fact, we should also be prepared to ban a number of solvents such as xylene, toluene and trichloroethylene, and Amendment No 7 points to the direction we must take in this respect, since industry is encouraged to seek substitution, and substitution can be found in the use of reactive solvents."
"In this context I would like to mention the solvents which are found in Marigold, for instance."
"An experiment has been carried out with this plant, which was funded by the European Commission, in fact, and showed exceptionally good potential."
"That is why, Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I would like to suggest that we, as the European Parliament, receive a periodic progress report, since I am not entirely confident about the implementation."
"I would like to conclude by saying something on educating, training and raising the awareness of people in the workplace."
"We have also submitted an amendment on this point."
"So the issue does not only involve banning chemical agents, it also deals with the handling of chemical agents."
"Once we have a decent package of proposals, I think we will able to take a step forward with this directive to combat the greater problem that lies behind it, for painters and other workers, for example."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mr Blak for the work he has done on this very important, but very difficult and complicated subject."
"Health and safety at work is one issue where EU legislation has a real effect on a person's normal working day."
"It has to do with people's mental and physical health, and their fitness for work."
"There cannot be anything more important than this."
"The EU must be able to provide a secure minimum level of health and safety at work to prevent sacrificing good working conditions in the name of competition."
"Health and safety at work do not just benefit the worker, but also the employer and the whole of society."
"This is why it is quite deplorable that this subject has remained on hold for such a long time in the Council, as we have remarked here on numerous occasions."
"This directive was featured in Parliament's first reading four years ago."
"Hopefully the completion of a common position by the Council means that the health and safety at work log-jam is breaking up at last, now that it is the British term of office."
"Mr Blak has proposed some amendments to the Council's common position, most of which I completely agree with."
"I am, however, concerned at the negative approach the report takes to setting biological limit values."
"The report states that biological limit values may be determined only in exceptional circumstances where other means fail."
"We in Finland, however, do not have such a restricted view on the biomonitoring of chemical substances."
"On the contrary, we believe that it is often an effective way of monitoring employees' exposure to dangerous chemicals, in order to protect their health."
"Naturally, the principle of biological monitoring is always agreed beforehand with workers' representatives."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, this argument really needs to be rammed home."
"Mr Hughes had to do it too."
"There has been much talk of cost saving in the area of health and safety at work, but no mention has been made of the costs which could be saved by those affected, and by our national economies, if we really introduced a proper safety scheme."
"As a result, we are again faced with a long-running scandal."
"Health and safety in the European workplace is not keeping pace with developments in the internal market and with technological progress."
"Mr Hughes has already referred to two directives which are still pending."
"In the case of this directive we need to discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the strategy which the Commission has chosen to confront the problem: elegantly-defined principles, progress without protection."
"The individual directives can be added later, while we focus on developing the main directive. But the price will be high."
"The problem lies in the content of the framework directive."
"We have to ensure that the individual directives do not fall behind the framework directive, and then there is also the problem of harmonizing procedures between the individual framework directives, such as that on explosive atmospheres - which is looming -, for this is creating increasing complications in individual cases and is hampering progress."
"I would just like to stress again that Mr Blak has done an excellent job."
"I do not believe that Amendment No 16 is better than Amendment No 3, and in the case of Amendment No 18, I would ask Mr Blak why the risk assessment has to be made at the beginning of the information form."
"Does this not run contrary to what he has said in Amendment No 6?"
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Freddie Blak for the work he has done on this report."
"It has been a hard fought for report and his endeavours have been greatly appreciated across the board inside the committee."
"While it is technical, it is also very real."
"In fact ten million people across the European Union suffer an accident or illness at work."
"This is a well-known fact and eight thousand of these people unfortunately die every year within the European Union."
"Many other unreported accidents, illnesses and deaths go by the board, of course."
"Many of these deaths and illnesses arise from ignorance and the taking of unacceptable risks."
"As long as these risks are ill-defined, it is right that the Commission should introduce legislation to mark these risks quite appropriately."
"Why do people take unnecessary risks?"
"We all do it now and then."
"We all cross the roads, perhaps without looking, and we all take inappropriate care."
"This is a bad attitude for life, and definitely a bad attitude for work, but these attitudes can be dismantled and reassembled in a progressive and positive way to stop the kind of problems we face at work."
"This is why this report, which is unlocked by the UK Presidency's initiative as Freddie remarked, aims at stopping the inappropriate behaviour of the use of noxious chemical agents which are some of the worst chemical agents that people can use at work."
"The hazards of using such chemical agents, must be assessed as to the risk for workers, not just from the immediate effects but the long-term effects as well."
"The training notices must have a substantial impact as well as training itself."
"This is why such importance has been given to training in this report, to the extent perhaps of widening the framework directive's interpretation of training and that is a welcome move."
"In small businesses, for example, workers are 50 % more likely to suffer from an accident at work."
"Why is this?"
"It is because there has been better training in larger companies and appropriate notices, none of which are obvious within smaller companies."
"Also, in larger companies risk is taken seriously because health and safety is regarded as a productive and profitable element for the future of any company structure."
"This is why the Safe Action for Europe project, which unfortunately cannot get past the question of a legal base, would have been quite appropriate for small businesses."
"Freddie has also mentioned relocation of chemical production and companies."
"I remember the case in Bhopal, India."
"Low social costs were given as the reasons for this."
"This meant that Bhopal is remembered as a major disaster and for total exploitation of the workers in that country."
"We must not forget that, if this is a directive which adds to the sum total of European workers' rights, perhaps we could be exporting this type of model elsewhere in the world."
"Certainly we must not let capital get away with simply exporting the dangers and disasters which we know beset this minefield in this particular Continent."
"It is progressive enough for us to feel that it will be significant in protecting workers and yet it is also realistic enough to produce results."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking on behalf of our group, Mr MendonÃ§a has already presented the technical aspects of this subject in some detail."
"I should therefore like to discuss some of the more general issues involved here."
"The Council allowed itself three and a half years before submitting a common position to Parliament after first reading."
"This shows just where the delay is in drawing up European legislation."
"The rapporteur has taken pains to ensure that the outcome in Parliament does not deviate too much from the common position, so that the directive on the protection of workers' health and safety from the effects of chemical agents at the workplace is neither further delayed nor threatened."
"No blame whatsoever can be attached to Mr Blak for this situation."
"He has done an excellent job."
"At all events, I expect him to give way to the amendment which I am re-submitting to Parliament."
"Let me present some of the important facts surrounding this subject."
"Technical directives of this type are very significant for workers and for workers' health, but plenty of even more important directives are still needed, for example, on teleworking and the wider aspects of part-time employment."
"When does the Commission think it will get around to doing something about this, or does it hope to divert us from the really important issues by submitting technical questions?"
"Does the Council intend to brood much longer over the directives mentioned by Mr Hughes?"
"The real victims of all this delay are the working people of Europe and we, as serving politicians in this European Parliament, cannot tolerate this situation any longer."
"We expect that progress will ultimately be made in this direction and that the Commission and the Council will take the appropriate steps to see that this is done."
"Mr President, the target must be that no people should be injured at work."
"The issue in this recommendation for second reading was first raised four years ago."
"Minimum rules are a requirement for people to be able to bring about reasonably equal conditions within the EU in this area."
"I would like, in particular, to emphasize the principle of caution, that is, that there should be a good margin for workers being exposed to risks."
"It is better to prevent than to discover risks afterwards."
"There is strong political opinion behind this report. We saw that at first reading and we can see it now."
"There is a unanimous committee behind these fifteen amendments."
"What we are proposing are improvements to the Council's position."
"The three most important which I shall emphasize here are: the evaluation of the implementation by the Member States; information to workers about the risks and the danger of agents; and training in protective measures."
"In addition, we must ensure that there is coordination between these measures."
"The Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party supports this recommendation for second reading from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Mr President, in ancient Greek 'the beginning of wisdom is to give thought to naming' means that one should always begin by defining one's terms in order to lend substance to action."
"I believe that we are now witnessing such a process in connection with a very important issue, which is reaching a favourable intermediate stage of completion."
"In other words, it will go further."
"I believe that whether we call it sabotage or just delay, this matter has at any rate taken a number of years to progress from first reading to the second reading here today."
"Mr President, it was the previous Parliament that gave the first reading and we are now occupied with the second."
"I can justify the fact that, as is being proved, this directive's development has shown that substantive redefinitions were needed."
"The directive as such, the rationale of its explanatory concepts and the statements that go with it are, I believe, so important to a degree that I would describe it, if I may, as a historic document."
"The question is, how well do the specific articles realize the intention?"
"I believe that with all this procedure of the common position, approaches have been made which bring hope and lend perspectives to this directive."
"I agree with the modest satisfaction expressed by our rapporteur, Mr Blak."
"I believe that the amendments constitute an important and substantive step, as we reiterate with persistence and steadfastness to the European Parliament, in the anticipation that they may now be acceptable. They represent a first step, and I believe that we are not just taking a first step but we are making tangible progress in relation to the situations and views that prevailed four years ago."
"I echo the call to the British Presidency to speed up, promote and complete this common position decisively, because that will enable us to save time."
"It has been said, stressed, and I too repeat it, that the definitions now being adopted are wise ones in that they are not absolutely binding."
"I believe that we really cannot, at this point in time, give a complete list of all the dangerous substances, because new ones will emerge which we do not now know, or hitherto unrecognized dangers will be discovered."
"This potential extension with the passage of time, precisely in order to prevent infringements of the directive based on today's criteria, is, I believe, one of the directive's strong points."
"This, then, is a framework directive which implements the very important Directive 89/391/EEC, but as a framework it allows for further scope and is an important starting point at the present stage."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Blak for the quality of the work he has carried out on this proposal, and to thank him and all of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their continued efforts to improve the health and safety of workers."
"The Commission greatly appreciates the constructive approach that has been adopted with respect to the common position."
"Firstly, I would like to highlight the political importance of the Council's common position."
"The Commission is convinced that the principles of health and safety protection must continue to be enhanced at Community level."
"The Council has recognized this in the common position and, although the text is clearly not perfect, it represents a considerable advance in the field of health and safety."
"Most of the European Parliament's amendments to the text of the common position are real improvements and can therefore be accepted by the Commission."
"I am referring to Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, the first part of 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 18."
"I would now like to comment on the few amendments which cause some problems for the Commission and which, consequently, cannot be accepted."
"The second part of Amendment No 5 imposes on employers the need to record a risk assessment in a suitable form, taking national law and practice into account."
"This measure would undoubtedly weaken the common position which anticipates that the documents should be established in accordance with national law and practice."
"I am convinced that it cannot be Parliament's intention to permit a discretionary appreciation of respect for legislation."
"This idea cannot therefore be retained."
"Amendment No 7 stresses the principle of substitution to eliminate risk."
"The Commission is certainly in agreement with this principle, which aims at replacing hazardous chemical agents by others which are not hazardous or which are less hazardous to workers."
"Nevertheless, to encourage optimal preventive action on the part of employers, the most practical obligation to reduce risk to a minimum must be maintained when the complete elimination of all risk is impossible."
"Amendment No 8 is politically delicate."
"It was only after difficult negotiations that the Member States and the Commission came to an agreement on this text."
"As the proposed addition goes beyond the compromise reached and, although the Commission understands Parliament's position, it prefers to keep the text as it is, given that on the basis of Amendment No 4, which can be accepted, it is possible to come back to this question at the time of the five-year evaluation."
"In the case of Amendment No 10, the Commission considers that the withdrawal of the paragraph on the nature of information would not facilitate the task of the employer on this very important point."
"I have one last observation concerning Amendment No 14."
"The Commission cannot accept the removal of the term ""and the new findings' from amongst the cases demanding an adaptation of the annexes to technological progress."
"Indeed, new findings constitute the main reason for technological modifications."
"This principle was, moreover, approved by the Council in its common position and on many other occasions."
"I hope that Parliament will not thus be looking to limit the Commission's rights of initiative."
"It is not a question of the Commission using the pretext of adaptations to technological progress in order to bypass Parliament, as the rapporteur seems to think."
"Regarding Amendments Nos 16 and 17, the Commission is not able to accept them, for it considers that Amendment No 3, which it does accept, is better than Amendment No 16 and that Amendment No 17 adds no further information to Article 8 of the common position."
"Mr President, I heard that Commissioner Cresson had not included Amendment No 11 among the amendments that the Commission was able to adopt."
"However, I have tabled a verbal amendment, in collaboration with the Commission in fact, so I hope the Commission will not retreat at the last moment."
"The arrival of this amendment was somewhat delayed, so I hope this was merely an oversight."
"I fully concur with you - this is also a gentle hint to my colleagues - that there is no reason to vote on Amendment No 16 when the Commission and the Council already accept Amendment No 3."
"We must take care not to hold the banner up so high that we lose our footing on terra firma, so I am actually very happy with your comments. However, I do hope, Mrs Cresson, that you dream tonight that you want to have a hand in reviewing these matters once again, because then we can get a directive through that has been standing still for four years."
"I have bent over backwards, the Council has bent over backwards, and I believe the Commission, too, can come towards us a little."
"I am quite sure that you will dream about this tonight, so we can achieve a positive result tomorrow."
"It will not be long."
"Amendment No 11 is accepted by the Commission, indeed, I believe I said this earlier, but perhaps it is a simple case of a problem of translation."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is questions to the Commission (B4-0017/98)."
"The Commission would remind the author of the question that, according to the provisions of the new Article 255 introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the citizen has the right of access to the documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, subject to the principles and limits the Council has to determine, according to the codecision procedure, within two years of the entry into force of the Treaty."
"On the basis of these general principles which are common to the three institutions, each one should draw up its own regulations on the specific provisions regarding application."
"The Commission will therefore submit a draft legislation, according to the entry into force of the Treaty."
"So far, no decision has been taken on the exceptions to the right of access the Commission should propose."
"Without any doubt, the Commission considers it essential to develop the policy of transparency and access to its documents, but the future legislation on this matter depends on the result of the interinstitutional negotiations."
"Naturally, the declaration included in the final document will be observed, which allows each Member State to ask the Commission or the Council not to disclose a document originating from the country itself without prior permission."
"Mr President, I have three short questions."
"I would like clarification of whether this document will concern all or just three - the most important three - bodies mentioned in the Amsterdam Treaty: the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"Personally, I think it should be a matter for all to consider."
"Next, I would like to ask about very sensitive issues."
"Is it understood that Europe's future central bank should be subordinate to public legislation?"
"In addition, Europol cooperation has proved to be an area where there is a need for more openness."
"Finally, I would like to ask whether the Commission could not put together some sort of Green Paper on the subject of openness so that all bodies, including Parliament, could discuss in broad terms what should be done concerning this document?"
"I think this would be an excellent way to proceed."
"As a general outline to this additional answer, I have to say, Mr Hautala, that the general secretaries of the three Institutions concerned have already held specific meetings to discuss this point and have formed an interinstitutional working party, under the direction of the Commission, which has been given the task of conducting a preliminary study of the problem."
"The working parties have already been set up and the group is currently reflecting on the questions to be dealt with in the proposal for the future legislation."
"I wish to ask you, Mr Hautala, whether it will be applied to the three institutions?"
"As I recalled, according to the provisions of Article 255, it is a question of access to the documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission and there will be general principles common to the three institutions, on the basis of which each of the three institutions will then draw up its own regulations for specific application."
"Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether his studies also cover the internal workings of Parliament, because we have a body, the Conference of Presidents of the various groups, which keeps the Parliamentarians in the dark, and takes all sorts of decisions in secret meetings that we hear nothing about."
"Could this be sorted out?"
"The second thing I wanted to ask is this: what is your attitude to the idea of forcing the European Central Bank to make a public declaration of this kind, which would have the effect of opening the doors to American speculators?."
"It would not take long to wreck our currency then!"
"With regard to the European Central Bank, I have nothing to say, as Article 255 does not refer to this institution."
"With regard to the first question, it seems to me that, as the Member said himself, it relates to the European Parliament's internal documents and it is therefore not up to the Commission to give an opinion in this connection."
"I would like to ask whether the Commission supports the principle of reversing the burden of proof which was passed by a large majority of Parliament in part-session and by the Committee on Institutional Affairs by 34 votes to 0."
"According to this, the basis for any decision must be that the documents and meetings are open, unless a qualified majority of two thirds of those present at Commission meetings, in Parliament or at Council meetings decides that a meeting or document should be closed for good reason."
"In other words, we should reverse the burden of proof, so it takes a qualified majority to close a document."
"Can the Commission support this principle which was passed unanimously by our committees?"
"Thank you for this additional question."
"This is a matter I will bring to the attention of the working party formed by the general secretaries of the three institutions."
"I have no particular information to offer by way of an answer; I therefore take note of it and will pass on the question to the group composed of the three general secretaries."
"Question No 61 by Julio AÃ±overos Trias de Bes (H-0048/98)"
"Subject: Internet and Community Law"
"When will the EuroLaw server be accessible through the Internet?"
"Does the Commission intend to offer free access to the CELEX database on the Web?"
"Do the institutions plan to provide a page providing information for the public on the Community legislative process and on the officials responsible?"
"If so, could the institutions design such a page jointly in order to optimize its usefulness?"
"The EuroLaw server, the provisional name to which the Member refers, will make the whole text of the Official Journals available, both the L and C series, free of charge on the Internet Europa site, which can be found at http: //europa.eu.int, in the 11 official languages of the EU for a period of 20 days."
"This site is currently being prepared: the actual date for its opening should be in the spring of 1998 and will be announced officially by the Official Publications Office of the European Communities."
"The EuroLaw server will enable users to access the following services free of charge and in progression: the list of Community legislation in force, supplemented by the texts of the documents shown in the list by their title alone, as shown in the CELEX data bank; the collection of EU treaties; the consolidated text of the Community legislative documents; the recent judgments of the European Court of Justice; and the COM documents."
"Consequently, all the legislative texts in force will be extracted by CELEX and made available to EuroLaw users free of charge."
"For the time being, however, the Commission is not planning to offer the CELEX data bank for consultation via the Internet free of charge."
"It should be recalled that CELEX offers a very wide range of advanced research possibilities and that the proceeds deriving from consultation of the base are used to finance part of the considerable work of documentary analysis required to give CELEX its specific added value."
"The Commission shares the Member's opinion that it is advisable to inform citizens of the Union's decision-making mechanisms and the functioning of the interinstitutional procedures."
"For this purpose, it plans to present the principal interinstitutional procedures in the form of a diagram, in order to be concise."
"Moreover, to the extent that resources are available and in cooperation with the services of Parliament, the Commission will try to circulate general information on the state of the current procedures, an objective that will be realized, in particular, through modernizing and putting the APC system that is already accessible to the public on the Internet."
"Mr President, I do not want to put a supplementary question, but just to say that the Commissioner gave a very full reply, for which I am extremely grateful."
"I thank the Commissioner for his answer."
"I would like to put one more question: when is it going to be clear that through this EuroLaw link people will be able to see how far the Member States have incorporated the law into national legislation?"
"We currently have an experiment as far as Finnish legislation is concerned, but what does the Commissioner think of the possibilities of getting information about the situation in all Member States through the same service?"
"In addition, I think it is important that in future this server has the technology to make it easy to see what is news, so-called 'push technology' , which your colleague Commissioner Oreja has promised to consider, and which I hope can be implemented very soon."
"I believe that for easier use it is important that people also get news quickly."
"I would like to say to Mr Thors that it had been hoped that the EuroLaw server would be available immediately on the Internet."
"This is not possible. To do that, preliminary adaptations need to be made to all the technical devices, particularly those of the Publications Office; everything will be ready in a few months' time."
"We understand the urgency and importance of this tool and every effort will be made to make it available as soon as possible."
"I will take this opportunity, and the specific question raised by Mr Thors on the importance to the citizen of knowing whether the Member States have included the Community regulations, to indicate another information tool."
"In the wide range of material on the internal market, since November 1997 the Commission has been publishing a scoreboard, a periodic report, that indicates the situation of each Member State as regards the inclusion of directives, the observance of infringement procedures, and so on; this scoreboard is already available on the Internet."
"As you can see, we are certainly heading in the direction rightly hoped for by Mr Thors with all the means available."
"Question No 62 by Ian White (H-0112/98)"
"Subject: First-weight mail rates"
"Would the Commission indicate which EU Member States currently link costs of first-weight correspondence, usually 20 g letters, for domestic and internal (within the EU) mail?"
"At present, the current UK rate is the same for first-weight mail, but there are proposals for this to change."
"Would the UK postal services be acting contrary to Article 6 by charging more for non-domestic internal first-weight mail?"
"In around half the Member States of the European Union, there is a unified tariff for sending correspondence at national and intra-Community level in the faster standard category belonging to the first-weight group."
"In the other Member States, tariffs vary according to the destination, usually depending on whether it is national or intraCommunity correspondence."
"Directive 97/67/EC on postal services states that the prices of each of the services forming part of the supply of the universal service should be correlated with costs."
"This obligation applies to all the correspondence in question, whether national or intraCommunity."
"This could encourage some Member States to rectify the current charging system for their own postal services to that effect."
"The Treaty establishing the European Community, and particularly Article 6, does not prohibit a similar tariff differentiation provided it is commensurate with costs, as laid down by the aforesaid Directive 97/67/EC."
"I think it would be useful for me to explain the background of the question to the Commissioner."
"A change in pricing to the structure of the international tariff within the United Kingdom is proposed from 6 April this year."
"At present the first-weight rate charge is the same for domestic and EU post."
"The proposal is for domestic post to stay at 26p but for EU post to increase to 30p."
"There is also a proposal that the non-EU rate be decreased from 31p to 30p which effectively classes the EU alongside all other foreign post."
"I would submit that is contrary to Article 6 and therefore there is a responsibility upon the Commission to ask for an explanation from the United Kingdom postal authorities on this point."
"Can you please reply in detail?"
"I wish to thank Mr White for further clarifying the context of his question."
"There may actually be an apparent contradiction between single tariff and price correlated with costs, but it is only an apparent contradiction."
"Article 12 of the Directive on postal services states, on the one hand, that prices shall be correlated with costs and, on the other, that the Member States may decide whether to apply a single tariff to the entire national territory."
"These two statements may seem to be contradictory."
"However, the obligation on the correlation of costs does not imply a total coincidence between price and cost and leaves the Member State the possibility of applying a system of making tariffs equal for specific provisions of the universal service."
"I would add that applying a tariff distinction based on costs between national and intra-Community post or, possibly, between post to different Member States, does not constitute an infringement of Article 6 of the Treaty, as such a distinction is not based on nationality but rather on the criterion of the actual cost the provision of different services entails."
"Question No 63 by Anne Van Lancker (H-0114/98)"
"Subject: Preparations for integrating the Schengen acquis in the Treaty"
"According to the Treaty, the Schengen measures on checks at external borders, asylum, immigration and judicial cooperation in civil matters should come under Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, while the provisions on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters should come under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, the third pillar."
"In the Commission's view, what should the SIS (and later the EIS) come under?"
"Article 286 of the Treaty says that from 1 January 1999 Community decisions on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing and free movement of personal data shall apply to the institutions and bodies set up by, or on the basis of, the Treaty."
"What arrangements should there be for the protection of privacy in the SIS?"
"Will Article 286 also apply to personal data gathered under third pillar initiatives?"
"The question raised by Mrs Van Lancker is fundamental in nature and requires a brief but comprehensive answer."
"The principle of the integration of the Schengen acquis into the EU has been sanctioned in the protocol attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"To achieve this integration, various measures have been adopted, including the decision by the Council, as provided for in paragraph 1 of Article 2 of the protocol, based on the relevant provisions of the Treaties, establishing the legal basis for each of the provisions or decisions constituting the Schengen acquis."
"Pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty on European Union currently in force, the distribution of the Schengen acquis between the first and the third pillars would have been a very difficult task on account of the unclear distinction between the areas of competence of the two pillars mentioned."
"However, the Treaty of Amsterdam provides greater clarity and the distribution should not raise too many problems."
"As regards, in particular, the division of the provisions on the Schengen Information System, the Commission considers that a dual legal base should be established in relation to the first and third pillars."
"In fact, the Schengen Information System collects data relating to both the first and third pillars."
"Article 96 of the Schengen Agreement, on the categories of aliens to be refused entry, refers to external frontier controls and visa and immigration policy and therefore to data belonging to the first pillar."
"Other categories of data, such as definitions provided for extradition purposes, unquestionably fall under police and legal cooperation in criminal matters and therefore come under the third pillar."
"The establishment of a dual legal base should not be detrimental to the operation of the Schengen Information System."
"The dual legal base is not something new."
"The Customs Information System is also based on a regulation from the first pillar and an agreement from the third pillar based on the same text."
"With regard to specific Schengen provisions on data protection within the scope of the Schengen Information System, a dual legal base should be established, comprising the first and third pillars."
"The same regulations should be applied to data protection with regard to sectors coming under the first and third pillars, in the exchange of information through the SIS."
"Finally, the question as to whether Article 286 of the EC Treaty will be applied to the Schengen Information System has not yet been resolved."
"I would like to start by thanking the Commissioner for his interpretation."
"I think it agrees fully with my own. The necessary instruments for the implementation of the new Community pillar with regards to free movement of people cannot come under the third pillar."
"But, Mr Commissioner, I am getting strong indications from the Council, and not only from one Member State within the Council, but from several of them, that the Council has a completely different opinion. It seems that someone in the Council is saying quite forcefully that the entire Schengen Information System, and therefore also the European Information System, should come under the third pillar, with all its consequences for parliamentary and judicial control and for the European Commission's right of legislative initiative in this rather delicate affair."
"Can the Commissioner tell me which arguments, legal and political, the Commission can produce to win over the Council, and that it will not start fiddling with the adequate legal base which must be used in this matter so that the Schengen Protocol might be properly categorized?"
"I have to say that current efforts and the work I have briefly described is ongoing, despite being complex."
"In the declaration relating to Article 2 of the Schengen Protocol, the Member States agree that the Council should take all the necessary measures laid down by Article 2 as well as that relating therefore to the distribution just mentioned, by the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"For this purpose, it establishes that the preparatory work should begin in good time to be completed before that date."
"I have to say that, after the signing of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Luxembourg Presidency began work within the Council and that the current British Presidency has taken it over immediately."
"Various meetings are already planned to observe the timetable which has been established."
"Some results have already been achieved, and this allows us to believe that the deadlines will be observed."
"We therefore have no reason to be pessimistic."
"I well understand the Member's concern, but it is obvious that the Commission has taken an active and constructive part in the Council's work on this matter, to ensure that the integration of the Schengen acquis, within the scope of the European Union, takes place in full compliance with the law of the European Community and the European Union."
"It seems obvious to me that the European Parliament is involved in distributing the Schengen acquis, as this distribution will establish the legal base for future proposals seeking to amend the Schengen acquis and therefore relates to Parliament's role with regard to these future proposals."
"I therefore propose that the Council duly submits to the European Parliament the draft decision on the distribution of the Schengen acquis."
"My question about the Schengen Information System concerns the supervisory function of the JSA, the Joint Supervisory Authority ."
"This authority is responsible for checking that the rules which exist for this system are respected."
"The first report issued by this supervisory authority pointed out major defects in the SIS system, including inaccurate information on those registered."
"In addition, it states that there is different information about the same people in different parts of the SIS database."
"The JSA also emphasizes that it has totally inadequate resources to carry out the investigation it wants, including budgetary resources and resources for translation."
"It also underlines that it has been denied access to the SIS computer here in Strasbourg on at least one occasion when it has tried to carry out an on-site inspection with its experts."
"My question is whether the Commission intends to strengthen the JSA's budgetary resources and authority to carry out its work."
"Is it the Commission's opinion that this should happen?"
"With regard to the Joint Supervisory Authority, the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam naturally has to be dealt with. However, with regard to the other aspects of the question, I believe that only the actual bodies involved in the Schengen Convention are in the best position to give more thorough answers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think it has become clear how closely connected Title IV of the EC Treaty and Title VI of the EU Treaty are."
"I would like to ask you about the connection between the issue of external borders, which is dealt with in one, and the issue of fighting organized crime, which is dealt with in the other."
"I think we really need to proceed with the Schengen Information System accordingly and see the connection between the two."
"Your comment highlights the very purpose of these constructions: to provide space for freedom of movement and at the same time space for security."
"Schengen arose within this perspective and is operating within this perspective; its incorporation into the Treaty of Amsterdam is also moving decidedly within this perspective."
"The information structures should reflect this fundamental dual objective."
"Question No 64 by Graham Watson (H-0147/98)"
"Subject: Ticket allocation system for the 1998 football World Cup"
"The French authorities have proposed a ticket allocation system for the 1998 football World Cup which limits worldwide sales for matches to just 40 % of total tickets, while 60 % of tickets will be restricted to the French market."
"In view of the precedent set by the ""Cassis de Dijon' judgment, does the Commission agree that the proposed ticket allocation is a fundamental breach of internal market legislation?"
"Does the Commission have plans to investigate the proposed ticket sales operation?"
"Mr President, the French organizing committee of the World Cup at first envisaged a system of ticket distribution based on territorial exclusiveness which would essentially not have permitted the sale of tickets in other Member States of the European Union."
"It also envisaged linking ticket sales to other services such as accommodation and travel."
"Following an approach by the European Commission, the organizing committee agreed to make changes which would enable both specific tour operators and travel agencies firstly, to sell either tickets alone or packages of services, and secondly, to sell them in other countries. This ensures competition between various distributors throughout the European Union."
"After complaints in the press regarding the infringement of European rules of competition so far as the sale of tickets for the football World Cup 1998 was concerned, the Commission has approached the French organizing committee and five tour operators selected for the sale of tickets in the UEFA area."
"Replies to those letters are being awaited and we believe that when we receive them the Commission will be able to form a complete picture of how the French organizing committee set about distributing tickets, and to ascertain whether and to what extent the rules of competition have been contravened."
"If Community law has been infringed, that will most probably be due to contravention of the European rules of competition, mainly Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, rather than an infringement of the law in relation to the Cassis de Dijon affair mentioned by the Member, which covers the elimination of quota restrictions on imports between the Member States pursuant to Article 30 of the Treaty."
"At any rate, no such infringement has so far been confirmed where the distribution of tickets for the football World Cup 1998 is concerned."
"Thank you very much, Mr Papoutsis."
"Mr Watson, the Rules of Procedure do not include any rule prohibiting Members from bringing a ball into the Chamber, but I assume there is no trademark or any subliminal advertising on that beautiful football which I can see from here."
"In any case, you have the floor to question the Commissioner for one minute."
"I assure you that I have no intention to kick this football in the Chamber but it is an excellent example of a souvenir World Cup football."
"I am grateful to the Commissioner for his answer."
"Clearly under Article 7a of the Single European Act, and indeed under Article 85, it must be held that any product lawfully put on sale in one part of the Union cannot be barred from being imported into any other."
"Indeed, the Commission has just fined Volkswagen some Â£68 million for breach of this principle."
"It is my information that the French authorities are preventing ticket agencies and tour operators from selling tickets outside France."
"A ticket, for example, for the Brazil v Scotland match which would cost Â£50 in France, has been on sale on the black market in Britain for nearly Â£800."
"Did the French authorities consult the Commission before making their arrangements?"
"Does the Commissioner not agree that this is outrageous and does he not agree that it contravenes EU principles?"
"Will he take action against France if it is found to be in breach of the Treaties?"
"Mr President, first of all let me tell you that the ball at the front of Mr Watson's bench reminds me of my childhood years, when I too had the chance to engage in this wonderful sport."
"I would, however, like to make some comments on what Mr Watson said."
"As I mentioned before, we are waiting for replies to the letters we sent to the tour operators and the French authorities."
"So far, we have no information confirming the accusations that a specific infringement is indeed taking place."
"What I must say, however, as a general principle, is that the Commission believes that competition among the various suppliers and products certainly benefits the consumer compared with a system of exclusive distribution and committed ticket sales."
"We will insist that the rules of competition must be applied, and we believe we will be successful."
"The next item is a continuation of the joint debate on air pollution by motor vehicles."
"Mr President, I should start by saying that the Commissioners' speech gives me the feeling that, unfortunately, there is still very little room for dialogue on these directives between the Commission and Council, on the one hand, and Parliament, on the other, and therefore, unfortunately, we cannot find the openings we were expecting."
"However, I believe, as has been said, that the high number of deaths and serious harm caused by air pollution, largely due to vehicle traffic - think of the damage caused by acid rain - mean that we need clear, fast decisions, even if we are convinced that we cannot solve the problem just by concentrating on petrol and vehicles."
"But above all, we need initiatives encouraging, for example, group transportation, switching passengers and goods to less polluting means of transport. These are all things that are not included in these measures but which, if not pursued, would make it difficult to achieve the objective."
"With regard to the two directives in question, the Greens certainly share the problems raised by the rapporteurs and the solutions proposed in their reports."
"We believe, in particular, that the level of sulphur in petrol should be reduced, the quantity of aromatics and polyaromatics reduced to non-hazardous values, that lead should be totally eliminated and, with regard to vehicle systems, that a system providing on-board diagnostics should be introduced for all vehicles."
"However, it should certainly not be said that the measures to be taken before 2000 are too soon and should be postponed to 2005 and then say that they are not compulsory: either they are compulsory or they are meaningless!"
"Mr President, this afternoon we were talking about the Kyoto Summit and CO2 emissions."
"The debate we are going to have now has a lot to do with what we were talking about this afternoon."
"In fact, in the Commission's communication on the Kyoto Summit issued at the end of 1997, reference was made to those sectors which produce the most CO2 - one of the most dangerous greenhouse gases - and it was clearly stated that unless measures are taken, CO2 emissions from transport will increase by 31 % by 2010."
"So that is what we are going to talk about now."
"I think the rapporteur has the right approach."
"He envisages globally integrated measures - in other words, not just using more advanced techniques for engine production, but considering aspects such as better quality fuel, traffic management, the promotion of public transport - which is being neglected -, trans-European transport networks and alternative fuels."
"In other words, he proposes a series of integrated measures which are very important to bear in mind."
"The report also says that an improvement in fuel quality would have immediate effects if it were brought in - more so than actual progress in engine production - because it would affect all the cars currently in use in Europe. As the rapporteur rightly says, in some countries - such as my own, Spain - most cars are old and would be very expensive to upgrade."
"Finally, Mr President, I think this Parliament needs a clear majority to approve these reports tomorrow. Parliament will have more say in the codecision process if its position is firm and clear, like the one approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"Mr President, this Auto-Oil Programme is nearing its completion."
"When the standards for 2005 are laid down in a binding way, industry will be given clarification."
"On that point I fully agree with both rapporteurs."
"Binding standards for 2005, both for vehicles and fuels, are absolutely necessary."
"Substantial investments will indeed have to be made, but technically it can all be achieved and it is vital for air quality."
"Only on the point of the NOx catalytic converter, however, is some patience needed."
"Amendment No 28 which will reduce the sulphur content to 100 ppm in 2000 strikes me as very realistic."
"Once the catalytic converter is in production, low sulphur fuel should at least also be available."
"I wholeheartedly support the amendments on on-board diagnostics and cold starts."
"I also support a durability test after ten years."
"I read that there is some movement on the CO2 demands, even though it does not sound particularly positive."
"Now that the emissions of heavy polluting chemicals have been pushed back considerably, it is all the more pertinent to push back the use of fuel in general, especially since it is being demonstrated that with small technological improvements, large fuel savings can be made."
"I would draw your attention to the fly wheel vehicle which manages a reduction of 20 %, and the developments in the fivelitre car."
"Is the Commission considering binding legislation at European level?"
"We believe the time is ripe for this."
"That way the Kyoto agreements might be achieved."
"Mr President, the dawn of the next millennium will finally see the start of a European road transport policy aimed at combating the problems of air pollution caused by road traffic. If we had to measure its effectiveness, bearing in mind the large number of measures planned, we would certainly be more than optimistic."
"The joint programme drawn up by the Commission and by the motor and oil industries of the Auto-Oil Union has defined a strategy aimed at reducing vehicle gas emissions to improve air quality, establishing two deadlines: 2000 and 2005, the dates by which the quality of fuels and the limit values of emissions should be defined."
"With regard to the two reports being discussed, drawn up by Mr Hautala and Mr Lange, the important points of the entire Auto-Oil programme indicate a subtle contradiction between the fact that improving the quality of fuels will have immediate effects both on new and older vehicles and the fact that establishing limit values and improving engines should, however, only concern new vehicles."
"We would like to establish three priorities: firstly, to combine respect for the environment with respect for work and research in industry; secondly, to establish the final system by 2005; and thirdly, to firmly establish the principle that the ""polluter pays' , providing tax incentives for anyone investing with a view to improving quality."
"We too believe that the marketing of leaded petrol should be prohibited in all Member States by 2000, apart from the fact that this would lead to some economic problems which, we believe, could be prevented by intervening now."
"In any case, we should start with Council's decision to fix compulsory values by 2000 and indicative values by 2005."
"With regard to diesel fuel, we accept the proposal made by the Chairman of PSA CitroÃ«n-Peugeot, who recently pointed out the possibility of using biofuels at no extra cost to the motor industry, particularly dister, a highly concentrated, environmentally friendly diesel oil."
"Important factors in the campaign to reduce emissions include: better engine design, better technical control, more frequent inspections and recourse to new types of fuel, together with more attentive management of traffic and public transport."
"We believe that a whole series of new technologies could be developed to combat pollution effectively: I am referring, for example, to the fitting of on-board diagnostics systems."
"We also believe it important to improve on the directive on CO2 emissions caused by vehicles, which is currently at a stalemate, together with the proposal to establish a system of tax incentives, that should not mean new taxation but rather an inspection and more effective check of existing ones."
"Mr President, all citizens - not just a select few - have the right to breathe clean air and protect their health."
"This view, and the increase in air pollution due to our traffic using two fuels, led the European Parliament to vote unanimously at first reading for the amendment to this directive to improve the quality of the air we breathe."
"The European Parliament's position and the right to good health, as provided for by the Treaty of Amsterdam, were undeniably echoed by the Council, although that echo is still inadequate since it only takes the form of indicative limit values."
"So we are sure that despite the hard-hearted pressure to which they have subjected us, some petrochemical companies will make the necessary investments - as the automobile sector has already done - so that they can offer better quality fuels when the health of their shareholders and clients, and of course the citizens as well, forces them to do so."
"It would be a serious matter if private interests were to take precedence over the quality of the air we breathe, especially after the Kyoto Summit. We have all noticed the alarming increase in air pollution in urban areas."
"Some cities, such as Paris, Athens and Bologna, have even had to ban traffic on occasion in order to provide a solution to this serious health problem. And I think it is important to emphasize that some of these cities are located in the south of the Union."
"Rule 2 of our Rules of Procedure says: ""Members of the European Parliament shall exercise their mandate independently."
"Accordingly therefore, and exercising my own personal responsibility, I shall vote in favour of Mrs Hautala's report - in favour, that is, of health and the environment."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although Commissioner Bangemann has already gone, I would not like him to get a surprise in the Conciliation Committee."
"We are not just talking about the same old proposals for amendments - we too are impressed by how far the Council has moved away from the Commission's position."
"I think that is a good sign for the conciliation process."
"There is nothing new about attempts to reduce emissions of pollutants from motor vehicles."
"A lot of progress has been made in recent years, but not enough."
"Complicated measures will be required to ensure unlimited mobility for our citizens in the future, and that is my particular concern."
"That is why I welcome the approach adopted in the Auto-Oil programme before us today."
"There are two sides to this: first, optimizing vehicle technology so that pollutants are reduced; and second, improving fuel quality so that pollutants are totally eliminated or are reduced, as well as facilitating the introduction of modern engine technology."
"The Auto-Oil programme was the first time that had happened, and it is unfortunate that the original cooperation between the oil industry and the automotive industry is not continued in the Commission's proposal. It is actually very important for these two European industrial sectors to work together, given that the competitiveness of European industry is at stake."
"So it has to be reiterated that a legislative approach must be adopted to make progress."
"It is really a truism to say that improved fuels are needed to reduce emissions from the existing motor vehicle fleet and to ease the introduction of fuel-efficient engine technology in the future."
"This House made its position on this quite clear at first reading."
"What I find totally incomprehensible is the attitude of some parts of the European oil industry, which is fighting tooth and nail against significant fuel improvements."
"It claims that it would involve high costs for the oil industry with little benefit for the environment."
"Both claims are wrong."
"The most recent calculations indicate that the cost of desulphurizing fuels and other measures are by no means as high as originally assumed, and it will be passed on to the consumer anyway."
"I would just like to point out what is involved."
"We are talking about just ECU 0.004 per litre for petrol and 0.009 per litre for diesel, based on the strict limits at first reading."
"So what are the environmental advantages?"
"They are certainly enormous."
"One European car manufacturer recently tested its vehicles in California, where fuels that comply with these limits are already on the market."
"The result was a reduction of about 40 % in hydrocarbon emissions and about 30 % in NOx emissions."
"I would call that a major environmental benefit."
"It is not fair to threaten refinery closures because of the Auto-Oil programme."
"A new Commission study has confirmed what is already well-known among specialists: there is over-capacity in Europe's refineries, and this is a structural problem."
"At present, the oil industry is investing outside Europe."
"Demand for clean fuels would bring this investment back to Europe and guarantee the competitiveness of this sector in Europe, and that is something we all want."
"Although the compromise proposal is very much a backward step compared with the first reading, I still firmly support it, particularly as regards the mandatory values for 2005."
"Mr Florenz has already said today that industry has to invest."
"We know that."
"It needs to invest money."
"But we can give it a guarantee that this money will be well invested, instead of letting them invest with 2000 in mind and then suddenly coming up with totally different values, so that their investment has been wasted."
"We cannot be a party to anything like that, and it is not this Parliament's intention in any case."
"Of course, technically speaking it would be possible to go a lot further than we are proposing here."
"It remains to be seen whether the legal framework is adequate to achieve everything that is necessary and feasible."
"If not, the report before us also allows for further improvement."
"Maybe you will take that as a warning."
"Mr President, thank you and welcome to the Commissioner."
"I want to thank both of the rapporteurs for their input in this very important area."
"I also have to declare an interest in this matter because Ireland's only oil refinery is placed in my constituency of Munster, my home county of Cork, and they have approached me with very serious concerns regarding some of the proposals put forward."
"However, there are a few things that I want to point out."
"Firstly, we must of course - and I think all Members in this Parliament agree - have the best possible environment for each of our citizens to allow them to have full freedom of health and safety."
"Any actions that we can take here must seek to enforce best practices and ideas."
"Secondly, we also have a duty to ensure that the working environment and the ability to compete and to get a job within our Community is also made available and is as accessible as possible."
"Looking at some of the suggestions with regard to the maximum levels permitted under the reports, if you just take Ireland as one example, the air quality in Dublin, the capital city, is already meeting the standards that are set down within this report."
"Cork city, where I come from, is 50 % better than Dublin and the rest of Ireland, rural Ireland we call it, is 10 % better still."
"Surely imposing a European directive and a Europe-wide legislation will seriously impact on these areas, as Members have already admitted there is a cost factor built into this: costs that will be passed on directly to the consumer and costs that will affect our industrial capacity as well as affecting our competitive edge."
"To overcome this, Members have suggested that we bring in differential tax incentives to give encouragement and so on."
"How does this marry with the idea of the single market?"
"Rather than taking up any more time, I would like to say that I will be voting against the reports tomorrow and I hope that through conciliation we can reach a more reasonable suggestion."
"Mr President, our whole present disposable lifestyle is a threat to future generations, and continued automatization poses a threat to climactic stability."
"Vehicle emissions must be cut by every possible means."
"Work must be done at their source, with the development of the combustible engine."
"Fuels must be improved."
"It is important now to develop viable catalytic convertors for diesel fuels and to improve their quality."
"The European oil industry represents the old smokestack capitalism, based on the exploitation of human beings and the destruction of nature and the environment."
"The oil industry, though not all companies, opposes limitations on emissions, saying that new investment would have to be found for them."
"The industry is acting as if it had to meet these new costs itself."
"We all know, however, that investment always ends up with the consumer having to pay."
"But it is the polluter who should pay."
"That would result in just a minute rise in the price of fuel."
"If the polluter does not pay, it is the people who are getting sick who pay."
"Even if the European oil industry is not proving competitive, the costs of investment should not get passed on to the consumer."
"It is the European Parliament's duty to refuse to ensure the survival of the oil industry by subsidizing poor quality oil."
"Any oil industry which cannot sell its products except at the cost of the pollution of the natural world deserves to go bust."
"Mr President, I think it is vital that both Mr Lang and Mrs Hautala's reports be approved."
"It is important if we wish to improve air quality."
"Mr President, it is important to remember that, basically, the Auto-Oil programme is about improving the environment and human health."
"Many studies have shown that air pollution affects people's health."
"So there is a direct link between increasing mortality and air pollution caused by road traffic."
"These studies clearly show that clear limits must be set on motor vehicle emissions, and clear standards must be set for petrol quality."
"This means it is important that the levels should be binding, and not merely indicative."
"Fixed standards are the only realistic way of achieving the air quality desired."
"For the same reason, it is important to limit the exceptions to the standards to the absolute minimum necessary."
"This does not mean, of course, that we should ignore the economic aspects."
"New technology and higher standards mean increased costs, but the first thing to do is to look at all the relevant variables."
"Cost-effectiveness cannot be the only basis for assessing individual mechanisms."
"We must assess cost-effectiveness in the light of the improvements and savings to society as a whole."
"So I agree that the directive's proposals should include the solutions which are best for the citizens' health as well as for the economy."
"Experience from California also shows that the Commission's estimates exaggerate the costs which would be involved in the new petrol quality standards and emission limits."
"I believe it would encourage innovation if demands were made on industry."
"Hopefully, the directive concerned will encourage the industry to develop vehicles running on renewable sources of energy."
"I can therefore heartily support the Council's joint approach to all the amendments the Committee on the Environment has made."
"Mr President, in ecological terms Mrs Hautala and Mr Lange's reports certainly constitute a shining hour in Parliament's history."
"What might at first sight appear to be a handicap for the automotive industry is in practice a great opportunity."
"It was the same with the catalytic converter: people originally said it would be the downfall of the car industry, but in fact it resulted in technical progress."
"By sticking to its old position, the Commission is spoiling the prospects for constructive dialogue, which would be a vital opportunity."
"So the car will remain the number one environmental enemy."
"The debate about the true costs of road traffic will have to be stepped up."
"Parliament has offered a solution, but unfortunately it has not been accepted."
"If there is a confrontation, there will be no winners, neither the environment nor the car or oil industries."
"There will just be losers, which is a great pity."
"While Parliament will certainly pass the elk test tomorrow, in my view the Commission has already failed it."
"Mr President, Parliament made the right choice at first reading."
"It enabled the Commission's position to be significantly developed since the Council was making somewhat more favourable proposals."
"We can go further though and this is what our citizens expect."
"Every day we see in the papers that town pollution is on the increase and that the greenhouse effect is threatening us."
"It is now imprinted on the collective conscience that we can use technological progress to resolve these problems of civilization, quality of life and health of our people."
"It is therefore essential that restrictive and strict standards be set for the year 2005 because this will be an advantage for the automobile industry."
"Of course the manufacturers are somewhat hesitant, but they must understand that the credibility of the motor vehicle rests precisely on the possibility of having standards in line with our expectations."
"It is all the more important that the European automobile market understands one difficulty, that is, the replacement of the stock of cars on the road."
"Only clean, safe cars can legitimize renewing the number of cars on the road, and thus reviving employment in this sector."
"We also know that the question of cars already on the road, which has been raised by many colleagues, is essential."
"From this point of view, the efforts demanded of the oil industry are essential, for there are a large number of older cars. I hope that Europe will also consider ways for a speedier removal of older cars from our roads, bearing in mind that they often belong to poorer people."
"We need a Community strategy to speed up this transformation of the older rolling stock."
"Finally, the environment is not the enemy of employment: the evolution of the car is an opportunity for the car industry!"
"The oil companies, which are blackmailing us over the refineries, have accumulated considerable profits over the years, profits which must be reinvested in order to modernize their industry for the general interest."
"They must not then hide behind the environmental question to justify the closures which they had - unfortunately - planned, whatever we decide today."
"Mr President, we in Parliament can note with pleasure that the Council has tightened up the Commission's original proposal on important points and moved in the direction of Parliament's position."
"On the other hand, the majority on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection supported Mrs Hautala's modifications concerning fuel."
"These amendments were sensible considering the short time remaining until implementation in the year 2000."
"It is important to stimulate technical development towards more advanced exhaust gas purification technology and towards more fuel-efficient engines by guaranteeing access to fuel with a very low sulphur content until the year 2005."
"During the transition period we would then also see a substantial improvement with regard to emissions from older vehicles."
"This is quite simply a short cut to better air quality."
"On the other hand, I think that the Committee on the Environment has gone too far with regard to aromatics in petrol in the year 2000."
"On this point I think the Council has a more realistic approach."
"In a large number of modern refineries there is a conflict between sulphur requirements and aromatics requirements."
"From the environmental point of view the sulphur requirement is much more important and should therefore be given priority."
"In addition, modern catalytic converter technology takes care of the aromatics."
"It is also important for Member States to be allowed to take a lead and to have the right to use economic means of control to improve the environment."
"In large parts of Sweden a fuel is used which meets the requirements being made for the year 2005. I can guarantee that the environment has been manifestly improved where this fuel has been used."
"It is also easy to use economic means of control and to prevent them from being used in such a way that competition is restricted."
"Finally, it is pleasing to note that the development towards cars with zero emissions is moving so quickly."
"We can see them, not only as a vision, but also as a reality."
"Mr President, the European Parliament will today give its opinion on two proposals for directives in which there is a considerable amount at stake, for the environment, for industry and for employment."
"Our position must therefore achieve a fair balance between the desire to improve air quality and to promote new technologies, as well as our desire to maintain competitiveness and employment in the European vehicle and oil industries."
"Firstly, reasonable time limits must be defined to allow industry to adapt to the new standards. Secondly, we need to know if controls greater than those strictly necessary would not cause exactly the opposite effects to the ones we are hoping for, in particular an increase in cars, thus provoking an ageing of the cars on the road and a worsening of pollution and safety risks, along with economic difficulties for the manufacturers."
"The Council's position already seemed to be an improvement in relation to that of the Commission."
"Parliament is calling for more severe standards and it seems as though some of them can be accepted by the Council."
"It is therefore possible to find a satisfactory balance which is not maximalist and which shows that Parliament knows how to fulfil its responsibilities, both at environmental and industrial level."
"Mr President, economic arguments have long prevailed in debates on this subject."
"On the one hand, the oil industry, with highly disparate technical and financial conditions between the countries of the South and North and, on the other, the automobile industry, bombard us with their arguments."
"We, however, would like to concentrate on the issue of the environment and public health."
"Air quality is essential to public health: 7 to 10 % of cases of respiratory disease in children and 19 % of cases of pulmonary illnesses are but a few figures that may be attributed to air pollution."
"It has been proved that the excessively high concentrations of particles in the air originating from lead reduce children's intelligence levels."
"In some European capitals, the speed limit is reduced in response to air pollution, when traffic is not banned completely."
"We wish here to demonstrate and express our support for the position of the Committee on the Environment because this problem also exists in southern Europe."
"But we would like to concentrate primarily on three main points."
"Firstly, we must combat leaded petrol: it must urgently be eliminated."
"The Union and Member States should launch a major information campaign to make citizens aware of the environmental advantages of unleaded petrol."
"Secondly, we need to defending the establishment of binding emission values by the year 2005, contrary to the position of the Council and of the oil industry, because this is the only way to seriously commit the industry to an environmental contract with society as a whole."
"We should also leave the matter of maximum values for sulphur emission for negotiation with the Council, during conciliation procedures. This is because we acknowledge that there are cases, such as in Portugal, where the absence of environmental investment in the sector has caused the postponement of reforms that are today proving to be unavoidable."
"Mr President, we face a challenge here today."
"Can Parliament coherently defend public health and the environment, maintaining the values of the quality of fuels and continuing to call for better technology in motor vehicles, as stated in the Hautala and Lange reports adopted by the Committee on the Environment? Or will we give in to the numerous pressures from the economic sectors involved?"
"I do not dispute that what we are requesting here implies financial and research efforts by the oil and automobile industries."
"But it cannot be denied that air pollution in our cities, including Lisbon and Oporto, frequently reaches levels that threaten public health, and that recent studies confirm that the lead content in children's blood in risk zones and in urban areas exceeds admissible levels."
"There is no doubt that particles, benzine, and other pollutants produced by automobile combustion are highly cancerogenic."
"Therefore, we need better cars and better fuels, particularly in view of the fact that no significant technological improvement is possible with the current content of sulphur in petrol and diesel. This is true both for the introduction of a new generation of catalytic converters, or a new generation of engines, such as direct injection for petrol, which has significantly lower consumption which can fall below 25 % in the urban cycle."
"Lower consumption means lower spending for consumers, less pollution and less CO2 emissions - the main gas responsible for climate change."
"Hence, the calculated annual costs of ESC 1 000 per motor vehicle, and ESC 1 800 per diesel vehicle may not even apply, as a result of the technological evolution leading to the production of better cars with lower consumption."
"It should also be emphasized that better fuels immediately mean less pollution, since even today's cars will function better and produce lower emissions."
"The individual cases of CEPSA, REPSOL and PETROGAL cannot force the whole of Europe, and particularly the Spanish and Portuguese populations, to continue to breath health-threatening, polluted air."
"If these companies experience particular problems, then it is up to their respective governments to negotiate covenants with them which define time frames and mechanisms."
"As a Member of Parliament, I am ready to analyse with an open mind any requests for derogation that may be submitted to me."
"However, I cannot hesitate in defending the Huatala and Lange reports which are the only possible way of reconciling conflicting interests in a manner which allows this Parliament democratically to state its position in defending the rights of Europe's citizens."
"Mr President, although we aim, reasonably and justifiably, to lessen the need for traffic, especially car traffic, in transport and regional planning, the unpleasant truth is that the number of cars in Europe, and more particularly globally, is going to grow."
"This means increased risk to vulnerable nature and people's health."
"Against this background the Auto-Oil programme is most welcome."
"The European Parliament at first reading clearly took a more progressive position than the Commission on which targets for exhaust emissions should be met by the years 2000 and 2005."
"Only binding targets on emissions are valid."
"The recommendations of the Council do not put enough pressure on the European oil industry to develop their technology to produce better and cleaner products."
"Nor has the Council yet understood the power of tax incentives, which encourage consumers to use better quality fuel."
"In any case, this has already happened, and with good results."
"Employment is an issue in Europe."
"Slowing down the adoption of cleaner technology will not serve to aid employment."
"It might go the other way."
"Consumer demand favours those refineries which make environmentally friendly products."
"Unless these products are available in Europe, other companies and products from outside may come to dominate European markets."
"The effects on employment of this are unfathomable."
"We must ensure that we remain competitive and that oil products in Europe are of the highest quality."
"Mr President, we are all concerned about air quality."
"Now we are asking the vehicle and oil industries to make an effort."
"Let us look first at the vehicle manufacturers."
"For the past thirty years we have been asking them to make significant efforts, and they have contributed some 90 % to the improvement of air quality in terms of their vehicles' emissions."
"Now we are asking them to comply with even more stringent controls."
"I am more in favour of the common position, considering that the constraints imposed it are already significant."
"In my opinion the figures must be made compulsory so that our industries can be clear on the issue and define their strategies for development accordingly."
"I therefore believe that it is particularly important that the measures be made compulsory by the year 2005."
"But technological developments in the area of car manufacture will not be able to truly bear fruit unless there is a manifest improvement in the quality of fuel."
"In this respect, it is absolutely necessary that the oil companies make the necessary efforts."
"Up until now, it is not they who have participated most in the improvement of air quality."
"It is thus important that the oil companies make an effort to reduce the level of sulphur, amongst other things."
"We know it is essential for the nitrogen oxide catalytic converter, and in my opinion this is particularly important."
"That is why I wish to support fully and vote for the Hautala report, because it seems to me completely incoherent to call for efforts from the vehicle industry and not to ask for significant efforts on the part of the oil industry in order to make the new technologies completely effective."
"That is all I wanted to say."
"May I add that if fuel is improved, we will immediately see the short-term effects, since this will concern all vehicles and we will immediately note improvements in air quality."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the car is part of our freedom."
"We do not want to give it up, and the car is essential for our economy."
"But it is a very young means of transport, still at the beginning of its life cycle."
"For me, it is fascinating what the car industry is already capable of."
"The competition to get a better and more environmentally friendly car on the market first, the car of the future, is enormous."
"However, it is certainly not our job as Members of Parliament to protect the automotive industry in its efforts to produce cars despite the impact on the market and the health of our population."
"I also find it fascinating that Renault's exhaust gas expert, Mr Hublain, is calling on this Parliament to adopt stricter requirements for petrol and diesel."
"Better fuels are the key to reducing emissions, and we must give them our wholehearted support."
"The oil companies are worried about their high investments."
"For one thing, the fuels Parliament wants to see already exist in various countries."
"No-one denies they will involve greater investment, but the oil companies' balance sheets are remarkably healthy; they are making enormous profits."
"I am sure they can take these investments in their stride."
"To avoid any misunderstandings, I have nothing against large international companies or anyone else making big profits, but it is our job to look after our population's health, and it is also one of the Community's declared objectives."
"As Members of Parliament, we are bound to implement the duties of the Community as laid down in the treaties."
"We will have a chance to put this into practice in tomorrow's vote."
"Mr President, this debate has been something of a battle between the vehicle and the oil industries to woo the European Parliament to one or other side."
"I regret that because the position is rather more complicated by the chemistry of this Parliament itself."
"It has to be recognized that the European Parliament has built up - and we see this in the persons of our rapporteurs - a certain expertise in this field."
"Parliament is reluctant to abdicate a role in the conciliation process which we would do if we simply said 'fine' to the common position."
"I would ask you to remember that this is the last open debate to be had on these subjects before they disappear into the Conciliation Committee."
"I and my British Conservative colleagues are likely to support the Hautala amendments but we have our doubts over some of those proposed by Mr Lange."
"We accept that there are some Lange amendments which require changes in vehicle production that would be very difficult if not impossible to bring about within the accelerated time scale proposed."
"On the other hand, we see the Hautala amendments as likely to bring about improvements quite rapidly which will affect all vehicles on the road and not simply the very new ones."
"However, I want to sound an alarm over the question of leaded petrol."
"We should not look kindly on legislation that, on the one hand, says that all leaded petrol will be banned from 1 January 2000 and then also says that where a country can plead socioeconomic difficulties this ban will not have to apply until the year 2005."
"This kind of thing makes it very difficult to argue that we all care equally about Europe's environment."
"In some of our more crowded ancient cities enormous damage is being done to people's health by emissions from leaded petrol engines."
"The let-out clause for such countries would allow this to continue for another seven years."
"We welcome the ban from January 2000 but we owe it to the millions of people who own cars that run on leaded petrol to tell them what happens then."
"In Britain there will be 1.3 million cars at least still on the road in 2000 that were designed to run on leaded petrol."
"Imagine the headlines: ' Brussels drives us off the road' ."
"It is now up to the oil industry and to the governments in the countries which have no contingency plan to find some way out to offer people who own these cars, either through the marketing of lead additives or through the marketing of re-formulated petrol."
"We owe it to these people and the Commission, national governments and the European Parliament should come up with some solution for them."
"Mr President, Commissioners, the citizens of Europe are rightly asking to be able to breathe clean air in their cities, and the Auto-Oil programme, which the European Parliament is preparing to vote on at second reading, proposes a global strategy for trying to achieve specific air quality objectives, in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organization."
"We are faced with two very important measures that will certainly have an impact on the environment as well as on the industrial strategies of our countries: the Hautala report proposes to establish new regulations on petrol by the years 2000-2005, particularly as regards the percentage of reduction in petrol, aromatic products and sulphur contained in fuels, that are causing serious illnesses such as cancer; and the Lange report proposes to make certain modifications to engines by those same dates, providing them, for example, with a special on-board diagnostics system (OBD) to control the limit values for emissions."
"According to the Lange report, the motor industry is therefore required, in a realistic and technically feasible space of time, to adapt to the specific limits laid down by the directive while, with the Hautala report, we can go further than the common position, maintaining the modifications introduced by the Committee on the Environment, aimed mainly at establishing stricter limits for petrol and diesel."
"Italy, in anticipation of the Community directive, has imposed severe limits for some time on petrol (1 %), aromatics (35 %) and oxygenized products (2.7 %) and, apart from several problems with sulphur and lead - for which stricter limits should be achieved by 2005 - has certainly the best petrol in Europe today."
"I hope that these directives, improved by Parliament during conciliation, are approved and come into effect as soon as possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of a long list of speakers, including many from my group, it is up to me to say something new."
"That is not an easy task, but I think I can manage."
"First of all, I would like to set out the position of the Group of the European People's Party."
"Some differences certainly emerged in this debate."
"It has been quite a struggle, but I can inform you that my group is in favour of the Lange report and the Hautala report."
"We have not been able to support all the details."
"However, we are first and foremost in favour of mandatory values for 2005 in both reports, and I think that is the key issue."
"I am glad that we have achieved this result and that we will therefore be giving this our 314 votes at tomorrow's sitting."
"I would like to make a comment now on competition."
"I believe it is right that we have discussed the competitiveness of German industry and industry in other Member States; it is also right that these industries have presented the problems to us and that we are looking at this in a global European context."
"But there is an important difference between this and our normal debates."
"We often burden our industry with conditions that other players on the world market do not have to comply with, which therefore restricts competition."
"This case is totally different, because if a company or a refinery outside the EU wants to sell petrol within the EU, it has to comply with our conditions."
"So it is not a question of a distortion of competition that will push up our production costs, but rather a sensible means of protecting the environment and enhancing our capacity for innovation."
"Finally, I would like to make a comment to the Commission."
"I am sorry that Mr Bangemann is not with us."
"I would like to say this to him personally, but you can pass it on to him, Mrs Bjerregaard."
"We have a new European Union health policy, thanks to this Parliament."
"Even Mr Bangemann changed his view."
"He brought forward some good proposals on baby food and the labelling of maize and soya."
"Please tell him that we would be delighted if he decided to share Parliament's viewpoint."
"Perhaps that will make him realize what is needed, and enable us to get a really good result in the Conciliation Committee."
"Mr President, I would simply like to say thank you for the debate."
"I think it has been exciting to listen to all the contributions on the problems this report raises."
"It has also been clear to the Commission that there has been considerable support for the reports by Mr Lange and Mrs Hautala."
"All we can do now is await the vote tomorrow and prepare ourselves to begin conciliation procedures."
"I can only say that I hope we can get this started quickly."
"I think the proposals deserve our unanimity so they can be applied in real life."
"As I see during the debate today, we are at any rate agreed on the goals, and so it should be possible to achieve a result within a reasonable period of time."
"So thank you for the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"European Environment Agency -European environment information and observation network"
"The next item is K. Collins' report (A4-0030/98), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EEC) amending Council Regulation EEC No 1210/90 on the establishment of the European Environment Agency and the European environment information and observation network (COM(97)0282 - C4-0363/97-97/0168(SYN))."
"Mr President, the Agency regulation which we are, I hope, going to conclude this evening, entered into force in October 1993."
"I do not need to go into the history of it."
"It was a fairly vexed history at the time."
"At the time it provided for a review of the regulation two years later."
"However, the review itself was then postponed for a further two years to allow it to be a fully operational Agency."
"If it had happened earlier it would not have been operational."
"The Commission proposal, when it came, was fairly uncontroversial and the aim of the amendments to the proposal is to strengthen existing provisions and thereby allow the Agency to consolidate its work to date."
"However, I think a lot of people still do not understand what the functions of the Agency are."
"That came through very clearly indeed when we were discussing it in committee."
"I would like, therefore, tonight, to lay out the aims of the Agency and then describe how my amendments will further them."
"The key reason for setting up the Environment Agency in the first place was to facilitate the collection of comparable environmental data across the Community, across the whole of Europe, indeed."
"Until the establishment of the Agency we had no way of comparing the state of each nation's environment, and yet comparable data are clearly a prerequisite for an effective environment policy."
"Quite simply put, the Member States all collected environmental data, but you could not compare Spain with Portugal; you could not compare Portugal with Greece, nor Greece with Germany, nor Germany with the United Kingdom."
"So we could not have an overall view of the state of the environment in the Community."
"That was the reason, in the first instance, for setting up the Agency."
"The long-term aim is for the Commission to use the data supplied to the Agency to help monitor the state of the European Union environment and also to implement environment policies more effectively."
"The Commission reviews the Agency performance to date."
"Basically its review is pretty favourable."
"It suggests some new areas for Agency action and, broadly speaking, is in favour of further increased cooperation between the Agency itself and third countries, particularly those in central and eastern Europe."
"We very much welcome that, with the prospect of enlargement looming."
"However, there are certain gaps in the review."
"I have attempted to fill these with my amendments to the report."
"For instance, the Commission proposal overlooks the very important role of Parliament."
"It says very little about it."
"It tends to over-emphasize the role played by the Commission and the Council."
"I can understand why that happens, but I think it is right that we should correct it."
"I also feel that the Agency and the Commission need to put in place a framework in order to facilitate greater cooperation between them and avoid duplication of each other's work."
"The Commission should not be doing work that is being done by the Agency, and the Agency should not be doing work that is being done by the Commission."
"We have tried to clarify that."
"As the Agency plays a key role as information gatherer in the Community in order to aid the Commission's implementation and enforcement of legislation, it should be encouraged to cooperate more with bodies such as IMPEL because enforcement and implementation are key features of the development of environment policy in the Community."
"It is clear that in order to provide information to the general public the Agency needs to publish documents in more languages, wherever possible."
"That is one of the reasons why I fully support, for example, Mrs DÃ­ez de Rivera Icaza's amendment."
"I believe that the provision of the repository of information and a data register will allow the Agency to disseminate information better to the general public."
"That is also a very important feature of environment policy in the Community."
"Finally, if we are going to require the Agency, and we do, to produce a multi-annual work programme, then that has to be complemented by a multi-annual budget."
"To do one without the other, I think, and the committee believes this, is entirely inconsistent."
"That final point is very important because the key challenge faced by the Agency in the view of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection over the coming years will be the budgetary challenge."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we would do well to note that simply because the Agency has not had its functions considerably expanded does not mean that it should have its budget frozen or reduced."
"We need to consolidate its work."
"This, after all, is an Agency that contributes significantly to European Union policy and could contribute even more significantly in the future."
"Therefore it needs a degree of autonomy."
"It requires the support of Parliament behind it."
"The Agency needs to consolidate its work to date and then be allowed to expand if and when necessary."
"But it can only do that if it receives the right budget."
"Frankly, some of the attitudes displayed in some of the amendments that we received from one important committee of Parliament did not suggest that anybody really understood that properly."
"This is a functional Agency."
"It is not a think-tank."
"It is necessary for the Community."
"It is a functional part of the Community and needs to be treated as such."
"Mr President, this report is part of a five-year review of the European Environment Agency which is based in Copenhagen."
"The aim of the Commission review is to decide if the agency's status and tasks need upgrading."
"Obviously the nature and substance of its work is more a matter for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection than for the Committee on Budgets."
"In the light of the financial constraints which apply right across the whole of the European Union, the budgetary implications for this agency are fundamental to its future."
"Before I go any further I should like to congratulate the Director and staff of the Environment Agency on the way in which they have managed successfully to implement the objectives set out in the founding regulation and to express my appreciation of the way in which the agency has supported Parliament's moves towards transparency and accountability and the harmonization of the regulations."
"The draft report by Mr Collins has taken over one of the three amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets, the one on Article 1(6)."
"The initiative recommended by this amendment will provide Parliament, as the political and budgetary authority, with the right to evaluate for the first time the cost-effectiveness of the environmental policy of the Union."
"The tasks which are decentralized and executed by a satellite body and the activities run at a centralized level by the Commission need to be clearly defined in order to ensure complementarity and to avoid duplication."
"On the other hand, Parliament has stated clear principles for all the agencies within the 1998 procedure."
"Since the budget and the establishment plan are published in the budget and therefore belong to budgetary remarks, any change to them needs to be communicated to the budgetary authority."
"The Committee on Budgets has been consistent with the Parliament's decision and has tabled its Amendment No 1 in this sense."
"This was an opportunity to enable the Environment Agency to draw down resources for alternative budget lines and could have helped the agency to receive extra payments for rented services as its basic regulation allows, provided transparency is assured."
"If the Environment Committee had maintained this amendment it would have given legislative coverage to that budgetary position."
"We are sad that this has not been taken up."
"The Committee on Budgets is also concerned about the annuality of the budget process in the Environment Committee's Amendment No 8."
"In the same way, between the link between the work programme and the approved budget, there is now a horizontal principle adopted by Parliament which applies to all agencies and which gives them some sense of flexibility to make a selection of their priorities."
"Therefore, the Committee on Budgets has introduced this principle in the legislative proposal."
"Mr President, there can be no doubt that we think the Environment Agency in Copenhagen has made a good start to its activities."
"We now hope that with these opinions we can make the Environment Agency even better."
"The starting point for the Committee on Research has partly been to not demand too many changes, since the Environment Agency has just started many of its new tasks."
"However, we have proposed some minor changes."
"The Agency's task is to provide us with information about environmental policy so that we can conduct a good environmental policy."
"We on the Committee on Research think there should be a unit within the Environment Agency to check the quality of data and assess the uncertainty in the material collected from the various countries."
"The main task of this unit would be to continuously monitor the quality of the data being offered and to be expressly responsible for identifying and describing the uncertainty which there is in much of the data collected."
"In addition, the unit should also have the authority to question the national data collected, and be given sufficient resources, if appropriate, to seek and obtain alternative information."
"It is only with relevant information that we can make the necessary and right decisions in the environmental sector."
"Within the Environment Agency a great deal of expertise about the environmental area has also been built up."
"It would therefore be a great mistake if this environmental expertise was not used."
"Consequently, the Committee on Research recommends that the Environment Agency should not only do work to order, for example where giving advice and expert opinions are concerned, but that it should also be able to initiate various projects itself."
"In addition, it is, of course, important for us to be able to disseminate the information which the Environment Agency collects so that everyone is able to use it, not least the general public and non-governmental organizations, the research community, students, etcetera, in order to make the material and thus the EU's environmental policy as good as possible in future."
"Mr President, for us, the Members involved in the struggle to create and establish the European Environment Agency, nothing is more satisfying than the Collins report on the assessment and revision of that Agency's responsibilities."
"As Mr Collins shows, in the short time it has been in existence the Agency has amply fulfilled the objectives established by the then President of the Commission, Jacques Delors. It has accurately and competently provided objective, comparable information on the environmental situation in Europe, so that Parliament, the Commission and the Member States can all respond appropriately."
"Having said that, I just want to spend a moment on one aspect of the new responsibilities: the area of strengthening its information function."
"In other words, whenever possible, the Agency should try to issue its publications in all the official languages of the European Union, as Mr Collins said."
"Otherwise, the valuable work the Agency does to spread information would be diminished, and it would cease to fulfil its main objective."
"I realize, Mr President, that that involves extra expense."
"But the cost of environmental damage is greater, and one of the objectives of the European Environment Agency is to prevent that very damage, as I said a moment ago."
"An amendment has been presented on this point and I hope the Commission and the Council will see fit to accept it."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, of course the European Environmental Agency wasted a lot of time at the beginning, because it was three years until its location was decided."
"We are still making up for that lost time."
"Nevertheless, despite all the problems that entailed, the Agency has done some very good functional work, which I would particularly like to acknowledge here."
"However, it is also true to say that the amendments to the regulation on the establishment of the European Environmental Agency essentially reflect the functional requirements that have since become apparent, and that only limited changes in its role are envisaged."
"The planned widening of the Agency's role relates to supporting the Commission in monitoring environmental impact and in producing reports, disseminating information on environmental research and setting up a repository of environmental information."
"We also particularly welcome the proposal that the Agency should support the Commission as regards the reports."
"The objective of involving the Agency in reports must, however, be to avoid duplication in cases when the Commission and the Agency separately request data and reports from Member States. We also need to ensure that the Commission and the Agency act on the basis of the same sets of data."
"In monitoring the work of the EEA we need to put special emphasis on the need, as a long-term objective, to harmonize national environmental information systems with the European environment information and observation network; to ensure close coordination between the Agency and the Member States on the subject and methods of data acquisition; and lastly, to make sure that we do not create data cemeteries by gathering and archiving unwanted and useless data."
"On a formal note, I must once again criticize the Commission for not presenting a consolidated proposal, which made the discussions Mr Collins led considerably more difficult."
"Mr President, I congratulate our rapporteur on the studied and calm analysis of the way which the Agency is performing."
"It is very good and I congratulate the Commission also on that. I am bound to say that, until we get some helicopters in the Agency and introduce the concept of people coming from Copenhagen to put matters right, with those helicopters descending upon areas of serious environmental damage, then nobody is going to take it that seriously."
"But if we saw a helicopter they would and I am not being entirely silly about this because, although I have had this debate with my colleagues in the Environment Committee, I am conscious that our aspirations for the Agency are completely different from that what has been set up."
"As Mrs Schleicher said, it is a tame cemetery for data, that is not really good enough."
"What we should be aspiring to - and it would necessarily mean a change in the status and the statute of the Agency - is an Agency which is capable of carrying out international inspection."
"That means paying serious attention to the issue of enforcement which sadly, at the moment, is overlooked."
"We do not have the mechanism by which environmental law and policy can be enforced throughout the Union partly because that is still done by the nation-states."
"Nobody is going to respect nation-state agencies; they would however respect, in my view, an Agency which was international in composition and was an inspectorate of inspectorates."
"That is a long way away and perhaps we should not be making that kind of assessment of the Agency work so far, but unless somebody says from time to time that those should be the aspirations of the Agency, then it was surely not worthwhile Copenhagen putting up the understandable fight that it did to have the institution based there."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the decision in 1990 to found a scientifically independent European Environment Agency for the collection, processing and analysis of environmental data at a European level was an important development in the attempt to work out a credible and coherent policy for the environment sector in the European Union."
"Four years after that Agency began operating, we are called upon, on the basis of experiences and appraisals, to approve amendments in its founding regulation that will improve its work."
"The main aim of the amendments must be to extend and assist the collection and processing of reliable facts and figures, and especially the provision of information both to the institutional bodies and to the Member States for the elaboration of measures and policies."
"We therefore favour improved information and the formation of links between the Agency's work and the Community's institutional bodies, especially a stronger link between the Agency and the European Parliament."
"This is because Parliament's contribution to the preparation of policy guidelines and its participation in the process of legislation play a definitive and continually increasing role in the final formulation of environmental policy in the European Union."
"The Commission should not overlook that fact."
"Besides, we must stress that the policy of broader information dissemination via networks and telematic applications to all the decision-making centres, and to the wider public, will also contribute positively towards the appraisal of solutions and help make people aware of the justification and use of environmentally friendly technologies."
"We know that the correct application of Community law is today the Achilles' heel of environment protection policy in the European Union."
"The Agency can play an important part in collecting data and monitoring compliance with Community law once the use of the IMPEL network has been reinforced and extended."
"We are in favour of the Agency incorporating support for the Commission in the process of information exchange and the development of criteria for the assessment of environmental impact into its duties, since important problems have emerged in all the Member States due to the incorrect application of that directive."
"The amendments proposed are, I believe, necessary if the Agency's valuable work is to continue at European level, especially with the challenges the European Union will be facing when the forthcoming enlargement takes place."
"Mr President, may I start by thanking the European Parliament for having put this amendment to the regulations on the Environmental Agency on the agenda."
"I think it is important that we get these proposals passed as soon as possible, so that the Agency can start working under its new operating conditions."
"I would also like to thank Ken Collins, the rapporteur, for the work which has gone into the report."
"The Agency has got off to a good start, and its work is progressing well, as has been emphasized in the debate here."
"This is gratifying, and I know that Parliament thinks the Agency is very important."
"In the public debate, we have also been very pleased by the reports which the Agency has published, so we must continue to push on."
"And let me start by pointing out an important opportunity for development."
"It is vital that the Agency comes to play a role in the development of central and eastern Europe."
"We must ensure that the countries which so desire can be involved in the Agency's work, as Mr Collins, the rapporteur, also emphasized."
"I think the rapporteur's amendments are very positive, and I am very pleased at the constructive comments on the Commission's proposals."
"Amendment No 1 concerns the Agency's support for developing and implementing environmental policy."
"The Commission accepts both the proposal to return to the original wording of the regulations and references to other EU institutions."
"Nor is there any problem with the reference to the schedule of work. So we are agreed that there will be close cooperation, and we will work towards that."
"Amendment No 2 states that the information records as proposed are to include a data register."
