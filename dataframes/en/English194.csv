"Thank you, Mr Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Joint motion for a resolution on vegetable protein supplies and the situation in the European starch industry"
"Parliament adopted the resolution"
"We voted against this resolution, since it seeks to backtrack on sections of the CAP reform package which has been agreed."
"Venice"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Commission:"
"B4-0156/99 by Mrs Estevan Bolea, Mr Malerba, Mr Ligabue, Mr Danesin and Mr Castagnetti, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party-B4-0158/99 by Mr Ripa di Meana, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left-B4-0160/99 by Mr Dell'Alba, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Allianceon the crisis situation in Venice."
"Mr President, last November, a group of Members from Parliament's Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy visited Venice."
"As usual, we were fascinated by the city's immense beauty, but we were also very concerned - and still are - about its enormous and ever-increasing problems."
"Venice is an artificial environment created by man in the middle of a lagoon, yet it suffers from flooding due to 'high water'. This problem is becoming more and more serious and is essentially what has led to an exodus from Venice."
"This is what concerned me most, because a city that is truly losing its population will end up as a beautiful but dead museum, a still life."
"In 1951, Venice had a population of 171 000; today, it has less than 60 000 inhabitants, and a large proportion of these - 25 % - are elderly people."
"Moreover, there are over 10 000 empty dwellings, which are not cared for and which are falling down."
"Therefore, something will have to be done to keep Venice as it should be."
"Venice is a part of man's heritage."
"It belongs first of all to the people of Venice, to those living in the Veneto region, and to all of Italy, which is such an artistic country."
"It would be hard to imagine the world's museums without the Italian artists who have filled them with such beautiful works of art."
"And that is exactly what Venice is."
"However, it is also true that very special measures are required."
"Technological measures, that is, the measures for which the necessary technology exists, are the ones that have essentially caught the attention of Parliament's Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy."
"We must put an end to the floods that occur in Venice as a result of the growing phenomenon of 'high water'."
"We cannot prevent 'high water' - it is a natural phenomenon - but we do have the ability to introduce mobile dikes and build an underground subway, and this has all been looked at."
"The vaporetto is the only form of transport in Venice and it creates serious problems for the environment."
"As a result, we are asking the European Union, the Commission and, in particular, the Italian Government to take several measures."
"Firstly, we ask that resources be set aside for an intensive renovation of Venice under Objective 2 of the Structural Funds so that people can continue to live there."
"If this does not happen, Venice will disappear."
"Without people, there is nothing to protect and nothing to do."
"Secondly, we ask that tax concessions be granted to those companies that are brave enough to continue operating and producing in Venice at higher costs than other businesses. We also want the Commission to put an end to the sanctions it has imposed because the Italian Government has granted such concessions."
"Venezia vuole vivere e deve vivere!"
"Madam President, at the end of January, the Italian authorities submitted to the Commission a series of observations containing a formal position on the initiation of a procedure, under the reference C 81/97, following a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 18 February 1998."
"This procedure concerned state aid granted in the form of relief on social security contributions."
"In December last year, the Italian authorities asked in a letter from the Italian Permanent Representative that the deadline stipulated for their reply should be extended to 15 January 1999. The Vuole Vivere group, made up of businesses in Venice and Chioggia, submitted its observations, which were communicated to the Italian Government."
"These are now being examined by the Commission's services and will be taken into account in its final decision."
"We intend to make a decision on this issue by the end of May."
"With regard to Venice being included in the scope of derogations under Article 92(3)(c), I would point out that it is up to a Member State to indicate those areas which the state wishes to include in its regional list."
"The Commission then investigates the proposals."
"The Italian authorities, however, only proposed a part of Venice as an area to come under Article 92(3)(c). By a decision taken by the Commission on 30 June 1997, it was agreed that this area qualified for aid."
"As for Venice's inclusion in Objective 2, it might be pointed out that a Commission proposal on the implementation of the new Structural Fund Objective 2 over the period 2000-2006 provides for shared responsibility between the Commission and the Member States in determining which areas qualify for aid."
"As the Council has approved the regulation containing the general rules on Structural Funds, it is incumbent on each Member State to inform the Commission of those areas it regards as being in difficult circumstances, as long as they meet the requirements laid down in the regulations concerned."
"The Commission confirms those areas that qualify for inclusion in Objective 2 on the basis of these proposals and in close cooperation with the Member State in question."
"The problem of high water - acqua alta - in Venice calls for solutions that take account of the special features of the lagoon ecosystem."
"It is the task of the Italian authorities to find a suitable solution to this problem."
"Thank you, Mr Liikanen."
"I have received five motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2)."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"Madam President, as Mrs Estevan Bolea has said, Venice is an artistic and cultural heritage site which belongs to the world: this is known to all of us and has been officially recognised by UNESCO."
"I am sure that all Members are familiar with Venice and that some never tire of visiting it."
"As we are all aware, the Venice lagoon represents a very particular hydrogeological environment: its equilibrium is fragile and was damaged in the 1960s and 1970s by industrial development along the coast."
"The phenomenon of 'high water' which, when it occurs, floods the historic centre to a depth of roughly half a metre, is now happening about ten times a year and causing growing inconvenience to the inhabitants and, even more so, to the economic activities of Venezia Laguna, the island part of the city."
"Venice is dying, it is said, not so much because it is sinking into the water - fortunately a very slow phenomenon - but because the population is declining, a very rapid phenomenon."
"Businesses which are not linked to tourism and produce high added value employment are relocating to the mainland to avoid the further inconvenience of Venice's severe transport problems."
"Yet Venezia Laguna did - and to a certain extent still does - have a tradition of non-pollutant, high-tech industry and services."
"Unfortunately, it is clear that the only way to keep these businesses where they are is by granting direct fiscal and economic incentives to firms operating in Venezia Laguna."
"This policy has been pursued by the Italian Government, with varying degrees of success, but it now appears that this approach is coming in for criticism from the Commission."
"I was pleased to hear that Mr Liikanen allows the Member State to have the last word, as it were, concerning this policy, but I fear the axe of DG IV - responsible for competition - which is normally reserved for state aid."
"The city authorities discussed this with us when our delegation visited them."
"I do not think we should become involved in the experts' debate on specific ways of solving the high water problem, but I do believe that Venice should be thought of as an area with particular problems, in need of aid and assistance to preserve a viable economic existence."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems odd in a way that this House should be debating something as obvious as protecting the city of Venice."
"As many others have said, the city is a world heritage site located at the heart of an extremely fragile man-made ecosystem."
"I should like to dwell for just a moment on this first point."
"The rulers of Venice in former times succeeded in creating a virtually unique model of development."
"They devoted incredible energy, hundreds of years ago, to protecting an unstable ecosystem."
"They began by developing trade, and then they transformed the city of Venice into a major international cultural centre which saw the inception of the modern publishing industry, for example, and always enjoyed far greater civil and political liberties than the neighbouring countries."
"The fact that Europe's political leaders should now be addressing themselves to this issue, and considering how to overcome obstacles in this area, is therefore quite disconcerting in some ways."
"Community rules are designed to assist development, not to curb it."
"Community rules must not be applied unthinkingly across the board, as though the European Union were synonymous with uniformity."
"It is glaringly obvious that state aid granted to Venice is unlike state aid granted to any other EU region: it serves to safeguard our heritage, which we did not create but inherited."
"Mistakes have been made, not least in terms of industrial development, partly by the Italian Government: the Porto Marghera petrochemical plant has almost certainly destabilised the delicate equilibrium of the lagoon."
"But as the Commission President-designate, Mr Prodi, said here, we want Europe to be at the leading edge of business development. If this is so, we must ensure that Venice is one of the centres driving this new entrepreneurship."
"Applause"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the magnificent heritage that Venice represents is struggling with depopulation and mass tourism and is regularly under threat from flooding."
"The entire lagoon is heavily polluted, and the industrial hinterland on the mainland is mainly made up of huge chemical works which place an enormous burden on the environment."
"The Greens feel that a coordinated approach is needed to tackle these problems, both at national and international levels."
"We need to promote economic development that spares the lagoon and the historic buildings."
"This is why we are in favour of converting the petrochemical plants in Marghera to be more environmentally friendly, and we also wholeheartedly support the Italian Government's decision to review the MOSE project for a sort of mobile protection for the city."
"I should like to draw attention here to an amendment by Mr Dell'Alba calling for the Italian Government to review this decision."
"That would be sending out a completely negative signal and would simply be maintaining an approach which does not come anywhere near the heart of the problem."
"I would therefore urge you most strongly not to support this amendment."
"We want Venice to become a place of innovative and sustainable urban development, and the Commission has come up with some good proposals for measures to promote sustainable urban development in the EU."
"The main elements here are tax incentives for housing restoration, with special conditions for highly sensitive locations such as Venice, of course; tax incentives for small and medium-sized firms providing employment without polluting the environment; sustainable tourism models, perhaps with rules on limiting access in certain peak periods; and measures to support the local economy based on the sustainable use of natural resources and the city's historic heritage."
"Madam President, many foreign colleagues from various countries are concerned about Venice and trying to help."
"This is the most telling proof of the fact that, as confirmed by UNESCO, Venice is a world heritage site."
"Venice clearly does belong to humanity as a whole, since when wandering through its streets and over its bridges, eight out of every ten people one comes across are tourists, and seven of those eight are foreigners."
"Well, these tourists make Venice their own, using its services and damaging its structures, often for just a single day, meaning that the Venetians themselves gain precious little."
"It is only right, therefore, that this tide of humanity should begin to concern itself with protecting these assets and with the associated costs."
"What can be done, apart from levying indirect taxes on a few day-to-day consumer goods?"
"At least three measures would be feasible at Community level - if I may put forward some concrete ideas - and it would be up to the Commission and the Member State, Italy, to devise the appropriate legal and economic instruments."
"First of all, an ad hoc project could be included in the LIFE budget line for the high water problem; the problem is not a new one but is causing increasing damage to Venice."
"Secondly, Venice should be placed squarely within the future Objective 2, which deals with urban decline."
"Thirdly, in agreement with the Italian Government, a derogation should be allowed under Article 92 of the Treaty, referring to state aid, so as to grant tax concessions and incentives to all businesses which start up - or plan to do so in the future - and to keep alive initiatives liable to guarantee employment, but above all to safeguard the life and soul of Venice."
"I have heard talk of schemes to transform Venice into a new model of residential settlement: there is no need."
"It is simply a matter of refurbishing the 10 000 abandoned dwellings which are crumbling into the lagoon."
"That should provide work for everyone!"
"Thank you, Mr Santini."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Joint motion for a resolution on the crisis in Venice"
"Madam President, I just wanted to say that my group had intended to vote in favour, but because of Mr Dell'Alba's amendment which we specifically objected to, we naturally felt obliged to vote against in the end."
"Parliament adopted the resolution"
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"The sitting was closed at 11.20 a.m."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 16 April 1999."
"Tribute"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry to have to tell you that our former colleague and Vice-President Hans Peters died last week."
"Along with many other Members present here today, I remember his sterling work on Parliament's Committee on Social Affairs. This was just one of the ways in which he expressed his strong commitment to social and trade union affairs which led him to become a Member of this House."
"Many of us will also recall the special interest he took in matters concerning premises as a member of the specialist group of Parliament's Bureau."
"He gave his all to the House for many years. In accordance with our tradition, therefore, I feel it is appropriate to ask you to observe a minute's silence in memory of our colleague."
"Parliament observed a minute's silence"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the sitting of Friday, 16 April 1999 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
") Mr President, as we begin this part-session, I wish to protest at the fact that I was not allowed to organise a seminar on the peace process in the Basque country to which all parties which signed the Lizzara declaration were invited."
"I and all those invited were banished to the visitors' centre."
"I think the President of Parliament, who did everything possible to keep this seminar from being held on our premises, has not acted as a president of Parliament here, but as a party-political ally of Mr Aznar, and I deplore that."
"Mrs Maes, a room was made available for you to meet with the people you decided to invite."
"It was a visitors' room, and this arrangement was made precisely because you anticipated a large number of visitors and had informed our services accordingly."
"All that happened was that the usual arrangements for meetings of this nature were made."
"Nobody prevented you from meeting together, and you did in fact hold a press conference with the visitors who attended. You were treated like any other Member in a similar situation."
"Mr President, today is the first day on which you will be applying our new Rules of Procedure."
"I hope that this will facilitate and indeed speed up the work of the House, notably during voting time."
"However, one of the new Rules is less important within the House than outside it."
"I refer to Rule 9(3), which concerns former Members of this House."
"Up to now we have had two categories of former Member: simple former Members and honorary Members."
"Some of those so-called honorary Members have used that title in a way that leads the public to believe that they are still Members of this House."
"That is why this rule was amended: to abolish this distinction between different categories of former Member."
"In other words, the system of honorary Members will no longer exist."
"As this is particularly important before an election campaign, in which some honorary Members are deliberately using the title in order to create the impression that they are still Members of this House, I would urge you to write as soon as possible to all those who still have this title to inform them of the new rule and the new situation."
"You know, as you are one of the authors of the new Rules, that Rule 9(3) states that questions concerning the rights and privileges of former Members are to be laid down by decision of the Bureau."
"That is the only option."
"Neither the Bureau nor the text of the Rules mention whether it is necessary to abolish the status of honorary Members."
"The Bureau decided some years ago that no more honorary Members would be created."
"Anyone who has been a Member of this House - honorary or not - has the same rights and privileges as have been laid down by the Bureau."
"In practice, it would be impossible to write to all honorary Members to inform them that they are no longer honorary Members."
"That is not in the Rules and the Bureau has not taken that decision."
"If you want the Bureau to consider the matter again, I will take note and put it on the Bureau's agenda so that it can take a decision."
"Mr President, on Friday of last week a bomb exploded in a crowded part of central London."
"Three people were killed and many more have horrendous injuries which, in many cases, will leave them scarred and disabled for the rest of their lives."
"This attack was the third such attack in recent weeks."
"Vicious nailbombs were deliberately planted in crowded areas frequented and populated by London's minority communities, people who can normally live quite contentedly and happily within the vibrant, mixed, multicultural city that is London."
"I am sure all colleagues will join me in condemning this sort of outrageous attack, whether it be perpetrated by racists, the far right, or whoever, and that we will all campaign for an end to such indiscriminate violence, especially in the weeks ahead leading up to the European elections."
"Furthermore, Mr President, I would be glad if you could send a message of sympathy to the injured and the bereaved on behalf of the European Parliament."
"Applause"
"I will do that and I will note that the House has unanimously supported your words."
"This terrible case demonstrates that racism and xenophobia must be fought continuously."
"It is not enough to designate one year to fight it."
"It recurs year after year."
"Mr President, we have just found out about the Council of Ministers' decision to allow staff of the Schengen group working in the Council to become European public officials."
"Such a decision, as you are aware, has repercussions for Parliament since, according to the principles behind the Interinstitutional Agreement, a European official who works for the Council can, at one time or another, become a parliamentary official."
"I also think that it is outrageous that officials can be recruited without first having sat a competition, as is common practice."
"You know how sensitive the public is as far as the rules are concerned, and with reason."
"I would therefore like to know, Mr President, how you intend to make the Council reverse its decision and ensure that these and other officials abide by the correct rules regarding recruitment."
"What I can do, Mrs Lienemann, is first of all to obtain some information and ask the Council what has actually happened and what are the reasons for this decision."
"Whatever the case, it will be up to the groups in this Parliament, the new Parliament, to take any steps that are necessary to ensure that the rules are respected."
"In the meantime, what I shall do is to ask the Council exactly what decisions have been taken, and for what reasons."
"Mr President, I should like to add something to what you said before we began to discuss the Minutes, namely that we must fight against racism and discrimination of all kinds every moment of every day, and not just now and again. Here in the House, we nearly always adopt a pro-human rights position precisely against discrimination on the grounds of race, sex, religion or sexual orientation."
"Against this background, I should like to request an extremely good explanation - and I really do mean a very good explanation - from the President and the College of Quaestors as to why on Wednesday a decision was taken not to go ahead with the exhibition which I had earlier arranged to be held here, and which had previously been given the green light."
"This concerns the Swedish exhibition, Ecce homo , which is about sexual orientation and the discrimination to which it can give rise."
"Mrs Eriksson, you will appreciate that exhibitions held in this House cannot run counter to the feelings of groups within the House."
"The artistic committee felt that in the circumstances the exhibition should not take place, and the Quaestors took the decision not to authorise it."
"That therefore is the relevant decision."
"Respecting the rights of minorities is one thing. Allowing minorities to impose their feelings or their attitudes on other people who may or may not be in a minority but who do not share their views is quite another."
"What is at issue is respect for freedom, which has nothing to do with respecting the rights of minorities."
"Mr President, as you and the other Members in this House may have heard, among the many accidents that have occurred in the terrible war in the Balkans, a missile destroyed a bus killing sixty people including fifteen children."
"I think the least we can do is send our condolences to their relatives and condemn these actions."
"Forgive my outburst of emotion, but missiles have also fallen on Bulgaria ... there have been many mistakes and we cannot simply say we are sorry."
"Let us at least behave as we behave towards all victims."
"Applause"
"Mrs Kokkola, Kosovo is in fact included on the agenda."
"The topical and urgent debate is the best context for any remarks a majority of the House believes to be necessary."
"I think that is the only way to proceed."
"Mr President, as we are about to adopt the Minutes, I should like to say that in my view we should reject Part II as it appears on page 6."
"You in fact declared inadmissible a motion of censure tabled by 66 Members from all the political groups and in so doing you have called into question one of their basic rights."
"It seems to me that the decision was based on an incorrect legal basis and on the pretext of a political argument - that is, the possible rejection of the motion of censure - whereas the notion of inadmissibility is only of course applied on the basis of legal considerations."
"The decision was taken and, as everyone knows, the Commission is continuing about its business as though nothing has happened since 14 January."
"What is more, it is a particularly risky decision to have taken as regards the future because it means that any Commission threatened with a motion of censure could resign in order to take the initiative and, as a consequence, prevent such a motion from having any effect."
"It is because of these three factors that I am opposed to this part of the Minutes since it is such an important issue for the future."
"I should like this particular part to be put to the vote."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, the process of approving the Minutes is designed to establish whether or not the Minutes are an accurate reflection of what took place."
"It is not a means of going back over the decisions which were taken, especially a decision which was not put to the vote, even if it was supported by a large majority in the House."
"However, this decision was not put to the vote because it was not necessary."
"It is quite clear that if it were possible to go back over decisions by changing the Minutes, we should no longer be respecting the Rules of Procedure."
"You will appreciate that I am not going to put this decision to the vote."
"Exclamation of 'Bravo, Mr President'"
"Mr President, taking up your reply to Mrs Eriksson, in which you explained the reason for not showing the exhibition Ecce homo here in Parliament, I now wonder how it came about that there was room for an exhibition by the Italian lobby group which preaches against abortion and against a woman's right to have an abortion?"
"Was that not a way of offending a very large group of people?"
"Let me make it clear that it was possible for the other exhibition to be held because it complied with the rules of the House."
"When the Quaestors say that an exhibition cannot be held because it deals with a contentious subject, there are two possible courses of action: the Bureau can be asked to change the rules on exhibitions, or it can be asked not to do so."
"As long as the rules in question remain in force, they must be observed."
"The Quaestors have interpreted them correctly."
"This does not justify reversing their decision."
"The Minutes were approved"
"Membership of political groups"
"I would inform the House that Mr Charles de Gaulle has been dismissed from the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations and that from 19 April 1999 he has been sitting with the non-attached Members."
"I would like to make a point of order, Mr President, regarding order in the House."
"Can the European Parliament not call for 'de Gaulle' to change names out of respect for the honour of Europe?"
"That is not a point of order, Mr Duhamel, and your comments are not in keeping with the dignity of the House."
"The political decisions of each Member are a matter for himself, his conscience and his electors."
"On a point of order, Mr President, concerning Rules 2, 5 and 119."
"At the eleventh hour, the Quaestors have taken an appealable decision in response to my letter of August last year."
"I am now lodging an appeal before the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg on the question of principle, namely who is it who determines the distribution of work of the elected Members of this Parliament: we ourselves or the Bureau, with all manner of financial penalties?"
"If I win, and I shall win, fellow Members of the House will get back the fines they have wrongfully been charged."
"As for the Kai Islands, I shall come back to those tomorrow."
"They will no doubt appreciate that, Mr Janssen van Raay."
"Mr Bru Púron has asked for the floor."
"Mr President, a group of former members of the militia who fought for the Republic during the Spanish Civil War are present in the gallery today."
"They have travelled to Strasbourg despite their age and I think they deserve a welcome."
"Loud applause"
"Agenda"
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"I would inform the House that following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, certain legislative reports on the agenda for this part-session are affected by changes in procedure."
"The details concerning these reports will be included in the Minutes of today's sitting."
"The President read out the changes to the agenda for Monday and Tuesday"
"Wednesday:"
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has asked for the report by Mrs Miranda de Lage on the cooperation agreement between the European Community and the United Mexican States to be withdrawn from the agenda."
"Mr van Dam has the floor to present this request."
"Mr President, The last item on the final draft agenda for Wednesday is Mrs Miranda de Lage's recommendation on the partnership agreement with Mexico."
"I propose that we remove this item from the agenda, since the agreement in question is still being negotiated."
"When it approved the interim agreement with Mexico exactly a year ago, Parliament expressly stipulated that the general agreement could not be approved until the results of the negotiations with Mexico were forthcoming."
"Well, these negotiations are still under way."
"Considerable progress is still needed in a number of areas, such as human rights and nature conservation."
"So if we approve the partnership agreement now, we shall be giving a blank cheque to the negotiators and abnegating the responsibilities of Parliament."
"It is in any case less than clear why we need to deal with the agreement during this parliamentary term. Parliament will be able to reach a far more balanced verdict on it in the next one."
"I therefore propose to the House that we do not deal with the agreement with Mexico this week."
"Mr President, I should like to make three brief points against postponement."
"First of all, there is a very strong case against agreeing to the EU/Mexico agreement on human rights grounds."
"However, there is an even stronger argument in favour of voting in favour."
"The House should hear and debate that argument and actually take a decision on it."
"Postponing the argument achieves nothing whatsoever."
"This has been under negotiation for five years."
"We gain nothing by delay."
"It is a responsibility which I would like to see this Parliament discharge."
"If it is postponed, the matter will be left over to a newly-elected Parliament which will be relatively unfamiliar with the subject."
"The second point is: I understand that many Members of this Parliament, including myself, are under pressure from non-governmental organisations to postpone this."
"Let me say as a friend, admirer and respecter of many NGOs - and I rely greatly on their advice - that were we to postpone, we would in fact be handing to NGOs the right of eventual affirmation or veto of this agreement."
"Nothing new will come out."
"That would be an abrogation of our responsibilities."
"We stood for elections and we won elections."
"It is for us to decide politically whether this should go ahead or not."
"My final point is in answer to Mr van Dam's contention that it is a blank cheque."
"It is not a blank cheque."
"If we agree to the Miranda report - and I am arguing in favour of agreeing as well as not postponing - that will set up the very framework in which human rights issues can be mentioned."
"It will set up the political dialogue which will allow us to judge human rights and that dialogue must - I repeat - be decided at the political level, and so should the vote."
"Therefore I am not in favour of postponing this vote any further."
"I put to the vote the request from the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations."
"Parliament rejected the request"
"Mr President, if I understand correctly, it has just been announced that the resolution on the Cologne summit is to be postponed."
"So I have a problem."
"We have a problem."
"We have received the resolutions from all the groups."
"We have also set a time for discussing them, tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"I do not know why this proposal has been made all of a sudden."
"I know the Socialist Group has tabled a very brief text with just a few paragraphs and perhaps the other texts may prompt a few changes to that, but I really do not see why something we should have got done last week is now being put off all of a sudden until Tuesday."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, the only thing which has been done is to extend the deadline for tabling amendments until tomorrow, Tuesday, at 12 noon."
"We have not changed the decision or the voting."
"All that has been done is to extend the deadline for tabling amendments, something on which there is normally a consensus in favour, although that may not always be the case."
"The President read out the changes to the agenda for Thursday"
"(The order of business was adopted thus amended)"
"Request for waiver of immunity (Mr Féret)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0210/99) by Mr Wijsenbeek, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on the request for the waiver of Mr Féret's parliamentary immunity."
"Mr President, this is the last report I am presenting at my last part-session after 15 years in the House."
"It is the ninth report of this parliamentary term, but I shall not bore you with statistics; sadly, it is not a very agreeable task, and I am concerned here not with legislation or promoting European unity, but with a question of parliamentary immunity."
"Nevertheless, there are one or two general remarks to be made on this."
"But let me start with the specific case in question."
"It concerns one of our colleagues who is accused of failing to meet his obligations under Belgium's far too complicated social security laws, specifically with regard to his assistant."
"All members of the House must, of course, comply with statutory obligations in respect of their assistants who are employed in Belgium."
"But the Member concerned rejects the charge and has even proved to us that he wrote letters to the Belgian social security administration confirming his intent to meet those obligations, but without ever receiving a reply."
"The events took place in 1995, and only in 1999 is the Kingdom of Belgium asking us to waive the Member's parliamentary immunity."
"Those are the facts."
"We should add the remarkable fact that in Belgium, someone who is the subject of litigation cannot take part in elections, and that gave us pause for thought, especially as we had ourselves had sight of the proof supplied by the Member concerned."
"We subsequently asked the Kingdom of Belgium for further information and simply got a confirmation of the request for a waiver of immunity that was received in the first instance; more significantly, it later became clear to us that this was merely a request aimed at ensuring that the statute of limitations could not apply."
"As a result, Mr President, in accordance with our case-law, in accordance with our fixed rule that parliamentary immunity protects not just the individual Member but the whole of this House and Parliament, we believe that the right course of action is to ask you not to waive parliamentary immunity in this case - and all the more so in that we believe, to quote my illustrious predecessors Georges Donnez and Jean Defraigne, that there may be a hint of fumus persecutionis here."
"I will end this contribution with a comment of a general nature."
"Very soon, a uniform statute for all Members of this House will be coming into force."
"But that uniform statute is missing one thing, and this concerns parliamentary immunity."
"There are still nationality-based differences as a result of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities, and that contravenes Article 6 of the Treaty."
"The fact is that all our Members enjoy immunity in their own countries on the terms enjoyed by members of their national parliaments, whereas we ought to be treated the same and to have a uniform statute."
"To give you an example: for French Members, the rule is that all political activities are covered by immunity, including those taking place outside Parliament."
"For the British and Dutch, there is no immunity at all in their own countries, except for what is said at plenary sessions of Parliament."
"It is high time our successors and the next committee responsible for the Rules of Procedure put forward a proposal to amend the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities so that all of us in this House are exactly the same."
"That is something I have striven to achieve over the years, and I do so again in this case."
"Thank you very much, Mr Wijsenbeek."
"Parliament as a whole can testify to the time and effort you have devoted to the House for so many years. We also admire your total dedication to your work."
"It falls to me, as President, to thank you on behalf of the House for the dedication, effort and good judgement you have shown throughout your work among us. I am not saying this as a formality, but with genuine appreciation."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I should like to echo your remarks in saying that we will miss Mr Wijsenbeek."
"Some of it will be a good miss, but most of it will be a bad miss in that Mr Wijsenbeek was one of the more interesting Members of this House."
"On behalf of the Socialist Group I should like to say that we will be supporting the Wijsenbeek report on the waiver of immunity of Mr Daniel Féret."
"In doing that we express our disappointment about the Belgian authorities who, after making serious allegations about one of our colleagues, and the conduct of his office and the payment of his assistant, failed, in my view at least, to supply adequate documentation."
"Mr Féret and I have sharply different political opinions."
"Frankly I hope he is defeated in the Belgian elections but I cannot allow him to be banned from standing on the basis of these allegations against him which have not, as yet, been substantiated."
"On that basis we will be supporting the report to maintain his immunity and in consequence to allow him to stand for election."
"Thank you, Mr Ford."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Request for waiver of immunity (Mr Moniz)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0262/99) by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on the request for the waiver of Mr Moniz's parliamentary immunity."
"Mr President, I shall carry on from where Mr Wijsenbeek left off. I would also like to reiterate what previous speakers have already said: Mr Wijsenbeek will be sorely missed in this House."
"The issues raised by the waiver of immunity we are concerned with today are actually only part of a more general problem: the fact that this House still does not have a single statute for its Members."
"This shortcoming is a historical legacy and does not make sense nowadays."
"The arrangements relating to privileges and immunities date from 1965 and therefore go back to a time when this Parliament was simply a parliamentary assembly. Its role as a representative of citizens of Europe was then only a dream."
"But that is no longer the case. At this stage, it simply does not make sense that there are so many differences between the various representatives."
"The fact is that, following the Maastricht Treaty and, in particular, the Treaty of Amsterdam, the people of Europe are beginning to forge a distinctive identity and to ask that their representatives be governed by common arrangements in every aspect of their work. This is particularly true of course where the waiver of parliamentary immunity is concerned."
"The second point to be borne in mind concerns immunity."
"Immunity is not a privilege."
"It is there to safeguard the House and is therefore a matter of public order."
"In the particular case of Mr Moniz which I am dealing with today, Mr Moniz specifically requested that his parliamentary immunity be waived. This was taken into consideration in the resolution by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure."
"The committee voted unanimously for immunity to be waived, not because Mr Moniz wished to appear before the judicial authorities, but because all the necessary conditions had been met."
"In this instance, the conditions take us back to the 1976 Act, to the provision made for privileges and immunities in primary legislation and from there to the Portuguese constitution and indeed to Portuguese procedural law."
"In this case, waiving parliamentary immunity does not present any difficulties as the allegations against Mr Moniz have nothing to do with his parliamentary activities. It should also be pointed out that proceedings now under way prove that there is no doubt whatsoever as to the validity of the allegations."
"However, the fact that the allegations are well-founded does not of course mean that Mr Moniz is guilty; that is for the courts to decide."
"Like the rest of us, Mr Moniz must realise that representing the people of Europe means being in the same position as any ordinary citizen as far as responsibilities are concerned. Only when the role of representative is itself at issue is there a need for certain provisions to guard against possible abuse of the legal proceedings which would be to the detriment of the institution, of Parliament and of the people."
"Consequently, the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities voted unanimously this afternoon to waive Mr Moniz's immunity. He will now be able to appear before the judicial authorities as was his wish."
"Turning to other matters, Mr President, it might seem to make little sense for the House to rule on waiving the immunity of a colleague when he has already told us that he did not intend to stand in the elections and when the House is in the last few weeks of its term."
"But I must speak as the spokesperson for the resolution by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and say that this is in line with the message the committee has been reiterating down through the years, namely that this Parliament is not dissolving. From the first to the last day of its term, Parliament must continue to rule on any issues that arise and to deal with any problems."
"That is why we have approved this resolution."
"Thank you, Mrs Palacio."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Annex V of the Rules of Procedure"
"The next item is the report (A4-0216/99) by Mr Fayot, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on the modification of Annex V of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, as this is the last report to be drawn up by the now defunct Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, I should like to say a few words."
"I should also naturally like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues, especially all those who have been members of this committee for a long time and in this respect, special mention must of course be made of Mr Wijsenbeek."
"I should also like to thank the committee's secretariat for the excellent work it has continuously carried out to ensure that the Rules of Procedure meet the needs of Parliament's work."
"From the next parliamentary term, the work of this Committee, of this defunct Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, will be divided between the two larger committees of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and the Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"In other words, the work it has carried out is clearly of some considerable importance as from now on it will be dealt with by two committees of greater standing."
"The present report, Mr President, centres on Annex V of the Rules of Procedure and, in particular, the discharge procedure."
"You will be aware that it was a letter from Mrs Theato, the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, that prompted the committee to consider Annex V. The letter inquired as to whether Article 5 of Annex V, which states that an absolute majority must refuse discharge, complied with the provisions of the Treaty."
"Last December we had lengthy discussions on the matter as well as on the issue of whether or not the proposal for a decision could be amended."
"At that time we adopted an interpretation, which was also adopted in the House, and also stated our intention to reconsider the whole of Annex V."
"This is what we have done within the framework of this report and I should like to point out that it is the result of close collaboration with the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I should particularly like to thank its chairman, Mrs Theato, who unfortunately cannot be with us today. I should also of course like to thank the draftsman of the opinion of the committee, Mrs Kjer Hansen, and all the members of the committee, who did some excellent work, because this directly involved the way in which their procedures are carried out."
"Many amendments were tabled to my draft report, although all of them were along the same lines."
"There was no fundamental disagreement as to which procedure to adopt."
"The key point was to do away with Article 5 and the absolute majority, to put the refusal to grant discharge on an equal footing with the granting of discharge, and to set out the procedure to be followed in cases where the decision was postponed."
"I should therefore like to highlight the fact that the new Article 3, the procedure for refusing or granting discharge, is the subject of three proposals."
"First, there is a proposal for a decision concerning the granting or refusal of discharge by, of course, a simple majority."
"There is a second proposal for a decision that provides for the closure of accounts."
"This is an important new element which would allow us to separate, on the one hand, the closure of accounts - a type of simple technical procedure, if you like, to check whether the accounts have been kept as they should - and on the other hand, the discussion or opinion of Parliament on the Commission's management of the budget."
"Lastly, there is a third proposal, a motion for a resolution, in which Parliament sets out its observations regarding the Commission's budgetary management."
"Only this motion for a resolution can be amended, according to the Rules of Procedure, if it is accepted by the House, as we are proposing."
"Finally, we have also set out a very specific procedure to be followed in the event of the decision being postponed, in order to highlight the need to develop the procedure further rather than simply leaving it as it is."
"A final article provides for its consideration by the House."
"The two amendments that have been tabled do not therefore significantly change the as set out by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, and, as a result, they do not alter the general philosophy behind it."
"Mr President, I hope that this new annex will facilitate the work of the Committee on Budgetary Control and Parliament."
"In my view, relations between Parliament and the Commission as regards budgetary management will be developed and enhanced as a consequence and I hope that the new Rules of Procedure will further enhance Parliament's work in monitoring the Commission's budgetary management."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Fayot on not just his report but also his chairmanship of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities over these last few years."
"It has been a truly excellent chairmanship."
"I should like to reassure him that the committee is not being taken over by the Committee on Institutional Affairs: it is merging with that committee to create a new constitutional committee, which will be a very important committee in this House."
"The issue we have before us arises because the Treaties themselves are not clear on what should happen if Parliament does not give discharge."
"We ourselves, as a parliament, interpreted the right to give discharge to mean that we also had a right to refuse discharge."
"That interpretation is shared by the other institutions and has been the practice for a number of years."
"However, the Treaty is silent on what should happen if Parliament refuses discharge."
"We as a parliament for many years interpreted the situation to be such that if Parliament were to refuse discharge, then the Commission concerned, if it was still in office, should take the necessary consequences and resign - it should have to go."
"In other words, refusal of discharge was tantamount in itself to a sort of motion of censure on the Commission."
"The Commission itself, through Commissioner Tugendhat, when he was budget Commissioner, appeared to accept that interpretation."
"That is why we have put in Annex V of our Rules that we needed not just a simple majority but also a special majority of Members of the House - an absolute majority - to refuse discharge, because otherwise the refusal of discharge could have been a backdoor way to censure the Commission by a smaller majority than that normally required under the Treaty."
"It was therefore to protect the Treaty that we put this special majority requirement in our Rules."
"All this, however, was undermined by the events of last December, when some Members of this House - some Groups indeed - wished to refuse discharge but keep the Commission."
"That was contradictory, and Parliament was obliged to address the issue through a separate motion of censure on the Commission, thereby destroying the direct link between refusal of discharge and the consequence of the departure of the Commission."
"A further problem appeared in that at that time there was probably neither a majority in the House to grant discharge nor an absolute majority to refuse discharge, and Parliament was therefore a prisoner between these two differing majority requirements in its Rules of Procedure."
"It is for that reason that it was necessary then to review the Rules."
"The Rules Committee has done that; we have based ourselves largely on the opinion given by the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Where we have not done that, my Group has tabled two amendments which will rectify that situation and, indeed, get rid of a contradiction which we believe exists in the report at present."
"This will therefore revert us to a simple majority both to grant and to refuse discharge."
"The consequence though is that refusal to grant discharge from now on is simply a reprimand on the Commission, not a way of censuring the Commission."
"If Parliament were to refuse discharge, it would then have to debate separately what the consequences should be if the Commission itself did not draw any consequences."
"Madam President, the Rules of Procedure are intended to enable decisions on issues of substance to be made and if possible to make this process easier, not to make it more difficult or even obstruct it."
"Unfortunately, this has not always been the case, and both the chairman of the Rules Committee, Mr Fayot, and Mr Corbett specifically referred just now to the particular circumstances in this instance."
"We remember that in the 1996 discharge procedure, inconsistencies and provisions which were contrary to the Treaty came to light; this was because Annex V laid down a larger majority for not granting discharge than the Treaty itself prescribes in Article 141 of the EC Treaty."
"That was the main problem!"
"Mr Corbett has in fact pointed out that there was support in Parliament for making something more of this relatively clear provision in the Treaty than it actually stated and still does state."
"That also contributed to the problems we experienced during the 1996 discharge which have already been mentioned."
"As a result of this situation, the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, acting on the instructions of the committee, made a request in this House on 15 January 1999 for the Rules Committee to clarify precisely what the Treaty itself provides for, that is to say for the direct link between refusal of discharge and a possible censure procedure to be removed."
"That has now happened."
"We ought - and here I fully agree with Mr Corbett - to thank very much the chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, Mr Fayot, for dealing with the matter brought to his committee by the Committee on Budgetary Control very swiftly and for being so willing to cooperate."
"We should also like to thank Mr Fayot for his work in the committee as a whole, and the fact that this committee will cease to exist in its current form - and this is the final point on which I agree with Mr Corbett - should not be seen as reflecting an unfavourable assessment of the work of the committee and especially not the work of its chairman; this is actually happening because in future we want important matters which relate to each other to be dealt with together."
"Seen in this light, a considerable amount of the work of the Committee on Budgetary Control will be in good hands in the future Constitutional Affairs Committee."
"Madam President, this report does not solve the problem of what consequences there should be for the Commission if Parliament does not give a discharge."
"That question is one to be dealt with under the Treaty, but we are getting some clear internal guidelines about what procedures we can use in Parliament."
"I am pleased that we shall no longer spend hours and hours discussing the procedural options, but are now getting some clear rules."
"I would therefore like to thank my colleagues, and especially Mr Fayot, for their very constructive cooperation in connection with the amendment of the Rules of Procedure, and I would especially like to express my gratitude for the understanding and sympathy shown to the views I have presented."
"It is important that we now have agreement between the Rules of Procedure, the Treaty and the Financial Regulation."
"I think it is crucial that it is clearly stated that we have three options."
"We can choose to give a discharge, we can choose not to give a discharge, or we can postpone reaching a decision on the matter."
"The rules will now also include a very important distinction between a technical postponement and a political postponement, where the reason must be clearly stated, as well as a clear distinction between the technical closing of the accounts and a political decision on whether or not we can adopt the accounts."
"One thing which is clear is that in December we chose to activate the rules concerning Parliament's role as the discharging authority."
"And as a follow-up to the extensive discussions which accompanied that, it is crucial that we now have some clear rules on how we should act in a similar situation to the one we saw before."
"I therefore think the Fayot report is a good proposal for what our rules should be."
"Madam President, when the most elementary rules of logic are disregarded in politics, it is rarely out of ignorance of these rules but because there is some interest in doing so."
"That is why the question I am asking myself today is this: why was it in Parliament's interests to block its own supervisory powers?"
"Might it not be the case that in the past - and I hope only in the past - it was more in the interests of the large groups in this House to protect the Commission than to call it to account and strengthen their own Parliament?"
"According to the Treaties, Parliament takes the decision on discharge by a simple majority."
"However, Parliament divided this decision into two procedures. Accordingly, the vote to grant discharge was by a simple majority, but the vote to refuse discharge was by an absolute majority."
"Hence the comical and completely absurd situation of a majority of this Parliament not voting in favour of granting discharge to the Commission, and the same Commission still not being refused discharge."
"This is an absolutely ridiculous state of affairs, which I can only put down to huge self-interest, and I hope that the large coalitions which put protecting the Commission before Parliament's right of control have learnt from the events of the past months and will be more loyal to Parliament than their Commissioners in the future."
"Madam President, as the chairman, Mr Fayot, mentioned earlier, this report was the result of excellent collaboration between the Commission on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities and the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The final text contains some positive points, but several other points leave us feeling somewhat dissatisfied."
"With regard to the more positive points, I should like to highlight the fact that we did not make a limited ad hoc amendment within the framework of the 1996 financial year; instead we set out a reform that will be valid for years to come."
"I should also like to point out that we have kept to our decision to refuse discharge, contrary to what had been expected. Any other decision would have been paradoxical to say the least in view of everything that has happened since December."
"We have the option of refusing discharge outright."
"Such refusal does not necessarily lead to a motion of censure, although it should logically lead Parliament to look at the need for one. What is more, we have done away with the anomaly in the Rules of Procedure whereby a refusal must be voted for by an absolute majority of the Members of Parliament."
"We do not entirely agree with some of the points adopted, for example, the fact that the President can inform the Commission of the reasons behind a refusal of discharge simply by letter, as this seems a rather secretive way of going about things."
"However, it would of course be necessary to eventually set out the reasons why Parliament might refuse to grant discharge."
"Our second point of contention relates to the role played by the Committee on Budgetary Control, which is in the process of losing the option it has had until now of giving its opinion on the amendments before they are put to the vote in the House."
"In my view, this responsibility was a positive element and I regret that it has been amended."
"Similarly, instead of saying that the amendments are inadmissible, the report should be referred back to the committee responsible if they are adopted."
"These are the points in the report on which we disagree."
"Madam President, the Commission has no intention whatsoever of interfering in Parliament's internal rules."
"However, on the basis of the opinion of its Legal Service, the Commission should just like to make a comment of a legal and institutional nature."
"The discharge procedure is governed by Article 206 of the Treaty and the decision to grant discharge was designed as a means of support to the initial financial nature based on the report by the Court of Auditors, despite the fact that over the years this has taken on a political dimension."
"The decision to grant discharge is a single act that cannot be divided up into a political decision on the discharge and a decision to close the accounts, which is to be taken at the same time."
"Such a division would change the institutional balance and require the Treaties to be revised."
"However, if discharge is refused, the accounts for that financial year need to be closed."
"This would therefore entail Parliament taking a decision to close the accounts, by default, and would mean that the actual procedures followed for the budget for 1982, 1992 and 1996 would be laid down formally."
"The Commission, for its part, will consider the legal feasibility of including such an option within the framework of the reform of the financial regulation."
"Madam President, please excuse me."
"The screens in the offices were in fact showing 'Wijsenbeek report' with me speaking on that report, a mistake I tried to put right."
"I realise my error and I shall insert a statement in the Minutes."
"I just wanted to say that I missed the debate on the Fayot report because it was wrongly indicated that another debate was taking place."
"I shall submit an explanation of vote."
"Thank you."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"General economic policy guidelines - European Employment Pact"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0222/99 by Mr Fourçans, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the Commission recommendation for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community (drawn up pursuant to Article 103(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community) (COM(99)0143 - C4-0208/99); -A4-0239/99 by Mr Menrad, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the European Parliament's contribution on the European Employment Pact and on the Commission's communication on Community policies in support of employment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report I am presenting this afternoon follows on from the Annual Economic Report we adopted on 11 March."
"Today's report on the BEPG (broad economic policy guidelines) places greater emphasis on the economic strategy and the structural reforms needed according to the specific situation in each Member State."
"Commissioner, our text comprises two main sections, in line with the Commission's proposals: the macro-economic section and the structural section."
"First, I would like to look at the macro-economic section."
"Although a slow-down in growth has been predicted for 1999, we are not talking about a recession, which means that there is no reason to change the overall economic strategy in Europe."
"In other words, we need to develop our strategy along the lines of a good policy mix where salary increases correspond to productivity gains with a view to promoting growth and employment."
"More specifically, budget deficits must continue to decrease and the necessary adjustments must be introduced according to the speed with which this reduction occurs. This means that automatic stabilisers should have a part to play, but I would stress that they must not jeopardise any reduction achieved in public deficits which is absolutely vital for growth and employment today and, above all, in the future."
"If this is to be achieved, such a reduction should be mirrored, where possible, by a reduction in taxes and other levies, or at least by their stabilisation."
"This approach requires greater control over state expenditure and improved effectiveness and quality in terms of public expenditure."
"As regards monetary policy, we should of course like to emphasise the importance of the ECB's independence, which is essential for it to best fulfil its role in the area of price stability and guarantee the conditions that encourage growth and employment."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, it should indeed be independent, but not at the expense of the vital democratic accountability that we in the European Parliament must vigilantly ensure."
"The second section of our proposal relates to structural reform."
"If unemployment is to be significantly and permanently reduced, growth is undoubtedly important, but it will only be achieved by way of thorough, consistent reforms that are adapted to suit the specific characteristics of each of our Member States, as advocated by the Commission."
"What is more, such reforms need to be carried out over a period of time in a consistent and determined manner."
"What do these reforms involve?"
"I shall not go into details here but I would simply like to tell you about the general ideas."
"Improving the workings of the single market and the European markets in general is one of the key aspects."
"In order to achieve this, Commissioners, there needs to be greater integration in terms of the financial markets."
"Moreover, the markets in goods and services also need to be opened up as they provide the greatest number of jobs."
"The level of participation in the labour markets must also be increased and we must render them more flexible by adapting the social welfare systems and reducing labour costs, particularly for workers with less skills."
"Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, we must continue to liberalise the telecommunications, energy and transport sectors and guarantee better financing for SMEs. We also need to reform the social welfare and tax systems as well as the education and professional training systems."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, this is the direction in which European economic policy should be moving."
"No doubt you will say that it is an ambitious programme, and I agree."
"But the public must be told the truth, especially in this pre-election period. They should be made aware that this type of reform is needed if unemployment is to be genuinely tackled and that the sooner it is implemented, the sooner we can begin to reap the fruits of our labour."
"Madam President, this report from the Employment Committee was originally supposed to deal mainly with a Commission communication on Article 127 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, that is to say with the mainstreaming of employment policies at Community level."
"The committee decided also to include the European Employment Pact planned for the Cologne summit."
"This became the main subject of the committee's report when publication of the communication was delayed by the Commission's resignation."
"The communication did subsequently appear, however, on the very day after the vote on my draft report had been taken in the Social Affairs Committee."
"It is now sensible to include it in Parliament's report together with several amendments, such as Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5 and 6."
"We were also under pressure of time with our opinion on the Fourçans report on the Commission's recommendation on the broad economic policy guidelines, which it is also my task to deliver."
"We should like to thank Mr Fourçans for his very fine work and also for the fact that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has taken on board some important points made in the opinion of the Social Affairs Committee."
"His report explains how the recommendation is exceptional in two respects."
"Firstly, these are the first broad economic policy guidelines since the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999."
"And secondly, for the first time, job creation is seen as the most important aim of economic policy."
"We recommend the adoption of the Fourçans report."
"Now let us return to the Employment Pact."
"The comment made by the chairman of the special summit on employment held in Luxembourg in 1997, Jean-Claude Juncker, also applies to the Cologne summit: it must not be a literary convention."
"He was referring to the many declarations made at previous summits which were not binding."
"In fact, a whole series of worthwhile, practical initiatives were decided on in Luxembourg and that is why we do not, thankfully, need to start from scratch."
"We believe that the European Council in Cologne has to make a tangible improvement on Luxembourg."
"To sustain a high level of employment, a longer-term strategy for tapping society's potential in terms of creativity, innovation, pioneering spirit and willingness to invest and perform needs to be developed, in accordance with the employment guidelines."
"Institutional reforms to promote dynamic competition and flexibility have to be coordinated with the need to maintain - but also to modernise - social security systems."
"Specifically, the Employment Committee's report calls for the following: an increase in the number of unemployed people to benefit from an active support measure such as vocational training or job-creation measures, compared with the proposals in the guidelines; the autonomy of the European Central Bank and the two sides of industry; and further efforts to consolidate public finances."
"We specifically declare our support for the stability pact; respecting it makes it possible for interest rates to be lowered and thus to stimulate investment."
"From this point of view, we recommend a wage policy geared to productivity."
"If profits and investment in new jobs are increased as a result of wage restraint, then it is not enough to fob the employees off with a simple thank you for that restraint."
"The Social Affairs Committee believes that there should be voluntary schemes allowing them to participate in both profits and capital."
"In return for a moderate wage agreement, employers might also increase their investment in human capital or recruit more workers and trainees."
"In addition, we call for intelligent working models and the reduction of overtime, for flexibility instead of a unilateral reduction in working time with full pay, an easing of the tax burden on labour, the convergence of corporate taxes to prevent the relocation of undertakings solely on tax grounds, and finally regular meetings of the political decision-makers with the two sides of industry and the European Central Bank so that common strategies can be agreed."
"In the committee, we also discussed the issue of whether special employment programmes for specific groups - such as young people or the long-term unemployed - ought to be implemented and financed at European level, on top of the national action plans and measures carried out by the Member States under the Structural Funds."
"This would be wrong."
"Subsidised employment programmes costing billions would be completely wrong - they are neither the right response to structural unemployment nor should they be financed at European level."
"On the other hand, greater cooperation when formulating national policies - through rigorous application of the employment policy guidelines and action plans and improved monitoring - means European added value, which, together with the stabilising effect of a hard common currency in the European internal market, will in the medium term also contribute to there being more jobs and less jobless, which is an important precondition for the social dimension of the European Union."
"With this in mind, I ask you to vote in favour of this report."
"I will close by telling you that colleagues from all the groups supported me in the committee by making constructive criticism and tabling constructive amendments."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Fourçans report is important not only because it fully endorses the Commission's recommendations, but also because it plays a clear part in the political debate that has caused a great stir among European circles, including within this Parliament. The debate focuses on whether or not the introduction of the euro has given rise to the need to relax the budgetary and monetary discipline that led to the historic decision of May 1998, with a view to promoting a more tentative form of economic activity."
"The position adopted by the Commission and by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy in this connection is qualified: while price stability is guaranteed and maintained, we can be more flexible as regards monetary policy, provided of course that budgetary discipline is maintained and continued."
"In fact, productive private investment has deliberately had to slow down for years precisely because of the enormous debt accumulated and the substantial sums given to finance both this debt and our deficits."
"One of the advantages of this report is that it has prevented us from giving in to the temptation that entraps many a politician on the eve of an election, namely giving into the people's demands."
"However, the people are calling for fewer sacrifices and more handouts, which is naturally incompatible with the demands of budgetary discipline."
"Placing the emphasis on macro-economic resources is much more attractive."
"Changing interest rates and extending public deficits are far more popular initiatives than the unwelcome measures of restoring the balance of social security, increasing the flexibility of the labour market and reducing labour costs for the least skilled."
"We should therefore welcome the fact that on the eve of the elections, Parliament, like the Commission, has been able to tackle the demands of the economy and managed quite honourably to resist the pressures of public opinion, the media and other pressure groups."
"This is why, Madam President, we welcome this report and will vote for it enthusiastically."
"Madam President, my compliments to Mr Fourçans on his lucid report, which looks like receiving broad support in the House."
"In recent months, we have on occasions had a robust discussion on which way to go: should we have an expansive policy as advocated by the Social Democrat group, along the lines of what Mr Lafontaine would like, or should we stick to the rules that we agreed?"
"I think it is a good thing - and it is presented in a balanced way in the report - that we have opted for that line, namely to stick to the rules."
"A measure of support is now developing among the Social Democrats too for implementing these kinds of structural measures, which are so important for ensuring the internal stability of the euro: low inflation, which brings lower costs and which also enables more jobs to be created through the structural measures."
"That is important not only for getting people into work, but also for those who are drawing their pensions."
"We shall have to guarantee this stability in future, and on the other hand we must ensure that there is greater flexibility."
"If we can stabilise our financial position - which is up to the Member States, and in that regard I am extremely happy with the Commission's response here, which Mr Fourçans emphasises in his report - in such a way that more jobs can also be created in the future, then we shall amongst other things strengthen our competitive position vis-à-vis the United States."
"In short, then: let us have more people in work in the Union and better provision for those taking part in the work process in these Member States."
"Madam President, the recent events that led to the Commission's resignation scarcely instilled it with the modesty they should have done, to say the least."
"In fact, the Commission's arrogance has once again manifested itself in its recommendations on the broad economic policy guidelines."
"How can we simply stand by and watch the Commission once again lecture the governments of the Member States in as diverse areas as public finance, social welfare and the labour market?"
"Each country has received a good dressing-down."
"Some are accused of budgetary relaxation, some are being clearly encouraged to reform their pension, health and welfare systems, while others have been told off for the lack of flexibility and adaptability of their labour markets or for being too slow in liberalising their public markets."
"Such an authoritative approach is all the more intolerable since these problems are a result of the guidelines that have been in place for years and that have led to the high unemployment rates and poverty experienced by the majority of our countries."
"These guidelines are based on the reduction of labour costs and they hamper growth."
"I welcome the fact that certain governments have expressed their support for relaxing budgetary constraints, and the Central Bank itself has had to take account of the risks of a slow-down in growth by cutting interest rates."
"However, budgetary relaxation alone will not be enough: the straitjacket of the stability pact must be replaced by a genuine growth and employment pact."
"This is why, in our view, the Cologne European Council must put an end to the grand and noble declarations on employment and commit itself to actually implementing effective measures."
"Our group has proposed several initiatives in this respect: boosting public investment through the release of additional resources, including at Community level; continuing to cut interest rates, using a more selective approach, with a view to encouraging projects that create jobs; reducing working hours without reducing salaries or flexibility; and establishing minimum wages."
"These employment policies should be integrated into all Community policies and be accompanied by quantified objectives that are binding and that can be monitored."
"Unemployment will only decrease significantly if such measures are adopted."
"Madam President, if the euro is a complete success it will improve competitiveness in the European Union, but, on the other hand, I would point out that structural unemployment threatens this competitiveness."
"This is very much a question of the simplest jobs having disappeared in our society, with differences in pay growing so enormous that some people are paid huge amounts of money for what they do, while others would in fact be more productive, in the traditional sense of the word, if they were not in the labour market at all."
"But that is in no way an acceptable state of affairs, either for society or from the human dignity point of view."
"Member States should make low incomes free of tax and lower the rate of taxation across the board since at present, for example, it is deterring people from even accepting temporary employment."
"Part-time workers and those engaged in atypical work should qualify for welfare and a pension if we wish to take responsibility for people who have to resort to atypical employment more and more."
"Madam President, I have a few comments on Mr Fourçans' excellent report."
"Budgetary discipline remains a good idea in all the Member States."
"Without good budgetary planning, it is very tempting to resort to a broad monetary policy to ease the pain."
"Popular support in the Member States for a tight financial and economic policy is an unpredictable factor."
"It is worrying that in some Member States, EMU discipline rests on one-off measures and not on structural change."
"The analysis commissioned from the Netherlands Economic Institute makes it clear that the main problem-cases in terms of EMU, and the ones which need more careful attention, are Portugal, Italy and France."
"Can the Commission and the Council guarantee that they will receive it?"
"In future, most countries will face a funding problem due to the fact of an ageing population."
"By no means all the Member States have yet begun to address this problem."
"Systems for financing retirement benefits, pensions and health care will need to be radically revised."
"Italy, Belgium, Portugal and Spain are Member States which remain sensitive to fluctuations in the rate of interest on their national debt."
"These countries need to modify the scheduling of their national debt and make sound progress on reducing their budget deficit."
"Madam President, Commissioner, it is good that the European Parliament's report on the broad economic policy guidelines in the Community and the Member States strongly emphasises how essential it is to coordinate economic policies, and that it goes even further than the Commission proposal by also demanding practical initiatives."
"The fact is that structural measures and labour market policy are only part of the answer to the unemployment problem, which we are all concerned about."
"What is decisive is whether we can achieve growth rates in excess of 3 % in Europe and in the Member States."
"For this to be the case, economic policy must fulfil its responsibilities in terms of employment policy and ensure that there is a balanced and appropriate policy mix in the European Union with instruments geared towards supply and demand."
"We need economic policies to be coordinated so that we can engineer and guarantee higher, sustainable growth."
"You see, monetary policy is no longer responsible only for price stability, financial policy only for a sound public budget, and wage policy only for pay trends."
"If the Central Bank, the State and the two sides of industry can work as a team - while fully respecting the independence of the individual parties - they will be able to exert a decisive influence on investment, growth and employment."
"All three players must therefore in any case be placed under an obligation to contribute to a balanced and appropriate policy mix in the Community."
"An essential part of this is a financial policy which will help in particular to increase investment and which will not try to consolidate without considering the economy."
"We need an incomes policy which will help to increase households' purchasing power without triggering increases in labour costs which exceed increases in productivity - which means that pay trends must be compatible with productivity gains, but should not fall below them either - and we need a monetary policy which will contribute to economic growth by delivering price stability."
"That is why the ECB's decision to cut interest rates was the right decision and an important step forward."
"The ECB has finally made its contribution to growth and employment in accordance with the Treaty."
"In this way, the Member States will also have more scope for investment in their budgets, even though consolidation is still an important goal."
"It should be borne in mind, however, that fiscal measures are one way of responding to cyclical or local blips in demand and that their effects vary from country to country."
"Establishing a strict deficit ceiling can definitely have an adverse effect, and greater account needs to be taken of individual situations."
"Apart from this, where are the proposals for how the Member States can stimulate public sector investment while still respecting the 3 % ceiling?"
"The guidelines need to give pointers here."
"Europe still underestimates the significance of cross-border infrastructure projects, and here - five years after the Delors White Paper was discussed at the European summit - the Council of European Finance Ministers is requested finally to produce European added value in the fields of transport infrastructure and information and communication structures, to push through modernisation schemes and here also to make offensive use of the European Investment Bank, so that in view of the sluggish economy, an upturn will be stimulated more than it has been hitherto by European public sector investment, if possible in partnership with private investors."
"Economic and employment policy complement and support each other."
"The Employment Pact must play a special role."
"It can only do so if the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment policy guidelines are drawn up at the same time, so that both sets of guidelines apply when both national budgets and the European budget are established."
"If fighting mass unemployment is the number one challenge for the future of Europe, then it is not only necessary for those involved to agree; the context in which action should be taken, as well as what it should consist of and the timetable, must be laid down."
"I think that this is how economic and employment policy can actually be linked together and if, in addition to this, tax policy also makes a contribution, for example through a reduced VAT rate being applied on labour-intensive services, then Europe will be able to make considerable progress."
"Madam President, this report contains a number of interesting admissions, for example, recital F states that there is a constant growth differential with the United States and in recital J, I read that fiscal pressure is generally high in the Member States, which is scarcely favourable to consumption, growth or employment."
"In paragraph 4, the rapporteur rightly acknowledges the modest performance of the European Union in terms of growth and employment and in paragraph 16 he notes that public investment is not always given the priority it should enjoy compared to operation expenditure. In paragraph 23, the rapporteur states that vigilance is required in view of the prospects of possible deflation."
"This is all well and good, but these observations do not lead the rapporteur to question any of the dogmas on which European economic integration is based."
"Let us take the example of the euro."
"The introduction of the euro prevents Member States from implementing monetary policies to regulate their situation."
"In the event of an asymmetric shock, which the report does not mention, those states that would be most affected, for example, by inflation, would no longer be able to fight it through a differential monetary policy."
"However, fiscal policy could naturally still be used, while wage policy or the unemployment rate could always be used as adjustment variables."
"However, calls for tax coordination, which is unfortunately advocated by the rapporteur in paragraph 34, mean that this second means of adjustment would no longer be open to the Member States."
"So unemployment is left as a regulatory instrument or pressure on wages, and why not indeed?"
"The problem however is that, quite frankly, no one is prepared to acknowledge this for obvious electoral reasons, as this would make the euro and its creators unpopular."
"The rapporteur, speaking on behalf of a committee dominated by the PSE Group and the PPE Group, could not of course express any point of view other than that of those two groups, and so could not denounce the fact that the Socialist policies implemented in 13 of the 15 Member States would put Europe at a competitive disadvantage in the global market."
"The combination of the global free trade movement and the increase in social and fiscal burdens, which are a result of these Socialist policies, partly explains Europe's low growth rate, particularly in comparison to the United States."
"There can be no social progress without economic growth, but there can be no growth where the spirit of enterprise is scorned by egalitarianism and bureaucratisation."
"Socialism is thus backfiring on the people because of its poor economic management and its dogmatic cosmopolitanism."
"The broad guidelines of a European policy should move away from state control and cosmopolitanism as these are the two things that essentially benefit the dominant American economy."
"Moreover, I regret the fact that the rapporteur did not consider it appropriate to mention the effects of the United States domination of the European economy."
"Lastly, it is unfortunate that the self-censorship that has prevailed in this report - which was unavoidable as there was undoubtedly no alternative - forced the rapporteur to limit his work to purely technical aspects, although it was often very thorough, without tackling the fundamental political issues facing our economies, which will one day have to be tackled before our people."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I have to say that we are especially glad, at this late stage, to be able to give our views and have a discussion on the European Employment Pact."
"Whilst Amsterdam and Luxembourg placed jobs fair and square on the European agenda, it is obvious that the Luxembourg process alone will not be enough to bring about a drastic reduction in unemployment in Europe."
"What we really lack is a strategy, a macro-economic European strategy and a structural employment policy which hang together, enabling us to focus our full attention on the right goals."
"We therefore welcome the German Presidency's proposal to make headway on a European Employment Pact."
"Indeed, the European Parliament itself has always insisted that a pact on employment is required, since the stability pact urgently needs something to counterbalance it."
"But in all honesty, the provisional version of this Employment Pact looks a touch anaemic."
"It will not be an umpteenth rehash of fine words as a policy mix or a revamp of social security, served up with a dash of Luxembourg sauce, that gives the European Union a decent policy on jobs."
"And quite frankly, the economic guidelines now before us simply continue to swear by an increasingly tight policy of cutbacks for many Member States, and the belief that flexible wage structures, a deregulated labour market and reductions in social protection will create jobs is definitely not my idea of what a European Employment Pact ought to be."
"It is more of an American-style cocktail which does nothing new to stimulate growth and merely makes for more social inequality and more uncertainty."
"Europe's Socialists and Social Democrats, inspired by Antoni Gutiérres, made proposals of their own for a pact on jobs at a congress in Milan, and I am delighted to see that both Martine Aubry and Dominique Strauss-Kahn have adopted large parts of these."
"The message is very clear, Commissioner."
"Certainly the European Pact must not be an empty vessel, but nor must it be a neo-liberal recipe book."
"It must contain concrete measures and must get all those involved to make clear commitments - the European Central Bank, the social partners, the ECOFIN Council and the Social Affairs Council."
"The key elements which we believe must feature in a pact of this kind include first and foremost a European strategy for growth."
"The current growth forecast of 2 % looks set to create even more unemployment."
"The special action programme agreed in Amsterdam was a good decision, but far too modest."
"So the European Investment Bank and the Fund must free up new resources and the Member States must also be enabled, through their own budgetary policies, to give their economies a shot in the arm, not by making the stability pact more rigorous but by interpreting it more flexibly."
"Secondly, we need a fiscal policy which is an incentive, rather than a disincentive, to employment."
"The decision on VAT on labour-intensive services is all very well, but in the meantime we still have the Monti proposals, the Primarolo proposals as our staple fare, if I can put it like that."
"This log-jam urgently needs to be cleared; we have to revive our European fiscal agenda."
"Thirdly, the guidelines on employment must be strengthened and given specific shape."
"One specific commitment might be this: if all the Member States did as well on jobs as the top three scorers, we could get not 150 million but 180 million people into work."
"And in any event, we urgently need to restore the link between work and social protection."
"Lastly, we need more coordination, more coordination between the guidelines on employment and the economic guidelines, not so much as regards timing but as regards substance."
"We cannot go on having economic guidelines which preach budgetary discipline and at the same time guidelines on employment which are subordinate to them."
"We shall never get a serious strategy for growth that way."
"It is this that the Cologne summit needs to understand, and I hope that somebody will listen."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard Mrs Van Lancker say that she does not want a neo-liberal recipe book; in response, I can only say that nor do we want the employment policy guidelines to become a Socialist book of fairytales."
"I should like to thank Mr Fourçans and Commissioner de Silguy very much for explaining their economic policy guidelines so clearly both here and in the documents."
"I know that they have been the subject of much controversy for many years."
"Today we have the euro, and today no one is disputing the fact that their proposals are right nor that Mr Menrad's report, which covers the employment policy side, is a very good report, which can be debated here alongside the Fourçans report."
"Listening to Mrs Randzio-Plath, I do wonder whether she has actually already given up on the stability and growth pact."
"After all, she has repeatedly stressed these points in the committee as well."
"I think it is absolutely essential for the three most important aspects to be respected, that is the stability and growth pact, a wage policy geared to productivity, and the need for structural reform."
"In recent weeks and months, we have discussed what economic and financial strategy is right for the euro zone time and again."
"Article 105 of the EU Treaty leaves no room for ambiguity here."
"As far as the European Central Bank's tasks are concerned, economic policy is clearly secondary to price stability."
"Should we step up coordination of economic policy?"
"Yes, that is also laid down in the Treaty."
"Should a conventional interventionist economic policy à la Keynes be pursued to control the economy?"
"No!"
"Chronic unemployment in Europe will not be eliminated by means of a European employment programme or by the Member States in the European economic and monetary union having a uniform economic policy, but by means of structural reform."
"There can be no doubt that the stability pact was right, is right and will continue to be right."
"I see that Mr Diller, Parliamentary State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Finance, is with us."
"Your former boss, Mr Lafontaine, came up against a brick wall in Europe with his ideas on this subject, did he not?"
"Basically, he failed."
"It is true that monetary policy should not be obstructive to economic and financial policy."
"Of course it is also true that if there are stable interest rates, stable prices and low interest rates, Member States will have considerably more scope to eliminate chronic unemployment than they had before."
"It is therefore necessary not to ease budgetary discipline; to do so would not be prudent, as Mr Herman has emphasised."
"On the reform measures, several colleagues have mentioned flexible labour markets."
"Mrs Van Lancker spoke about the pension system."
"I think that Germany, which has a pension system funded by contributions, will actually experience serious difficulties in the long term, and that in one generation it will simply not be possible to build up a fund system to run alongside the contributions system."
"Very wide-ranging structural reforms are therefore required, which must prevent problems also being caused by the State placing too great a burden on GNP, unduly high taxes and social and benefits policies making excessive demands."
"If coordinating economic policy triggers a process of learning and competition, with people asking 'How do the other countries actually go about this?' then this will achieve more than illusionary spending programmes."
"Competition between the countries in the euro zone will call many traditional systems into question."
"I believe that this is right and proper!"
"Madam President, we have two good reports here, but what counts most for us is a strong economy which really does something for jobs."
"We have the internal market and we have EMU, but Europe needs more."
"I should like to focus today on unrestricted fiscal competition."
"With help from the Commissioner, we have achieved some progress here, but the Council is not doing enough."
"It is the Council which is dragging its feet on a number of very important issues, for example switching labour costs into environmental and energy taxes, and now it seems that this dossier too is being blocked."
"It is precisely these areas which offer great opportunities."
"At my instigation, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs produced a report on production levies and green taxes, and this shows that the introduction of this kind of taxation at European level could have a major impact on jobs."
"I would urge the Commission to read this report by Parliament's research departments."
"Worker mobility continues to be hampered by the fact that earned income is taxed twice by virtue of the different treatment given to allowances and taxation in the Member States."
"I therefore think that with regard to social security and pensions, it is very important to pursue convergence between the Member States."
"I am not advocating the imposition of European legislation 'from the top down', but efforts towards convergence can certainly be made 'from the bottom up', and that will most definitely be needed if we are to secure the financial future of our ageing populations."
"I would make the point once again that a huge demographic shock awaits us, and that the European Union needs to coordinate its policy for coping with this."
"Mr President, the Commission report on current general trends is a qualitative improvement and places special emphasis on employment by stressing the need for real structural changes."
"Furthermore, in addition to these general trends, it mentions each specific country in turn - acknowledging that each country has its own peculiarities - addresses the issue of the growth of its economy and puts forward the necessary reforms."
"This change was necessary, and I would like to point out that it is in keeping with the flexible interpretation and orientation of the criteria contained in the Treaty and which I have time and again supported."
"The very existence of economic and monetary union demonstrates that this is not just a formality. On the contrary, it addresses economic and monetary issues in a dynamic way and calls for the coordination not only of the monetary but also the economic and social policies of the Member States of the European Union."
"We must bear in mind that this flexibility must also extend to the structural framework."
"If general economic policies are not coordinated, monetary policy will be ineffective and will not have the desired validity to enable the currency of the European Union to play its true role."
"In these circumstances, therefore, we must avoid any potential split within the European Union and we must aim to incorporate all Member States into EMU as quickly as possible."
"Only in this way will it be possible to achieve the more effective, comprehensive, coordinated reforms that the Commission is calling for."
"And only in this way will we be able to have real economic and monetary union, as envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty."
"I therefore welcome the statement made by the Commission on this issue, which seems to open the way for a more rational and more effective economic approach, the main characteristics of which are quite rightly highlighted, discussed and enhanced by our rapporteur, Mr Fourçans in his excellent piece of work."
"Mr President, this joint debate on the broad economic policy guidelines and the European Employment Pact is to be welcomed."
"You could say that this represents progress towards examining or at least debating the view that unemployment can only be combated with economic policies aimed at job creation."
"Well, you could say that."
"But this afternoon's debate will not only pass by virtually unnoticed, it will be regarded as the unprepared introduction to a week full of events which would engulf any debate, let alone one on economic guidelines and employment."
"We expect something to come out of Cologne. There must be a joint debate on economics and unemployment."
"In particular, the summit participants must be receptive to the marches which will take place against mass unemployment, precarious employment, social exclusion and the other forms referred to in the Menrad report. They must not dodge this issue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a sound economic policy, which gives companies breathing space, is the best way to create more jobs."
"Last year it was possible to bring unemployment down to 10 %."
"This pleasing, though by no means adequate trend cannot, however, as claimed in many quarters, be attributed to the employment policy measures taken by the Union."
"The realisation that the efforts made by the Union hitherto, including the NAPs, have been insufficient and have had little success is another reason why this Employment Pact is necessary."
"If we wish to take a positive view of these reports, then we can say that we have recognised the problems and have ideas about how to tackle them."
"But ideas and an awareness of the problem alone will not create a single job."
"The will and the ideas are there, but there is a big gap when it comes to implementing the measures."
"There are only limited ways in which the Union itself can create jobs."
"This is the task of the nation states and companies, in particular the SMEs on which we must focus all our attention."
"Creating one new job costs around ATS 1 million in my national currency."
"Since 1989, therefore, the appropriations in the Structural Funds alone could have created six million jobs!"
"But these jobs are nowhere to be seen, declared the President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Friedmann."
"The Employment Pact ..."
"The President cut the speaker off"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is astonishing - or perhaps it is not - that today's debate is in fact being used as a platform for expounding different views on both economic policy and social and employment policy."
"It may not be quite so astonishing, because unfortunately the election campaign has of course already started; were this not the case, then perhaps the speeches would have turned out somewhat differently."
"Mr Menrad has tabled a good and reasonable report which my group can also support, provided our amendments are accepted."
"He is right that we do not need to start from scratch with everything."
"We have experience at national level in a few Member States, but at European level, formulating the Employment Pact and implementing it is new territory."
"The national action plans were also new territory, and unlike the previous speaker, I strongly believe that the Luxembourg guidelines and the national action plans have contributed to the fall in unemployment."
"Of course more needs to be done; no one is disputing that, and it is mentioned in both reports."
"Although I am largely in agreement with you, Mr Menrad, I should like to mention a few further points on which our views differ, and nor do I think that the German Government has such a narrow view on this as you described, Mr Langen."
"We obviously welcomed the stability pact, but an additional stability policy which strangles public budgets, robbing them of all political room for manoeuvre and making it impossible for them to create the necessary basic conditions in education, research and training, is no good to anyone."
"That is not the kind of stability pact that we had in mind."
"Nor is it sufficient - and Mrs Van Lancker is right here - for the ESF to be our only source of funding for employment policy; in any event, that is another matter which will have to be dealt with in the next parliamentary term."
"Finally, I should like to give the German Presidency, which will be presenting the Employment Pact in Cologne, something to think about: please bear in mind that as a parliament, we obviously expect to be involved in this."
"Mr President, I have said before in this House that inequality and injustice in Europe divide those who have work from those who stand no chance of feeling any sense of participation, earning their own living or developing their potential."
"We are now discussing reports by three of my colleagues in the PPE Group."
"I should like to congratulate them on a constructive outcome."
"We should allow Mr Fourçans' prescription for a sound economic policy to form the basis of the medicine the European labour market needs."
"Mrs Thyssen's contribution, which concentrates on labour-intensive services, is unfortunately still required."
"There is clear proof that high taxes are discouraging an above-board, expanded market in services."
"The information, white collar and services sectors are underdeveloped in Europe compared with the USA, for example."
"In point of fact, this is the area in which tomorrow's jobs lie, which we cannot afford to tax out of existence."
"Consequently, extensive structural reforms are also needed in the different European markets."
"The common market should be realised and exploited to its full potential."
"Monetary union increases pressure on competition but, properly handled, it can also increase European competitiveness and prosperity."
"My thanks also go to the Commission, in particular to the present Commissioners, who have tirelessly focused on the lack of dynamism, the need for change and, in particular, on the role of national governments and parliaments in undertaking measures to reduce fiscal pressure, stabilise public finances and improve the labour market and training methods in the different Member States."
"Let us use the European Union to create the right conditions for entrepreneurship, growth and new jobs - not to regulate the jobs we need out of existence or to sit here and believe that we can redistribute and 'talk up' the new jobs and tomorrow's opportunities in this Europe of ours."
"Mr President, both the Commission's recommendation and Mr Fourçans' report are based on an essentially fallacious idea, namely that of a uniform economic policy."
"We all know that the structure of the economy differs widely in the various Member States."
"When countries have such different structures, as is the case in the Union, imposing the same economic principles results in disagreement and conflict."
"If one wishes to achieve harmonisation, however, the policy should instead take account of national differences and be adapted to the national structures."
"The Union should finally stop allowing itself to be guided by abstract theories on harmonisation which bear no relation at all to hard and fast reality!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is somewhat surprising that the European Union, on the one hand, is engaged in a well organised debate on the broad economic policy guidelines, with all the known constraints and a rigorous stability pact, and on the other hand, has an employment policy with only vaguely defined guidelines. And this is in spite of constant assertions that employment is the biggest issue facing Europe and Europeans."
"We should firstly like to see the European institutions fall into step and bring the two facets of economic policy and employment policy together."
"However, it is clear that if we do not get out of the rut we are in, there will not be sufficient growth to reduce unemployment."
"The European memorandum proposed by the French and Italian Ministers for Employment explicitly urges the European Union to set itself a 3 % growth limit for the next few years."
"However, this will not be possible without tough decisions."
"So what type of decisions can we expect?"
"First, we will need a policy to boost major initiatives as advocated by Jacques Delors."
"Frequent reference is made to this type of proposal but no specific financial and operational commitments are ever really made."
"Second, if growth is to receive a boost, internal demand must be supported."
"I should like to remind you that growth in the United States is heavily reliant on internal demand."
"There is certainly no miracle for achieving this: if internal demand is to recover, wages firstly need to be supported."
"Therefore, the policy of wage moderation, which has all too often prevailed, needs to be reversed."
"Furthermore, productivity gains and wage increases must go hand in hand."
"Consumer tax must be reduced, and we believe that VAT should also be lowered, particularly in those sectors that create a high number of jobs."
"Lastly, public investment must be given a fresh impetus, for example, in the major initiatives mentioned earlier and also in research."
"These grand declarations that welcome the reduction in state aid to companies still give cause for concern because there is an unwillingness to accept at the same time that the majority of these large privatised companies no longer invest in vital research or in research and development and as a consequence stunt our technological development."
"To conclude, the issue of employment does not boil down to the issue of growth, however essential it might be."
"Since the dawn of civilisation we have worked less to produce more and I do not see why this secular movement should stop."
"It is time for a new stage in terms of a reduction in working time, which should provide the opportunity to better distribute the wealth produced."
"Europe may indeed suffer from high unemployment, but it has never been as wealthy."
"The problem is that this wealth is poorly distributed."
"We therefore need to create a fairer tax system, as harmonisation is not enough."
"There should be greater tax on capital and less tax on labour."
"We need to invest in the future through public investment in major initiatives and research."
"Working time must be reduced and alongside this reduction we must train our workforce."
"The national employment plans are very positive from this point of view."
"Our opinion, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, is that it we have not achieved the right balance."
"Today we have 13 Socialist-led governments whose electorates, like the peoples of Europe, expect them to implement a policy that not only helps employment but also creates a social model that is not based on insecurity."
"Mr President, the advent of the euro has also changed the general guidelines for economic policy."
"Independence is no longer an option, now that eleven countries of the European Union form one monetary zone with a single central bank and a single monetary policy."
"The economic policy mix urgently needs to be decided now at European level. And it will be."
"The question is simply whether or not political considerations will play a sufficiently active part in that."
"Against the background of the need for an active European policy mix, I am perplexed by the Commission's proposal for general economic policy guidelines."
"Instead of moving us forward, the Commission is pushing us back."
"Why?"
"Whilst the European policy mix has hitherto consisted of recommendations for national budgetary policy, the monetary policy of central banks and the wage policy operated by the social partners, the birth of the euro has evidently prompted the Commission to stop giving monetary policy any active role in the overall European policy mix."
"It is as if governments and the social partners could determine economic policy on their own and as if the ECB did not also have a role in supporting economic policy."
"There is a history to this debate, and I put it to you that the Commission is setting itself up here as a kind of secretariat for conservative forces within the ECB which argue that the ECB's second duty under Article 105 of the Treaty, namely to support economic policy - without prejudice to the maintenance of price stability - can be discharged simply by maintaining a sufficient degree of price stability."
"I would refer you to the policy strategy outlined in the ECB's first monthly report."
"Happily, however, ECB President Duisenberg made it clear at last Monday's latest parliamentary hearing that the interest cut of 8 April was precisely an attempt to help kick-start the Union economy, in other words he acknowledged in so many words that monetary policy too has an economic function."
"So I think it is a big mistake - fortunately identified as such in the Fourçans report - to reduce the policy mix to nothing more than tasks to be performed by government and the social partners."
"No, that is not on. You have to return, Commissioner de Silguy, to a policy mix in which monetary policy also plays its part in influencing economic policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to point out that I intend to focus on issues relating to the broad economic policy guidelines, or BEPG, and Mr Mario Monti will deal with the other report, that is, the Menrad report on the European Employment Pact."
"I should firstly like to congratulate Mr Fourçans on his excellent report and on the excellent work he has accomplished within such a short space of time, something I should also like to congratulate you on."
"The BEPG constitute both a vital and key instrument for the effective coordination of economic policies in Europe. This, Mrs Lienemann, certainly puts employment at the top of the priorities of the European governments, but it is also high among the priorities of the Commission and, of course, this House."
"The Ecofin Council will examine the BEPG on 10 May, before they are ratified by the Heads of State and Government in Cologne at the beginning of June."
"Mr Metten, I have already given a detailed presentation of the Commission's recommendation to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and, bearing in mind the limited time available this evening, I should like to concentrate my speech on responding to your rapporteur's questions and comments and to the other points that have been raised this evening."
"To make things easier, my comments shall focus on two areas: the present economic situation and the implementation of the broad economic policy guidelines."
"First, the economic situation in Europe is improving, albeit slowly."
"In spite of the uncertainties recently reflected in public opinion polls, the present outlook is favourable and the economic essentials of the European Union are becoming healthier."
"Proof of this lies in the positive outlook for consumption and household confidence."
"The slow-down in world growth only has a limited and temporary impact on growth in Europe."
"Growth in Europe is set to speed up during the year to reach an annual rate of between 2.5 % and 3 % by the end of 1999."
"Recent monetary developments, Mr Metten, are boosting the confidence of economic agents and should have positive repercussions, particularly for private investment. However, as you are well aware, I never comment on the decisions taken by the European Central Bank, so as to avoid being accused of undermining the sacrosanct principle of independence."
"The employment situation is improving, although it is certainly not improving fast enough, Mrs Moreau."
"I listened carefully to what you said, Mrs Van Lancker, and looking at the figures, I see that employment is set to increase by 0.8 % in 1999 and by 0.8 % in the year 2000."
"It increased by 1.1 % in 1998."
"The projected increase is very small, but it is proof that Europe's unemployment curve has been reversed and that our growth is generating more jobs."
"Of course, this is still not enough and that is precisely why the broad economic policy guidelines have been presented: they enable us to put forward an economic strategy that has been pursued for several years and that has been adapted, and as your rapporteur pointed out, there is no reason why we should change the present economic strategy."
"Instead, we should follow the same course and step up the action taken to support growth and combat unemployment."
"The Commission welcomes the support that your rapporteur has given to the strategy advocated in the recommendation on the broad economic policy guidelines for 1999."
"I shall not go back over this."
"There is just one point regarding structural reform that I should like to highlight so as to demonstrate the Commission's willingness to assess the liberalisation of the telecommunications, transport and energy sectors."
"An analysis of these network industries will soon be published and the Commission has no objection to the use of best practices in national legislation where company rules are concerned."
"My second set of comments relates to the implementation of the broad economic policy guidelines."
"Mr Metten, far from being a mere secretariat of the Council, the Commission this year put forward recommendations for each country."
"In doing so, it aims to ensure that the broad guidelines are a sufficient test to demonstrate Member States' willingness to specifically coordinate economic policies, Mrs Lienemann, by using the instruments they have established for this purpose."
"I should like to add, for Mr Christodoulou's benefit, that the broad guidelines apply to all 15 Member States, even though some of the provisions of the Treaty are limited specifically to the euro zone."
"In my view, this coordination mainly involves two aspects."
"Although Mrs Boogerd-Quaak brought up another issue, that of the ageing of the population, I should just like to mention two aspects very briefly."
"The first of these is the budgetary policy."
"I would like to know whether or not the Member States are prepared to accept the specific country-by-country objectives laid down by the Commission."
"In other words, I want to know if some of them are prepared to take regulatory measures to face up to the current developments highlighted by the Commission's recent forecasts."
"These are the real issues the Member States must debate because they lie at the very heart of the process of strengthening budgetary coordination."
"The second issue of concern is employment."
"The Commission's recommendation on the broad guidelines sets out national objectives for structural reform for each Member State. This is something that, as I remember, was mentioned by both Mrs Moreau and Mrs Randzio-Plath, whether in relation to the labour market or a more active employment policy."
"Are the Member States prepared to accept the objectives recommended by the Commission without toning them down?"
"Here again I ask the question."
"In Dresden, the finance ministers were responsible for drawing up a European Employment Pact."
"Mr Mario Monti will answer you on that point and I shall not go into it any further."
"I just wanted to emphasise the fact that following the example of your rapporteur, the German Presidency suggested in this regard that we should promote macro-economic dialogue among all the elements of the policy mix."
"This is why the Commission is proposing that the social partners present a common position to the Cologne European Council and is also recommending that in the future an annual meeting be held with the social partners before the spring European Council which adopts the broad economic policy guidelines."
"Furthermore, within the framework of improving the integration of employment in the economic policy, your rapporteur suggests that we should do away with the present separation of the broad guidelines and the guidelines for employment."
"I think you are right and it is worth asking whether it would not be better in fact to guarantee greater complementarity between the two elements, including in terms of the timetables involved."
"This is something the Commission is considering."
"I shall end by saying that, in relation to the implementation of the broad economic policy guidelines, the Commission sincerely hopes that, contrary to what happened last year, Member States are able, in this first year of the euro, to agree on a specific, limited content for these guidelines, which is operational and which is not toned down, particularly as regards the recommendations for each country in the area of employment policy."
"To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to stress that the Commission gladly supports your proposal to systematically carry out an annual assessment of the way in which the broad guidelines are implemented by the Member States from spring 2000, on the basis of these country-by-country recommendations."
"This would undoubtedly help us to strengthen a genuine European economic policy."
"Mr President, on behalf of my colleague Mr Flynn, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Menrad for his report and by thanking the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for its rapid work on the draft resolution."
"We fully share the views expressed on the European Employment Pact."
"In addition, Mr Menrad has stressed the need to mainstream employment in Community policies."
"This is fully in line with the communication adopted by the Commission on this subject on 21 April."
"By reiterating Parliament's support for the Luxembourg process and correctly insisting on the support which the European Social Fund must give to the European employment strategy, the report and resolution have given timely messages."
"Let us be clear about what we are seeking from the European Employment Pact."
"As requested by the Vienna European Council such a pact should establish a dialogue involving all the actors with responsibility for designing policies which impact on economic growth and employment creation."
"This dialogue should fully respect the autonomy of the various actors and take place at different levels as suggested in the draft resolution before Parliament today."
"As regards macro-economic policy, there should be an exchange of views between the relevant actors on each element in the macro-economic policy mix, fiscal policy, wage trends and monetary policy, so that each can fully support the growth and employment process."
"As the Amsterdam Treaty and its Article 127 enter into force, there should be an assessment of the impact of all relevant policies on employment."
"In our recent communication on this issue, the Commission outlined how a range of policies can promote a high level of employment and how policies are increasingly being directed towards this objective."
"The Communication deals, for example, with ways of encouraging and supporting investment in capital and human resources in order to strengthen the European Union economy."
"It examines how structural reforms can make markets work better and thus help achieve sustainable growth and employment."
"It refers to the modernisation of social protection and of taxation systems in order to improve work incentives and opportunities for entering or returning to the labour market."
"We are pleased to find that all these points are referred to in the draft resolution."
"Further practical steps will be needed to assess how the various Community policies can contribute more to the employment objective and, where necessary, be refocused to ensure that they do just that."
"It is vital that the Employment Pact should consolidate the key role of the Luxembourg process."
"What is important now is to strengthen the employment guidelines so that they deliver their full potential as a powerful instrument for labour market reform."
"We have the right to expect that the national action plans presently being drafted by the Member States will be more ambitious than last year."
"And as we come to evaluate the impact of the national action plans later this year, two years after Luxembourg, we will be in a better position to assess whether the strategy is working or whether more effort is required in certain areas."
"You are right to stress that the European Social Fund must play a key role in support of the European employment strategy."
"We understand therefore very well why the draft resolution suggests a return to the Commission's proposal for the funding of Objective 3 activities in 2000-2006."
"However, we cannot forget the broader budgetary context."
"We are not unhappy with the way in which the European Social Fund and the employment strategy have been treated in the Berlin settlement."
"Let me now turn to your discussion on the link between the employment guidelines and the broad economic policy guidelines."
"In Vienna the European Council called for greater synergy between the two processes and the Commission responded to this request with its latest broad economic policy guidelines and its Article 127 communication."
"However, do not forget that the Luxembourg process is still very new."
"The Member States have created new working arrangements to implement their national action plans and to report on them."
"We are learning together to work a process of peer pressure and open evaluation."
"It should be allowed to gain momentum: a change in timetable at this early stage could be disruptive."
"It is clear that our approach to employment must cover macro-economic, as well as micro-economic, policies and must address problems which arise not just in labour markets but also in the product and capital markets."
"The creation of such a comprehensive approach and a dialogue between all the actors involved is the core of the proposed employment pact."
"These are issues of substance not timetabling."
"We hope the pact will be a step towards a better integration of macro-economic, employment and structural policies."
"I should like to conclude with two or three remarks on points which I found particularly interesting in the course of the debate."
"Several speakers - such as Mr Blokland and Mr Langen - drew attention to the ageing population problem."
"Under Commissioner Flynn's initiatives, the Commission has looked into the problem of the future of social security and, I am glad to say that, at the further and recent instigation of both the German presidency and the European Parliament, we will come forward very soon with a communication on pension funds, drawing the conclusions from the Green Paper exercise."
"A number of speakers - including Mrs Randzio-Plath, Mrs Boogerd-Quaak and Mrs Van Lancker - touched upon the taxation aspects."
"Let me simply say that in spite of the inevitable difficulties due to the unanimity rule, it is undeniable that now, under the strong urging of the German presidency and with the support of this Parliament, progress is being made in the implementation of the strategy against harmful tax competition and a number of objectives have been set for the Helsinki European Council."
"As far as the more specific proposal, dear to many of you, about the reduced VAT rate on labour-intensive services is concerned, I am glad to note that today under the German presidency the first meeting of a Council working group on this subject took place, and later this evening we shall be debating the Thyssen report on this very topic."
"Lastly, Mr Blot, I do not share your fear that fiscal coordination, following monetary union, might eliminate one of the two remaining options for implementing a policy against the famous asymmetric shocks."
"I think you can rest assured since the notion of fiscal harmonisation, as proposed by the Commission and unanimously adopted by the Ecofin Council and as supported, among others, by the rapporteur, Mr Fourçans, is certainly not an advanced notion of harmonisation."
"I would instead call on you to consider the problem in the following terms: if there were no coordination of fiscal policies, given the present level of market integration, the Member States would increasingly lose their sovereignty to anonymous markets and they would therefore have less and less opportunities to implement an effective fiscal policy."
"Mr President, it is interesting that the Commission is speaking through the mouths of two Commissioners."
"It is a pity that they contradict each other."
"Commission de Silguy defended monetary policy not being an element of the policy mix, while Commissioner Monti referred to monetary policy as an important element of the policy mix."
"Can I have an explanation from the Commission?"
"In my view, there is no contradiction."
"The Commission only has one position regarding the broad economic policy guidelines, which it set out in a recommendation that it adopted unanimously."
"I should like to remind you that this recommendation on the policy mix defends a balance of budgetary policy, wage increases and structural policy."
"With regard to monetary policy, if this year's presentation seems different compared to last year's, it is due to the fact that, unlike last year, we now have an independent European Central Bank and the Commission does not think it appropriate to interfere in this principle of independence."
"Having said that, the Commission reserves the right, both this year and next, to carry out all the analyses and make all the comments it deems necessary to guarantee that the policy mix is as balanced and relevant as possible in order to ensure sustainable growth that does not cause inflation and that creates jobs in Europe."
"Mr Metten, I would simply like to confirm exactly what Commissioner de Silguy said."
"In the text that I read out on behalf of Commissioner Flynn I see no contradiction whatsoever with the position expressed by the Commissioner responsible."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Fraud Investigation Office"
"The next item is the report (A4-0240/99) by Mr Bösch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the amended proposal for a Council Regulation concerning investigations conducted by the Fraud Prevention Office (COM(99)0140 - C4-0180/99-98/0329(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have always been convinced that in the end the European Union and its institutions would emerge from the crisis of the past weeks and months stronger."
"By setting up OLAF, the new European Fraud Investigation Office, we shall make a visible contribution to this."
"I think it is a good sign that the legal base for OLAF will be one of the first texts to be adopted under the new procedures of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"This would certainly not have been possible had not all those involved - the Council, Parliament and, after initial hesitations, the Commission - collaborated on this project in a very constructive spirit."
"My thanks therefore go to all those who have been and still are members of the high-level group of representatives of our three institutions at both technical and political level."
"In my capacity as Parliament's rapporteur, I should like to mention three of the participants by name and express my sincere thanks to them: my committee chairman, Mrs Theato; a courageous friend from my group, Mrs Wemheuer; and my tireless assistant, Mr Schönberger."
"I now turn to the proposal itself. We have put together a package consisting of three components."
"The first component is the Commission decision to establish OLAF, an office which, although located organisationally within the Commission, is guaranteed to be independent of the Commission and to be free to take its own decisions when conducting investigations and enquiries."
"The Commission adopted this decision last week."
"The second component is the Council and Parliament regulation laying down how the investigations are to be conducted and what should happen with the results."
"This regulation is the centrepiece of the package."
"It covers external investigations in the Member States and internal investigations within all the EU institutions."
"Briefly, these are the most important points which we wish to incorporate in it: firstly, the Director of OLAF has a free hand in the investigative work."
"In this context, he may not accept instructions from any party."
"He may open investigations at the request of a Member State or an institution, but may also do so on his own initiative, and he has the right to lodge complaints with the European Court of Justice if he finds that his independence is compromised."
"We included this point on the express recommendation of the Court of Auditors, whose opinion has incidentally been of great assistance to us in eliminating any remaining inconsistencies from the texts."
"Secondly, the Director is under a specific obligation to inform and call in the competent national judicial authorities if Office staff working on internal investigations come across facts which might relate to matters open to criminal charges."
"OLAF is not therefore about replacing or circumventing national public prosecutors and judges."
"Nor is OLAF a way of setting up an EU police force by the back door."
"What it is about is carrying out administrative investigations - if you like, preliminary investigations - which should allow the police and public prosecutor to do their job."
"Thirdly, OLAF will be subject to monitoring by independent, external experts."
"The German version of the text rather unfortunately still refers to a scrutiny committee."
"The English version captures the meaning much better."
"It uses the term supervisory committee."
"Here we particularly have in mind experienced experts in criminal law or high-ranking civil servants from the relevant bodies in the Member States such as the Guardia di finanza or the British Serious Fraud Office."
"It is not intended that this committee should interfere in the Director's everyday work, but that it should ensure, by carrying out ex post controls, that no mistakes are made."
"All of this and more - on which I cannot enter into detail in the short time available - is therefore part of the regulation."
"I now turn to the third component, the institutional agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission on internal investigations."
"This is the subject of another report, which was adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control today, shortly before the beginning of this debate, and which will be put to the vote along with the report on the regulation this Thursday."
"All of the other Union bodies, institutions and agencies are specifically invited and requested also to enter into this agreement."
"This is necessary for OLAF to be able to conduct investigations within them."
"In addition, it is stipulated that officials and other EU employees are obliged to inform their superiors - and, if they think it necessary, OLAF - directly and without delay of any facts which might allow cases of fraud, corruption or similar crimes to be closed."
"It is not only the staff but also the members of the institutions and bodies who will cooperate fully with OLAF."
"At this stage there can be no exceptions, as this would cause us to lose credibility."
"However, neither can our independence as Members of Parliament be threatened."
"It is precisely with our parliamentary immunity in mind that a number of sensitive issues remain to be clarified."
"This was not part of the negotiations and nor could it be."
"It is no longer possible for this Parliament to make any over-hasty decisions on this either; it will be a matter for the newly elected Members."
"Finally there are several points which, although they are also to be decided by the newly elected Parliament, are matters on which we ought to make progress in the high-level group over the next few weeks, and if possible by the ECOFIN Council on 25 May."
"We need a proposal for the five members of the supervisory committee to which everyone can agree; we need a job description for the Director of OLAF so that the job advertisement can be published; and, as our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets have already recommended in their opinion, we need an establishment plan for OLAF so that a supplementary budget can be agreed on that basis."
"This has to happen very quickly, and it is also the decisive test of our credibility."
"OLAF must actually be up and running by the end of the year."
"Mr President, most of us are growing rather tired of hearing about corruption and fraud involving EU funds."
"Hopefully, the forthcoming election campaign will also deal with other important political issues, but the battle over the major reforms should be fought now, while the political will is still present."
"We have succeeded in reaching an agreement on OLAF, and would like to take this opportunity to commend the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, for his outstanding work in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission."
"We have achieved a really good result."
"The new proposal is far better than the original."
"The Office will now be located in the Commission for organisational purposes, but it will be entirely independent as far as carrying out investigations is concerned."
"Its independence will be guaranteed by the fact that the Commission will not have powers to direct the Office."
"The Office will also have powers to investigate irregularities and fraud in other EU institutions."
"The Commission is not the only place where there are problems."
"The Office will have full access to all relevant information, and it will be able to carry out investigations on its own initiative."
"With this proposal, we will hopefully get the best of all worlds."
"We will get an Office which is independent, and at the same time gain an extra benefit by locating the Office within the Commission."
"If the Office is part of the Commission, we will have access to confidential information which it would otherwise not have been possible to obtain."
"We will not have an Office which is hoodwinked, as we have been in Parliament for years."
"If we had instead chosen a solution which involved setting up an entirely new Office outside the Commission, it would have required a change in the Treaty."
"We cannot wait for that."
"It is vital that we have the Office now, and not in two years' time or never."
"By adopting this proposal, we will set up the legal framework."
"But that is far from enough."
"Money must now be made available in the budget for staff."
"We in Parliament have asked for a staff of 300, which is definitely not too many."
"The Office must have the resources to operate effectively."
"Otherwise we would reproduce the problems which result from leaving such an important task to the Commission without allocating the necessary resources."
"When Parliament meets again in the autumn, we shall ensure that sufficient funds are earmarked in the budget."
"We have a huge task here."
"The whole question of what the Office needs cannot be left to the Commission."
"The tripartite committee should be involved in the discussion, and I would therefore like to propose a meeting of the tripartite committee after 25 May, when the proposal will also have been adopted by the Council."
"We can then quickly discuss the appointment of the Supervisory Committee, and then we can elect a Director."
"Then we can get the Office up and running as quick as possible."
"That is what we need."
"Mr President, it will be remembered that one of the touchstones for being able to grant discharge to the Commission for 1996 was the creation of an operationally independent fraud prevention office."
"Parliament laid down some important ground rules for an office of this kind when it adopted the report of the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Bösch report, by a large majority in October 1998 and requested a proposal for a regulation along those lines from the Commission."
"As I see it - and I am not exaggerating - if the Commission had made a reasonable proposal to improve fraud prevention at the beginning of December, then it might have been spared the refusal of discharge shortly before Christmas and thus all that followed."
"Unfortunately, it was the middle of March before an amended Commission proposal which met Parliament's demands was tabled."
"Happily, in this proposal the Commission abandoned the unreasonable idea of entrusting the responsibility for irregularities and fraud to an external agency with, would you believe it, 48 officials, that is one official to protect an average of EUR 2 billion."
"Since then, progress has been extremely quick."
"If Parliament, the Council and the Commission continue to cooperate as well as they have done in recent weeks, then we will even be able to adopt all the legislation for an independent fraud prevention office before the European elections."
"I should particularly like to highlight the constructive role played by Commissioners Anita Gradin, Karel Van Miert and Mario Monti, but I also wish specifically to commend the Council presidency, our rapporteur Mr Bösch and the secretariats of the three institutions for the huge amount of work which they have done."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control has done its homework; it has unanimously reached a common position in agreement with the German Presidency, and has just this minute approved the accompanying interinstitutional agreement."
"If Parliament and the Council keep to this line, then OLAF will be able to enter into force in June."
"The rapporteur has already described its responsibilities."
"I should just like to emphasise its operational independence once again - from an institutional point of view, the responsibility still lies with the Commission; we had to do this to find a speedy solution."
"It is also important that the Director has access to the judicial authorities in the case of matters which may be open to criminal charges."
"However, there is another snag here."
"Our experiences with the national judicial authorities have not been very encouraging up until now."
"To my knowledge, for example, final verdicts have not so far been reached in any of the 27 internal cases of fraud which UCLAF has investigated since 1994."
"In conclusion, I think that our aims in creating OLAF are to make a constructive contribution to better protecting the interests of the EU against abuse, to make prevention a priority, and to recover money which has gone missing."
"Mr President, the new UCLAF - OLAF - is intended to put an end to irregularities, nepotism, corruption and fraud in the EU."
"As far as I am concerned, it is therefore vital that the new Office is free to investigate any matter it wishes and that it has complete independence in deciding whether or not the matter should subsequently be handed over to the judicial authorities, the national courts."
"I think it is crucial for us now to have an investigation office which can investigate circumstances in all the EU institutions."
"That should certainly give it enough to do."
"When I say all the EU institutions, that should also include the European Investment Bank, for example."
"With the accusations which have recently been made, I would expect the Bank itself to have an interest in uncovering everything that is going on there."
"But the European Parliament should also offer its assistance, and there may be examples of tasks which it would be interesting to have investigated, such as the problems surrounding our premises, where there are still a large number of unanswered questions."
"I therefore believe, Mr President, that the new office, OLAF, is a significant improvement of the situation in the EU."
"It gives us a good chance to clear things up and to ensure openness and transparency in all the institutions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, looking at the West's crisis of values, clearly all that was needed for many fraud-related problems to be eliminated was for the Christian commandment of 'thou shalt not steal' to be observed."
"Fraud and theft are now a way of life and are turning into a scientific study. Organised crime is now a fashionable and studied crime, occurring in the best circles, and its sole goal is theft."
"Organisations must therefore be created which are fully prepared and independent. They must have the necessary financial and human resources and be able to act independently."
"But is acting independently actually the ideal given that the legal systems of many Member States are in crisis? For it is frequently the legal system itself, influenced by the executive - since Montesquieu's separation of powers is fast disappearing - which fails to condemn totally blatant cases of fraud in which billions are at stake."
"Anyone, like us, who participated in the Action Committee on BSE and the Committee of Inquiry into Community Transit can say that the ideal of a Europe without borders has indeed been created, but without borders and without control."
"It is clear that this is a temptation and a paradise for organised crime."
"I hope that the solutions put forward by Mr Bösch are supported by the political will which is needed to ensure their total success."
"However, the cooperation of the Member States is fundamental because they are as guilty as the Commission and we should not forget this."
"Mr President, for all of us who have worked to put things in order and find out how taxpayers' money is being spent, it is a step forward to see the emergence of OLAF."
"Its predecessor, UCLAF, has not been in existence for very long, but the major shortcoming of this has already become apparent, namely that in political terms it is under the control of the Commission."
"It is of the utmost importance that OLAF really is independent and has the task of investigating all the European institutions, which is quite an extensive mandate but one which I believe we in Parliament will ensure it actually carries out."
"It is naturally also important for there to be unrestricted access to all material, so that a proper investigation can be conducted."
"This is necessary in order to combat the fraudulent use of the EU's own resources."
"I should like to thank Mr Bösch for working so assiduously on this report, as well as the Commission for withdrawing its first blueprint for OLAF and making a constructive contribution to finding the solution we shall be dealing with this week."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by adding my voice in praise of the effort to establish OLAF, and I have to say that today's sitting is something of a celebration, since those of us who worked on the Committee on Budgetary Control are witnessing the accomplishment of an undertaking on which so much time and effort has been spent, and in which so many issues hung in the balance."
"I must first of all pay tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, who managed to stick to his guns, despite the opposition from within his own group, the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"In the same vein, I have to say that the Group of the European People's Party, as represented on the Committee on Budgetary Control, was fully behind the rapporteur, put up a good fight, and came away victorious."
"Furthermore, what took place, such as our refusal to grant discharge, may be the crowning achievement of the efforts of this Parliament, whose term comes to an end this week."
"We will all be remembered for the effort we made to clean up the economy of the Community, and the establishment of OLAF will have a prominent place at the heart of this endeavour."
"Having said that, I in turn hope that this office will prosper, and for this to happen the old confrontations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council are of no import."
"But we must all tend this plant which is just beginning to take root, so that it can bear fruit for the good of the European Union, its economic and, above all, its fiscal policies."
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, I should have spoken earlier but as I was otherwise engaged I would like to thank the Presidency for giving me the opportunity to take the floor now."
"In my brief comments I am particularly keen to highlight the important role played by Mr Bösch who - even at times when it was not all that easy to make any headway with this idea - has always been very consistent in maintaining the need for an independent body, given the serious nature of the events which have occurred and the difficulties of tackling them."
"I would also like to draw your attention to the many years of work done by the committee and by Mr Theato in order to establish a role for Parliament enabling legality and transparency to be improved."
"The cooperation provided by the Committee on Civil Liberties and the reports we have produced have also played a part here."
"On this report too, although we only played a minor role, we wanted to draw up an opinion which was consistent and in harmony with all the work done over the years."
"We set out a short to medium-term solution, but we also - on the basis of Article 280 - mentioned a possible later development."
"In fact I believe that the political legacy we have acquired - the independence of the Office - is one which should first be put into practice and then adapted and improved later."
"We know that only an Office which is independent in its internal and external investigations can allow us adequately to combat the developments which have threatened to overwhelm our institutions."
"I would add, however, that it is also highly important to monitor the Office's organisational capacity."
"Woe betide us if a bureaucratic mentality were to destroy what should be a fresh new development: it is a new departure in institutional terms and this should also be the case when it comes to getting results."
"May I conclude, Mr President, by giving my particular congratulations to the colleagues to whom we are most indebted for this work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 15 March 1999, under my chairmanship, the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers adopted a clear position: no leniency, zero tolerance of fraud and corruption in the Community."
"Abuse of the money which belongs to the people of the Union damages the Community's reputation; headlines about it weaken public support for integration and push the Union's successes into the background."
"That is why the creation of the new Fraud Investigation Office is a great opportunity for the Community and an important objective of our presidency."
"The Council, Parliament and the Commission can hereby demonstrate their will and ability to protect Community resources effectively."
"If we succeed in setting up the Office by 1 June this year, as planned, then this will be an important sign, and the fact that this is just a few days before the European Parliament elections will lend it a particular significance."
"I believe that we have managed - in close cooperation with the European Parliament - to produce a workable blueprint."
"I should like to single out three aspects of this."
"Firstly, the proposal you have before you ensures that the Office will take effective action wherever the interests of the Community are at stake."
"The Office has not only been tasked with external control - and this is undoubtedly important, because it is the Member States which administer around 80 % of Community aid - it will also be an independent guardian of Community interests within the bodies and institutions of the Community."
"Many speakers have already pointed out the significance of this."
"Secondly, even though the Office is being set up within the Commission, its operational independence is guaranteed."
"The Director of the Office may not seek or accept instructions from anyone."
"Decisions on opening, conducting and evaluating investigations are his personal responsibility."
"The Commission can only appoint the Director in agreement with the European Parliament and the Council."
"A committee of external, independent individuals will supervise and protect the Director's autonomous running of the Office."
"Thirdly, although public interest is currently focused on uncovering suspected irregularities, prevention is of not inconsiderable importance."
"That is another reason why the blueprint for OLAF is a good start, because the Office is called upon to collaborate on the overall strategy for fraud prevention and will also make its experience available for preventive initiatives."
"With your permission, I will also say a few words on the timetable."
"The Office is meant to be created by 1 June."
"Adoption by ECOFIN is planned for 25 May."
"Afterwards the regulation will be signed by both the President of the European Parliament and the President-in-Office of the Council."
"The accompanying agreement will be signed by the Presidents of the three bodies - Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"The other bodies and institutions are requested to enter into the agreement."
"Finally, I should like to highlight the trusting and constructive cooperation we have enjoyed with the European Parliament delegation, in particular Mrs Theato and the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, and with Commissioner Gradin."
"For all those who have worked on OLAF this has been an encouraging experience, which also bodes well for future cooperation."
"Mr President, Mr Bösch's report and the Commission decision to establish a European fraud prevention office marks the end of a long process starting back in 1995."
"Since then, we have come a long way when it comes to strengthening the tools in the fight against irregularities, fraud and corruption."
"The European tax-payer has every right to expect us to protect their money and to administer it in an efficient way."
"I am fully committed to meet this demand."
"To me it is also a matter of credibility of our institutions."
"I believe that the establishment of the OLAF responds to both these objectives."
"The decision to establish this office is built on a constructive political dialogue between our two institutions and the Council."
"Before I comment on Mr Bösch's report, I want to put the fight against fraud into its right perspective."
"When I took office in 1995 the staff working in the anti-fraud area were still spread around several services of the Commission, with only around sixty staff working in UCLAF."
"Since then, UCLAF's operational capacity has been considerably strengthened and the staff put under one roof."
"Today, UCLAF has 141 staff to deal with around 1000 cases where there is suspicion of irregularities, fraud and corruption."
"The number of cases under investigation has risen continuously."
"This is, of course, regrettable but it is also a sign that we are getting better in our work to fight fraud."
"During the course of last year much attention focused on the 27 internal investigations in the Commission."
"It is often forgotten that the great majority of UCLAF investigations relate to external cases in the Member States."
"I do not mention this to diminish the internal problem in the Commission: just one single internal case is one too many."
"UCLAF works in close cooperation with Member States."
"For instance, in the course of 1998 the total number of cases dealt with by the Member States and UCLAF was almost 5000 cases covering around EUR 1 billion."
"This cooperation is particularly important since there is a growing number of fraud cases that cut across borders, as well as growing involvement of international organised crime."
"The strengthening of UCLAF and its capacity to fight fraud stems from a number of internal Commission decisions."
"As long ago as 1995 I took the initiative to bring together all the anti-fraud activities under the UCLAF umbrella."
"This was followed up in 1997 with a decision to strengthen the independence of UCLAF by, among other things, giving the director the same status as the independent financial controller."
"A new decision in 1998 transformed the office into a taskforce."
"At the same time, units were added to UCLAF to deal with fraud in third countries, corruption inside the institutions, and the legal and judicial cooperation with Member States."
"In July 1998 the Commission decided to further clarify, strengthen and make more transparent the UCLAF mandate."
"The primary aims were to underline the obligations of staff to cooperate in investigations and at the same time to protect the rights of the individual."
"Initiatives have also been taken to improve information about the work of UCLAF."
"In early 1998 the Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, and I, agreed on a procedure to inform the committee in camera on ongoing UCLAF investigations as well as internal audit reports from the financial controller."
"It is in fact UCLAF who brought information as regards suspicion of fraud to the committee's attention and not, as is often believed, journalists having conducted their own investigations."
"One could therefore say that we, too, have been whistle-blowers."
"Despite all these efforts it became increasingly clear during 1998 that one further step was necessary."
"This is why I responded positively in July last year in the Committee on Budgetary Control to further increase UCLAF's independence."
"As a consequence the Commission put forward a proposal to externalise UCLAF's investigation functions."
"One of several important aspects to me was that this would avoid the situation where colleagues would investigate colleagues."
"However, the proposal to externalise UCLAF was not acceptable to the Council and the European Parliament."
"To find a solution a high-level working group was set up at the political level, with participation from Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"Commissioners van Miert, Monti and I participated as the Commission representatives."
"In this context I wish to stress that I found this interinstitutional way to find a compromise very constructive."
"The Commission moved quickly to approve the first result of the work in the high-level group in March."
"I shall not venture into a detailed account of how work progressed."
"It is sufficient to note that the Commission has a adopted a decision to establish OLAF."
"I wish to remind you that the establishment of the new office with the Commission will require resources, as Mr Blak also said."
"The Office will need extra staff and expenditure is bound to increase in light of the broadened scope of operations."
"A request for these additional resources must therefore be expected in the rectifying letter to the budget to be presented later this year to the new Parliament."
"I trust that the budget authorities will receive this request positively."
"Last Wednesday the Commission also took note of the amendments proposed by Parliament in the Bösch report."
"I am very pleased to inform you that the Commission can accept all the amendments in this report."
"The Commission has also approved the draft interinstitutional agreement which will enable the office to conduct internal administrative investigations in Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"I would very much like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, and other Members of the high-level group: Mrs Theato, Lord Tomlinson, Mr Blak and Mr Grosch."
"My thanks also include the Council presidency which has participated in the group with the same positive spirit."
"I believe that this joint process has proven highly effective."
"It could set an example for the way our institutions could work together in other areas in the future."
"I hope that Parliament, in its vote on the Bösch report on Thursday will recognise the important efforts made and the added possibility the OLAF will bring to the joint fight against fraud."
"This would clear the way for the ECOFIN Council on 25 May to take the necessary decisions for OLAF to come into force on 1 June 1999."
"I have always had the interests of the tax-payers foremost in mind."
"With this initiative we are sending a clear signal that all three institutions share this concern."
"With a new OLAF we will have a tool in place that will strengthen our fight against fraud and corruption considerably."
"It is a great achievement for the Union and its citizens."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m."
"Discharge"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0196/99 by Mr Elles, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the accounts of the European Communities in respect of the 1996 financial year; -A4-0201/99 by Mr Brinkhorst, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on postponement of the discharge to be given to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Community for the 1997 financial year; -A4-0199/99 by Mr Fabra Vallés, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge procedure relating to the implementation of the general budget for the financial year 1997: Section I - European Parliament/Ombudsman Annex - Section IV - Court of Justice - Section V - Court of Auditors - Section VI - Economic and Social Committee/Committee of the Regions; -A4-0198/99 by Mr Wynn, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on granting discharge to the Commission in respect of the financial management of the sixth and seventh European Development Funds for the financial year 1997; -A4-0132/99 by Mr Blak, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the management of the ECSC for the 1997 financial year; -A4-0163/99 by Mr Kellett-Bowman, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the special annual reports of the Court of Auditors relating to the financial situation of decentralised Community bodies."
"Mr President, so that the Minutes are correct, I should like to point out that the last letter of my name is an 'r' and not an 'n'."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, I have already had the opportunity of presenting the Council's views on the 1997 discharge procedure to your Budgetary Control Committee on 19 April."
"The Council recommendation to give discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the 1997 budget is being made in spite of the fact that the Commission has already resigned."
"As we know, the immediate cause of its resignation was the report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the responsibility of the Commission and individual members of the Commission for cases of fraud, mismanagement and nepotism which had occurred over a number of years."
"I should like to state explicitly before Parliament that combating fraud is a matter of great concern to the Council."
"The comments accompanying our recommendation to give discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the 1997 budget make this crystal clear and leave no room for doubt."
"In Vienna, the European Council reaffirmed that it attaches great importance to the efficient fight against fraud, corruption and other criminal activity affecting the European Union's financial interests."
"It expressed the wish that the Council - together with the other institutions - should successfully complete its examination of the proposals on the table before the Cologne European Council in June."
"I should like to confirm that our presidency is trying to have the so-called OLAF regulation - which we have in fact just been debating - adopted by the ECOFIN Council on 25 May, and is doing so in extremely close cooperation with you, the Parliament."
"This cooperation - and this has been highlighted by all the speakers - has further intensified in recent weeks because this is a problem of which the general public is aware and it needs to be resolved swiftly."
"There is no doubt that the Council, like Parliament and the Commission, is making every effort to combat fraud, including in particular outside the context of the discharge procedure."
"If I may, I will now return to the actual reason for my being here, the discharge for 1997."
"It is true that the Court of Auditors' report contains a whole host of negative comments on the implementation of the budget - some of which I will be addressing shortly - but it would be over-simplistic to lay the entire blame for the shortcomings which have arisen at the door of the Commission."
"They are partly the result of structural deficiencies to which the Member States have also contributed."
"In making our recommendation, however, we also wish to acknowledge the efforts which the Commission has made so successfully in many sectors to tighten up financial management."
"In the midst of all the criticism, this should not be forgotten."
"Nevertheless, I should like to address a few points where there are particular grounds for criticism."
"Firstly, I should like to stress how important it is to ensure that the internal organisation of the Commission is conducive to the efficient management of programmes."
"For this to be the case, clear objectives need to be set which allow the efficiency of Community actions to be assessed accurately."
"The Council is also very concerned about the fact that appropriations for general information measures and measures to provide the public with information about the European Union are still being utilised without a legal base."
"In addition, the Council is unhappy that there are still numerous irregularities associated with payments made under the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund and for structural measures."
"Nor is it justifiable that, contrary to the Financial Regulation - and I stress, contrary to the Financial Regulation - it is common practice in the field of research in particular to pay advances before the number of participants or the costs of the activities concerned are known."
"Finally, it is regrettable that only a small proportion of the payment appropriations for external aid - and in particular for the priority programmes - has been used."
"As far as the statement of assurance is concerned, the Council is deeply concerned that the Court of Auditors still has not been able to make a statement of this kind because a large number of mistakes are still being made with the implementation of payments."
"Hardly any improvements can be noted on the previous financial year."
"Having made these criticisms, I should also like to make a few more positive remarks."
"The amendments made to the Financial Regulation in November 1998 have enabled financial control to be modernised, in particular as far as the release of unutilised appropriations is concerned."
"But like the European Court of Justice - and probably also Parliament - the Council attaches great importance to the Financial Regulation being thoroughly modernised and completely recast."
"We urgently request the Commission to table proposals to this effect."
"I should also like to draw attention to the measures taken under the SEM 2000 initiative, thanks to which it has been possible to tighten up financial management considerably."
"As the rapporteur for the 1997 discharge procedure, Mr Brinkhorst, emphasises, administrative cooperation both between the Commission and the Member States and among the Member States themselves needs to be stepped up further, given that a large proportion of the budget is implemented by the Member States."
"Of course, this does not alter the fact that the Commission bears the responsibility for implementing the budget."
"When it examined the 1997 annual report of the Court of Auditors, the Council also took into consideration all 25 special reports drawn up during 1998."
"On some of them it jointly adopted specific conclusions, which have been included in the recommendation."
"Finally, I should like to emphasise that the budgetary authority and the Member States need to ensure that taxpayers' money is not only accounted for properly but also used as efficiently as possible."
"The Council is firmly resolved to work towards further improving the financial management of the Community."
"This is a long-term task for all those who are responsible for managing Community funds."
"In conclusion, I should like to mention a few points which played a part in the discussion with your Budgetary Control Committee, Mrs Theato."
"It was suggested that we should hold a trilogue, or at least a dialogue, with you before the Council adopts its recommendation to grant discharge."
"I am sorry, but we are rather hesitant about this suggestion."
"We believe that the Council should first carry out the task which it is assigned in the Treaty of scrutinising the documents, and that only afterwards should we discuss the results with you."
"We do agree with you, however, that the questions which have been raised need to be taken into account during the forthcoming reform of the Financial Regulation."
"Your suggestion to further step up cooperation between national financial experts and between them and the Commission is something which we view favourably."
"I am sure that further suggestions will now be made in the debate which I will then be able to pass on to the Council. Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, I rise to conclude what has been a historic discharge process where nothing has gone according to plan."
"I hope that we will be able to conclude our deliberations on this report this week."
"In doing so, I should like to make a few procedural and substantive points and then some concluding remarks."
"On procedure, I would like to thank those colleagues in the Committee on Budget Control who have contributed towards this whole discharge process."
"This discharge is, after all, one of many, and I happen to be the general rapporteur."
"In December last year the majority of this House refused to grant discharge and it was referred back because there were problems in procedure which have now been sorted out by changing our rules to be in line with those of the Treaty."
"We should now therefore move to a decision on this item."
"We have seen during this process that some people have disapproved of having a discharge which was a political process."
"I understand that particular problem."
"I understand less those who have caused problems in this discharge process because it has been dealing with problems of substance."
"Most of us now realise that it was the right time for this Parliament to refuse to grant discharge because that triggered all the rest of the events which happened in the months afterwards."
"Yet today we see an amendment by the Socialist Group refusing to follow this definitive decision to grant discharge because it still seems to want to continue this process."
"Have they learned nothing from this whole procedure?"
"We should close it down today."
"Moving to substantive items in the report which I submitted and which should now be an annex to this resolution, there were three major items which we highlighted, all of which have been confirmed by the report of the Committee of the Wise Men."
"Firstly, lack of democratic accountability and access to information."
"Secondly, real concern - and it is interesting to read it now after these months have past - about irregularities with Commissioners, and one in particular who, by her inability to resign, caused the resignation of all."
"Perhaps the central feature was the weakness in management structure which was made very clear in paragraph 19 of this attached document which says: 'Weakness in management organisation led to operational distortions in implementing policies'."
"Who knows, perhaps acting President Santer could have saved the Commission if earlier he had stopped running programmes for which he did not have staff."
"Let me look also at one other substantive item in the original report of the 1996 discharge: the reform programme, which the acting President Santer took on board on 11 January in his reform programme of the Commission."
"What has happened to these items now: the codes of conduct we asked for, the revision of the Statute, the nomination of A1 and A2 posts so as to make sure we have high quality at the top of the Commission and the screening report?"
"All these things seem to have come into some murky area somewhere because one or two of the resolutions we have passed recently have failed to be specific on the requests we are putting to the Commission."
"I would like to see these things at least clarified, perhaps by the Commissioner, so that the new Parliament will be able to dispose of these documents."
"Looking ahead, there are two conclusions I would draw from this."
"Firstly, so far as the Commission is concerned, we have a number of ideas which have been part of this reform process."
"Fortunately, in the report on the 1997 discharge, which my friend and colleague, Mr Brinkhorst, will be introducing shortly, we shall see a number of those ideas presented."
"Secondly, I hope that this document will be available to the new Parliament and the acting Commission, and its new President designate, Mr Prodi, so that parliamentarians in a new Parliament have the information they need to ensure the nomination of commissioners is done effectively."
"We do not want to leave the feeling in the Commission with this whole 1996 discharge that we do not rate highly the vast majority of the Commission officials."
"I used to be one myself."
"I am perfectly well aware of the high quality of people there, but we want to make sure that it is always high quality."
"We should not condemn the whole system just because of one bad apple."
"Lastly, it has actually been Parliament above all who has campaigned on this process."
"It is not, I am afraid, the Council."
"It granted discharges."
"It was Parliament coming of age, and it will have to be proven in the new Parliament that we are capable of meeting our responsibilities."
"Mr President, it is clear that the conclusions of this report for 1997 are very specific and very clear, namely, a postponement of discharge on institutional grounds."
"I should like to thank all colleagues."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control wanted to go further."
"It did not want - in terms of the 1996 discharge - to waste time."
"This is not possible."
"We should go beyond that."
"And it is against that background that the Budget Control Committee voted the document which you find as an annex."
"In a sense it is the history after 1996."
"It is also the political nature of this report to put the discharge procedure in a broader perspective."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council just indicated, there are a number of novel features which should be taken into account in future."
"We should not just criticise the past, we should look to the future."
"That is the significance of this particular annex, on the discharge procedure itself, on the information to be given in future."
"There are comments on what has led to the situation just described by my colleague, Mr Elles, a new staffing policy, questions on the BATs, the Committee of Experts' report and also some guidelines for the Commission reform."
"That is why the report consists of more than simply the statement that we should refuse a discharge at this particular time."
"I am very pleased with the comment of the President-in-Office of the Council because part of this report is also oriented towards the new partnership between the Commission and the Member States as well as the cooperation between the Member States themselves."
"I welcome the statement by the Council that it will not fall on deaf ears."
"As the Council executes about 95 % of the budget it is necessary that more action should be taken."
"I hope the time will come when, like in the Committee on Budgets, we will work much more closely together with the Council on budget control."
"We find some specific recommendations on that particular point."
"The Annex basically has three purposes."
"Our purpose is to state from the point of view of Parliament where we stand at the present time."
"It is also an account of what happened after the 1996 procedure."
"Secondly, as Mr Elles has already said, it provides an indication - though we should never seek to govern beyond our grave, certainly not a rapporteur who is leaving this Parliament - to the new Parliament about the kind of issues which can be used to judge the new Commission during the hearings."
"That is an important point in itself."
"It is not binding but it is an indication."
"For that reason it is a contribution from the Committee on Budgetary Control and will not be voted by Parliament as such."
"Thirdly, we want to be a constructive Parliament."
"As Parliament acquires more responsibility and power it should also be a partner, not only in criticising, but also in helping the Commission to carry out its tasks independently but with accountability."
"It is therefore also an element of the work programme for the future Commission which we hope will be taken on board."
"Let me clear up one misunderstanding."
"I had the opportunity of discussing this with Commissioner Liikanen at an earlier stage but I would also like to say it in public."
"It cannot be the role of the Court of Auditors to replace the Commission, nor Parliament."
"Some requests to the Court of Auditors to participate in certain studies should not be seen as taking away the responsibility of action by the Commission or by Parliament."
"But the Court of Auditors has played a very important and useful role in this process between Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"It is against that background that I would like finally to say that it would be useful if the Council itself reviewed its procedures as regards interaction between the Court of Auditors and the national bodies."
"I hear too often that national courts of auditors have a different role, that they cannot fulfil a function within the Community system."
"As we move into a new phase, a new situation where it is not the Commission or the Member States, but the Commission and the Member States, I would call on the President of the Council to study this particular issue of activities between the Court of Auditors and the national auditing bodies in future."
"Mr President, we shall now move on to the discharge of the so-called 'other sections', starting with the first section: Parliament and the Ombudsman."
"In respect of Parliament and the document before us, the large number of cancelled appropriations is striking."
"I should like to make it clear that the reason for this was the delay affecting the D-3 building in Brussels and IPE 4 in Strasbourg."
"Since we are reviewing 1997, which is in the past, I should like to emphasise for everyone's peace of mind that there was a steady improvement in the number of appropriations cancelled in subsequent years."
"As regards aid to democratically elected parliaments in Central and Eastern Europe, 30 % of initial appropriations were not used."
"This, too, may seem surprising, but the reasons for this state of affairs and possible improvements are clear."
"We would like to take the opportunity provided by the 1997 discharge document to draw attention to the fact that the necessary resources should be made available to the Committee on Budgetary Control to allow it to monitor the appropriations granted to the political groups and the expenses incurred by the secretarial services."
"In addition, it is worth emphasising that we are continuing to call for a regulation on the legal status of the political parties in Europe."
"Nevertheless, we request that discharge for 1997 be granted where Parliament is concerned."
"Moving on to the Ombudsman, the 82.1 % implementation rate is of note. I do not wish to imply that this is due to a shortage of staff."
"The department in question is constantly requesting additional staff, but it is certainly worth emphasising that this is a new institution; after all, we are still referring to 1997. It is clear that the budget allocated to the Ombudsman is being used more and more effectively as the years go on."
"Discharge should also be granted in the case of the Ombudsman."
"In the case of the Court of Justice, it is important to mention the advantages resulting from the leasing arrangements concerning the annexes to the Palais. As regards the earlier payments of ECU 50 million, I would like to remind you of a concern we had at the time in relation to the commitments made to Parliament by the Luxembourg Government."
"Back in 1997, we were not certain if these commitments would be fulfilled."
"We really did not know what problems could arise. However, in the light of events in 1997 and later, we must now thank the Luxembourg Government for the excellent work it carried out."
"We propose that discharge also be granted to the Court of Justice."
"Turning to the Court of Auditors, I would simply like to say that in 1997 the usual problems of budgetary inadequacy were satisfactorily resolved, and almost without effort. This was due to the favourable movement in the conversion rate between the euro - then the ecu - and Luxembourg's currency."
"Similarly, we are in favour of granting discharge to the Court of Auditors."
"As far as the Committee of the Regions is concerned, it should be pointed out that budgetary forecasting needs to be improved. In particular, the haphazard programming of activities should be tackled because it means we are constantly being called on to make significant transfers."
"Nevertheless, we are in favour of granting discharge to the Committee of the Regions."
"Finally, there is the Economic and Social Committee, the only area where we do have a problem."
"As you are aware, discharge for the Economic and Social Committee is still pending, awaiting a report by UCLAF."
"Discharge for the Economic and Social Committee is therefore conditional on the findings of the report on its activities which UCLAF - the fraud prevention unit - is due to present."
"We therefore propose that discharge for the Economic and Social Committee be postponed."
"Since this is a joint debate, I do not wish to conclude without stating that my delegation - my delegation and I myself - have already made our position on the 1996 budget discharge quite clear. Further, the resignation of the Commission cannot now be used as an excuse to disregard the commitments made by Mr Santer."
"Mr President, I am going to talk about the ECSC accounts, and I would like to say that this has developed into a success story."
"When I took over the accounts, we had a mass of problems."
"We were swamped with the usual stories."
"Everything was in chaos."
"Who can forget the interest subsidy which ran for ten years, and which we could not end because of foot-dragging?"
"There was a mass of corruption. There was the case of the purchase of apartments when the Commission moved into fine premises in Paris."
"In brief, there was a great deal of confusion, and there was disorder and chaos."
"Then we took matters in hand and we sorted them out."
"I am glad to say that we in the committee have decided today that we are pleased to give a discharge in this area."
"When I look back I think of how, for example, we stood on the verge of possibly losing billions in connection with the Channel Tunnel."
"This appears to have been resolved, and now it is a success story."
"In Denmark, we had a case concerning the Great Belt bridge, where the loan was rather too large."
"There were a few billion to play with, but that case too was sorted out."
"All this is thanks to positive cooperation, and because we were able to obtain information and because we could talk with an excellent Commissioner."
"I would like to commend Mr Liikanen."
"It was possible to talk to him. Every time there was a problem, we went to him and we always got the problem solved."
"So there has been good cooperation in connection with the accounts of the European Coal and Steel Community."
"But there have been problems in another area, the granting and uptake of loans in Europe, which I have been concerned with as part of Mr Brinkhorst's report."
"Here we see some obstinate people who talk down to us - I shall refrain from mentioning the name of the President of the European Investment Bank. Year after year, we have pointed out that we have a right to come and inspect the Bank."
"'It is not your concern', he says. 'We have some small private shareholders, and out of consideration for them you cannot enter, and in any case everything is going well with us.'"
"In my capacity as rapporteur, I have received a piece of paper which says that the Bank has in fact lost billions on failed investments and that the money is hidden in the accounts or has been offset."
"That is unacceptable. It led to me recommending that we should not give a discharge for the 1997 accounts."
"We are sick and tired of lies from people who sit and hide things from Europe's taxpayers."
"We will simply not put up with it."
"Last year, we had problems with the accounts and I refused to give a discharge."
"The committee supported me."
"Then we reached an agreement whereby the Commission intervened and made it possible for us to reach a sensible solution, enabling us to monitor the taxpayers' money."
"More than 80 % of the funds in the various institutions in the European Investment Fund is our money."
"So what did they do when we gave a discharge?"
"They short-changed us, so to speak, and backed out of the agreement, in spite of the fact that we had goodness knows how many meetings and spent goodness knows how much time setting it up."
"That cannot be allowed to go on."
"Let us give a clear signal from this House to Sir Brian Unwin: we are no longer prepared to listen to lies about how everything is perfect."
"This is going to be cleared up now."
"We want to know how DKK 4 to 5 billion can disappear in the accounts."
"It is quite simply an outrageous scandal."
"It may well be as they say that the money is not lost because it may return, because they have not sold bonds."
"We do not want to hear such stories."
"We simply have to say quite bluntly that it is over."
"They cannot have the accounts approved if there is no audit whereby we can go in and check up on the Community's money. So let us end our cooperation with them."
"It cannot be right that we have to pay for everything which they sit and play with, and that they can then play with the profits afterwards."
"We have no wish to see examples of how bond purchases, amongst many other things, are placed with various friends in various places for far less than can be got back."
"This is a real scandal."
"If the Commission can be brought down for as little as it was, these people should have been thrown out long ago so that they never have any chance of returning."
"So here we need to have a powerful Commission which can really go in and check, and we need some people who are willing to cooperate, as Mr Liikanen has cooperated with us, so that we can get this cleared up."
"I would also like to say that I was moved to tears when I heard the Council speak about all the things they would like to do."
"But why do you rubber-stamp the accounts every single year and say that you are making recommendations?"
"You have never applied the brakes."
"I think the Council should take a look at this area, and the new Commission should get to grips with these things."
"There really is something to get to grips with here."
"Mr President, this is the fifteenth time I have moved the discharges, first for Dublin and Berlin, and now Thessaloniki."
"I have to admit that not all the debates have been as exciting and as exhilarating as this one."
"However, these two first-generation agencies are a good example of how control can be exerted by Parliament."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control is very much helped by the European Court of Auditors - and I should like to thank them for their two special reports on these two agencies."
"I should also like to thank the Council which has latterly - and I emphasise latterly because in the early years this did not happen - been putting forward considered recommendations to Parliament to grant discharge."
"One also has to admit that these agencies are small and therefore easier to control, but the cooperation on control really does work."
"Far from resenting control, the agencies welcome the European Parliament's involvement."
"It would help, though, if the second-generation agencies could be treated in the same way."
"Again, I appeal to the Council because Parliament, together with the Commission, has put forward considered amendments to the statutes which would make the situation of the new agencies the same as the old."
"The reports are not long because there is no point in finding fault where faults do not exist."
"The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions had a memorandum of understanding with the Agency for Health and Safety to avoid overlapping, because one of the things Parliament insists upon is that the work of these agencies should not overlap."
"I welcome their attempts to reduce mission expenditure."
"It is rather funny because if you look back a year or two you will find that the Court of Auditors was criticising officials from Dublin who used the weekend as part of their mission - obviously people like to have a trip home at the same time."
"But now they want the members of the agency to use the special pex tickets which are only available over weekends because a Saturday night has to be involved. It is just a change of opinion within the Court."
"I am very happy to recommend discharge for the European Foundation in Dublin."
"I now turn to CEDEFOP which has finally got over that tragic move from Berlin to Thessaloniki."
"I am not attacking Thessaloniki in any way; the fact is that if the Council look up the minutes, they will find it was a mistake to consign CEDEFOP to Thessaloniki in the first place, and the poor Commission and Parliament have been trying to pick up the pieces."
"However, the new building should be ready for occupation in July."
"I wish them well in their new building."
"I can see that the various staffing arrangements are now properly in place and I understand that out of all the staffing of the centre only two A grades remain to be filled."
"I have no hesitation at all in recommending discharge also for CEDEFOP."
"Mr President, I look forward to the day - and I do not think it will be long ahead - when the Court of Auditors is able to give these two agencies a certificate of assurance for 'keeping their noses clean' so to speak and for getting good reports from the Court."
"Mr President, this Parliament will go down in history not so much as the Parliament which brought about the collective resignation of the Commission, but as the Parliament which brought about structural changes, which are already underway, to the organisation and operation of the Commission, the foremost institution charged with pushing forward European integration."
"Appended to the motion for a resolution which you will be invited to vote on tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen, is a working document which enumerates the points that need to be clarified by the Commission, to enable the Parliament that will be voted in following the June elections to grant the discharge for 1997."
"This working document is being held in trust by Parliament to be handed on to the new Parliament."
"I would like to raise one of the points mentioned in this working document, which concerns the famous Regulation 3245/81. This was a joke regulation in the sense that it was adopted, it entered into force, was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, but it was never implemented in practice."
"This regulation provides for the establishment of a European Association for Cooperation to take on the work of a Belgian private law foundation."
"It was never implemented but, despite this, for a number of years it was referred to in Community budgets as the legal base for capital to be made available from the Community budget to fund the activities of this Belgian private law foundation."
"As a result, I hope and I believe - or rather, I am sure - that the structural changes that are currently being made to the organisation and operation of the Commission will make it easy for the next Parliament, which will have the backing of the Commission and will not have to put up with what we have had to put up with over the last three years, to provide explanations and come up with solutions."
"I wish it all the best."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, although the Committee on Development and Cooperation has to grant discharge for the European Development Fund each year, it does not have any influence on how this fund is used because it has not so far been integrated into the budget."
"Governments have repeatedly signalled, before taking up the Council presidency, that they might be able to support integrating it into the budget."
"Later, however, numerous reasons have been found for postponing this decision after all."
"One of the committee's specific criticisms of the 1997 budget is that large amounts are transferred from one Development Fund to the next."
"The suggestion is therefore being made to simplify the management of appropriations."
"With regard to the appropriations for cofinancing, the committee also criticises the fact that individual projects take too long to complete and that the supply of funds in particular often causes huge problems for the non-governmental organisations."
"The Court of Auditors and the Development Committee are waiting rather anxiously to see whether the new structures which the Commission is now introducing will prove to be effective here."
"That is why the Committee on Development and Cooperation requests that a report should be submitted to it next March on experiences with the new structures."
"The committee also takes the view that the response to the procedural shortcomings criticised by the Court of Auditors should be for a minimum degree of competition to be required, in particular in the tendering and award procedures."
"Nevertheless, the committee agrees with granting discharge for the 1997 Development Fund."
"Development cooperation is not one of the areas which voters immediately see as an essential part of European policy."
"We are therefore all the more dependent on financial resources being used transparently and in a way which people can understand."
"Mr President, speaking as the coordinator for the Socialist Group, I want to address my remarks to three of the reports before us today."
"I shall begin with discharge 1996."
"My Group can see no reason not to grant discharge for the 1996 budget."
"In the course of the discharge proceedings and in the light of the Court of Auditors' report, we asked a series of very searching questions of the Commission."
"I am sure that colleagues here are aware that the Commission came back with a series of responses to those questions which, to my Group, were satisfactory enough for us to grant discharge."
"The five questions put down were answered."
"It must be said that from our side we believe that the rapporteur is playing petty party politics with the whole question of discharge for 1996."
"It has taken a great deal of effort to persuade the rapporteur to bring forward a report closing the accounts for 1996 so that we can proceed with the 1997 discharge."
"We do not agree with the wording in paragraph 1, and we wish to delete the word 'definitive' from that paragraph because no vote was ever taken in Parliament on the question of the 1996 discharge, which was recommended by the Committee on Budgetary Control to this House."
"The report was withdrawn and referred back to committee in the light of other events."
"If no vote was taken, we cannot have a definitive report."
"If one good thing has come out of the 1996 report, it has been the access which the Committee on Budgetary Control has had to persons and papers."
"If we are to continue to be an effective Budgetary Control Committee, this must continue in an unfettered way."
"On a more pleasing note, let me move on to my second set of remarks on the 1997 budget."
"My Group will support the report put forward by Mr Brinkhorst, the rapporteur, to postpone discharge."
"We agree entirely with the reasons for postponement; that is there is no Commission in place to receive that discharge."
"In the committee, we have had a long series of discussions on the substantive questions we want both the DGs and the new Commission to address."
"These are reflected in the working document."
"I should like to commend Mr Brinkhorst on the detailed work he has put into this."
"I hope that when the Commission comes back to us in the new Parliament it will take on board and use as a blueprint those questions which are asked in the working document, especially on staffing policies, TAOs, Leonardo and the way in which PHARE and TACIS is operated."
"This is so critical for us to function as a parliament."
"On the comment that Mr Brinkhorst makes on the question of the decentralised agencies - which Mr Kellett-Bowman has picked up - it is essential that the Council address that question, which both Parliament and the Commission have agreement on."
"This brings me to the report by Mr Kellett-Bowman."
"Again, my friend, and I should like to say colleague, has produced two excellent reports on Dublin and Thessalonika."
"He says he has drawn up 15 reports in his time."
"This may well be the last report that Mr Kellett-Bowman draws up on the decentralised agencies."
"I wish to put on public record the high esteem in which I hold him as co-rapporteur on the Committee on Budgets for the satellite agencies."
"He has taught me and has been an excellent colleague, very thoughtful, critical and precise."
"As a lasting memorial to his work, I should like to see the Council now, in recognition of the work he has done, agree to the changes in the statutes for the second generation agencies - changes on the own-resources question, changes on financial control and changes on discharge that will allow Parliament to carry out its responsibilities properly."
"Let that be a lasting testament to his work."
"Mr President, this evening we have a veritable marathon of a debate to complete on discharge reports."
"Six reports are on the agenda."
"I will not comment on all of them, but will turn to the first, Mr Elles's report, which is not actually a discharge report because it proposes closing the accounts for 1996, and I believe that this is right."
"We need to find a way to bring this process to an end, although I do believe that discharge was not given here, because if we look at the result of December's vote, it is clear that the points made previously in support of the decision, the positive decision put forward by the Committee on Budgetary Control, were rejected by the plenary."
"That means that no discharge was granted."
"Our Rules of Procedure were awry."
"Now they have been amended, and there is no need for these matters to arise again."
"We have a precedent for not granting discharge, the 1982 budget, for which the accounts were subsequently closed in 1985."
"That is how we should proceed here; we should, however, also bear in mind all the consequences which this has had politically."
"That is why it does not make any sense from a political point of view to grant discharge at this stage, because we do not have a Commission in office any more."
"It has resigned."
"Nevertheless, there will be no need for us to condemn everything that the Commission has done and neither do we wish to do so."
"Nor have we ever implied that Commissioners were guilty of being directly involved in criminal activities."
"No, but we have established that there is a need for restructuring and that new areas need to undergo a series of reforms which will make us in the European Union fit for the next millennium."
"In this respect, this crisis, which began with the discharge or refusal of discharge for 1996 and the continuation for 1997 - for which we are not recommending discharge either this week, but postponement of discharge - was a necessary crisis, if we think of the positive lessons which we have learnt from it, and which we would have liked to pass on to this Commission, Mr Liikanen."
"But that is not how it has turned out."
"We all know what has happened."
"In both reports, Mr Elles's report, and here I am also bringing in our rapporteur for 1997, Mr Brinkhorst, two points really do need to be emphasised: we have not voted on conditions for giving discharge; we have annexed working documents."
"This is an unusual procedure, but I believe that it was the right approach to take, and these documents contain the suggestions - and indeed the demands - which we are passing on to the future Commission."
"I hope that the new Parliament and the new Commission will make use of them."
"With your permission, I will just add a word to our rapporteur, Mr Fabra Vallés."
"He has produced a very accurate report for the other institutions."
"I do think, however, and here I also have the support of the rapporteur, that we must carry out the same controls here and apply standards in our own House which are just as tough as the ones we have imposed on the Commission."
"That is why the Council and the Commission, but also Parliament, must abide by the decisions we adopted in the Tsatsos report, for example on party financing, and we must also act properly where filling posts and promotions are concerned."
"We owe this to everyone."
"Thank you, Mr President, for giving me the floor once more, and I should also like to thank all the other rapporteurs, whose reports should go through smoothly."
"Mr President, we are now discussing six reports dealing with the subject of the discharge."
"I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work."
"Four reports propose that the discharge should be granted, one that it should be postponed, and one that it should be refused."
"The discharge process for the budget this year has become an immense political task."
"So it was too last autumn and winter, in connection with the 1996 budget, which led to the Commission's resignation."
"Although the process has led to many improvements and positive settlements and solutions, there is a danger that the assessment and discharge process will become inappropriately broad in scope, since the EU's instruments state that Parliament must give a discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget."
"The wording stipulates that giving discharge is the aim, with any obstacles being removed beforehand."
"Discharge is thus the object of the exercise."
"Discharge as a vote of confidence in the Commission is, however, too broad an interpretation, in my opinion, and there are two reasons for avoiding this."
"Although discharge, as it reflects the rules on accounting, is required be granted, Parliament must always be able to intervene in the work of the Commission if it so wishes."
"Giving discharge cannot be allowed to act as a barrier to intervention."
"Furthermore, in the present situation we can see a backlog starting to build up, with the discharge processes relating to several separate years remaining uncompleted."
"Good administration needs to be clear and systematic, and that applies to Parliament also."
"The decision on discharge must not be too ponderous or broad in scope, and it should not lead to a situation in which no one dares to give discharge."
"With these observations I wish to say that the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party supports Mr Brinkhorst's report as it stands and without amendments."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in examining the report by our colleague Mr Brinkhorst on the postponement of discharge for the 1997 financial year, we are not aiming to dwell on the serious grievances that have swamped the Commission in recent years and forced it to resign."
"We are now at the end of a very eventful and stormy period during which the Commission tarnished its image and lost its credibility."
"And yet we must continue, and to continue means to look to the future and take stock of the task in hand so that where there has been defeat, failure and negativity, tomorrow there will be success, transparency and confidence."
"Contrary to what the Council has done lightly and thoughtlessly, we will not grant discharge to the Commission today since, as Laurens Jan Brinkhorst so well explained, discharge will not be granted to a resigning Commission that can no longer advise the European Parliament on future guidelines."
"Postponement is therefore the most appropriate solution technically speaking and in political terms it constitutes something of a peace gesture towards the new Commission. However, it does not dismiss the need for us to remain as vigilant as possible or the need to act with a certain resolve."
"The future message we should like to give to the new Commission involves what we no longer want at any cost and what we do want at all costs. We no longer want a weak Commission that is non-existent politically speaking and that is incapable of controlling and managing its administration."
"We do not want a Commission where the Commissioners are transformed into shepherds that follow their flocks. We do not want a Commission where some officials, who perhaps head an agency with a particular status, turn out to be true petty tyrants of the organisation, imposing their wishes and desires on their Commissioner, who then admits his ignorance of and lack of interest in the issue even when it concerns an amendment to the Community budget adopted by the European Parliament whose implementation does not present any budgetary difficulties or problems relating to the legal basis."
"We had the misfortune to experience such a Commission and it is precisely what we do not want to see repeated."
"I have reread President Santer's speech and I remember that during his investiture in January 1995 he committed himself, in front of this very House, to a genuine culture of financial management."
"In the light of recent events, it is all too easy to see the irony in that today."
"It is clear that nothing has been done."
"The Commission's only reaction has been to take several subsequent measures aimed at filling in the gaps and appeasing Parliament, but nothing has been drawn up or thought out and no ideas have been formed."
"There have been no reforms; the Commission has simply limited itself to promises, preferring rhetoric over action."
"The truth is that the Commission was able to identify the problem of the financial mismanagement of European Union policies, but it was unable to come up with any solutions that it could turn into specific actions."
"The example of SEM 2000 and the installation of the new ROLEX system to manage all external contracts are good examples of this."
"Another example of inefficiency, this time in the area of Community transport, is the computerisation of transit procedures which has met with many delays."
"A final example is that of the technical assistance offices which, as everyone knows, have caused many problems in recent years."
"However, in spite of the European Parliament's insistence, the Commission still appears to be continuing to entrust the TAOs with the preparation of invitations to tender and the lists of projects to be retained."
"The Commission is not to decide on the projects to be retained, but is to ratify the list drawn up by the private consultants, which, in my view, is unacceptable."
"So, in short, this is what we do not wish to see repeated."
"On the other hand, we do want a Commission that takes full responsibility for its actions and choices, that is transparent in its institutional dialogue and that takes on the role of monitoring the operational policies that the services are responsible for implementing."
"Since the Court of Auditors has been drawing up the Statement of Assurance concerning activities financed from the general budget of the European Union, the statement has been negative."
"However, we hope that a new Commission that is politically consistent and responsible will enable the Court of Auditors to finally draw up a positive Statement of Assurance for the first time."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as everyone knows, we must not be too quick to criticise those who are coming to our aid."
"Let us hope that the new Commission will be able to learn from recent events so that it can successfully complete its mandate and so that today's failure opens the way to tomorrow's success."
"We are eagerly awaiting Mr Romano Prodi's arrival in the hope that something good will come of something bad."
"Mr President, I have two brief comments to make. The first one concerns the granting of discharge for 1997 for the Commission and for the Economic and Social Committee."
"It does seem natural to me that this be carried over to the next parliamentary term. However, as rapporteur on the discharge for the Economic and Social Committee for the 1996 financial year, I must stress that discharge cannot be granted until UCLAF has delivered its conclusions on the irregularities detected."
"There is no doubt that efforts have been made to correct these irregularities, even to the extent of altering certain working methods, but this does not justify ruling out UCLAF's intervention."
"Parliament considered at the time that this intervention was essential for granting the discharge and the Council itself has also recently repeated that this is necessary."
"The failure to complete the 1996 discharge clearly means that the 1997 discharge is being delayed."
"I will not go into the discharge procedure for 1996 and the Commission, as I feel that the facts of the matter and the responsibilities assumed speak for themselves."
"Moreover, parliamentary history will do the rest."
"However, I do want to underline my dissatisfaction with the final solution which some are insisting on recommending in order to complete the procedure. It seems to me that this is completely at odds with the facts and the incomparable importance this procedure has assumed."
"Mr President, I should like to concentrate on the Elles report concerning the accounts for 1996."
"From our group's point of view, it is clear that we cannot close the Commission's accounts, since there are still some unresolved cases concerning which the Greens have tabled three amendments."
"It is of course still the case that a sum of nearly EUR 40 000 was paid to a visiting scholar in breach of the Commission's conditions, and this must naturally be looked into."
"Certain unclear points in the Commission's accounts therefore have to be explained before the accounts can be closed."
"We have thus tabled Amendment No 1, in which we give the alternative wording: 'takes note of the following data established by the Commission in order to close the accounts for the financial year 1996'."
"However, we cannot close the accounts."
"I am surprised to see that the Socialists are tabling an amendment which would do away with paragraph 1 of the Elles report, which is the vital one, stating that we recall our definitive decision not to grant discharge to the Commission in respect of the 1996 financial year."
"It should be clear to everyone that this paragraph must remain."
"As regards the Brinkhorst report, the same thing applies, namely that discharge cannot be given until a great deal of missing information is supplied by the Commission."
"The Greens have tabled a number of amendments relating to this report as well."
"Mr President, since the post-war years an insidious practice has grown up in Italy, resulting in even illustrious lawyers justifying the distinction that is made between the constitution as written and the constitution as applied in practice."
"Following a philosophy which can be traced back in particular to the culture of the Communist Party and to an idea of the sociology-inspired left, it is said that, although written texts exist, they can be amended if so desired by the majority or by a dominant group in politics or public opinion."
"This is still considered acceptable: written texts can hence be spirited away because at the end of the day theory takes second place to practice."
"In countries with an Anglo-Saxon legal system, where there is no constitution, it seems to me that the rule of law is the cardinal principle which governs these countries, and indeed governs them much better and has protected them from the type of vision which at any point allows the majority to decide whatever it likes: there are laws, there are texts but that does not matter, you can say something completely different as long as this is what the majority wants."
"And this is indeed the principle which in many countries has led to totalitarianism, intolerance and 'people's democracies'."
"Liberals, who have always taken the rule of law as the cornerstone of their political action, have always based their arguments on the principle that there can be no objection to the texts themselves."
"Now, in our regulatory texts, leaving aside the amendment of the regulation we will be voting on tomorrow, the way in which the budget discharge procedure is regulated is set out in black and white for all to see; one may disagree with it but that is the way it is: if a text is tabled in this House and the proposal to which it refers is rejected, the proposal is referred back to the committee responsible."
"It is extremely serious that this Parliament's final act should be to vote on a text which says something erroneous, or rather states - and in a forum which one might expect to respect the rule of law - that after referring back to committee, in other words rejecting, the proposal by Mr Elles, the rapporteur on the 1996 discharge procedure, that discharge should be granted to the Commission - actually meaning that the European Parliament would not grant discharge - we are today voting on a text which says something entirely wrong."
"On a political level, there may have been the resignations and there may therefore be a majority as far as the form is concerned but that is an entirely separate argument."
"I will fight and vote against asserting something which quite simply is not the case."
"Mr President, I should like to say a few words on the postponement of the discharge for 1997, not least in view of what we have just been discussing, namely that where OLAF is concerned, we have actually found a basis on which the institutions can work together, which is obviously also a good indication of the political will to cooperate that exists."
"We have of course also drawn up a number of special documents on this discharge, in other words on Mr Brinkhorst's report, and I have to say that I am rather irritated that we have not received any response at all from the current Commission to documents which will soon be three months old."
"I know that this Commission has only been an acting Commission for some time."
"However, I am assuming that individual Commissioners might perhaps also wish to belong to the next Commission."
"I think that precisely from the point of view of political understanding, it is very important to realise that Parliament cannot be treated like this!"
"Of course, we do not always expect results of investigations down to the last detail, but we do still have unfinished business to complete. The chairman of the Budgetary Control Committee, Mrs Theato, has already referred today, for example, to the fact that we still have to accept that the cases which were submitted to us of officials being involved in instances of fraud have not yet been presented in a form which we can understand."
"As far as the ECHO case is concerned, we have to take it that this affair could assume even greater proportions, but there is not even any information available on the events relating to 1997 - and it is the 1997 financial year that we are dealing with here."
"The same applies to the points which we have touched on concerning agriculture which various other colleagues are also working on."
"We have made a great deal of effort with the new anti-fraud authority."
"Of course this has involved the application of a little friendly pressure, in particular on the part of the Council presidency and our own House, to make the Commission finally understand that it cannot simply deny facts which are on the table."
"Otherwise we will have to deal with these matters in another forum, and that would be before the European public."
"I do not wish to threaten anyone, but we have to state clearly what we as a Parliament expect of the Commission in terms of accountability, in particular if any of its Members also wish to be in the next Commission!"
"Mr President, the 1996 and 1997 discharge procedures changed the way the institutions work together in the field of budgetary control - before, we only had cooperation of this sort with the budget."
"I said in the debate on the 1996 discharge back in December that I was actually disappointed by our arrogance - as reflected in the Treaties - in not even allowing for the possibility of discharge being refused."
"Mrs Theato pointed this out, and the Rules Committee of this House has now rectified the situation at last."
"Now, of course, I should also like to invite the Council to continue its work, so that it too will finally meet the conditions."
"Our group has been consistent in its position; it is also thanks to the stubborn and tough stance deliberately adopted by our rapporteur, Mr Elles, that ultimately the whole House has gone along with this approach, and today we have a success for which we in principle have only one person to thank, the rapporteur, Mr Elles, with his report on the 1996 budget discharge."
"Discharge will not be granted for 1996, the accounts will be closed, and discharge can only be given for 1997 if - as you have just quite rightly said, Mr Bösch - the deficiencies are ironed out; the fact that they have not been has of course just been criticised by us both."
"A working paper and work programme have already been included in the Elles report; no one has yet reacted to them."
"There was a report from the Committee of Wise Men, and this in fact only confirmed what we had already established ourselves."
"Now we are in a state of uncertainty which will drag on until September if the Committee of Wise Men presents a second report, and I do not believe that anyone in this House is happy about being in limbo in this way."
"But to avoid overburdening the 1998 discharge procedure with these problems as well, the 1997 discharge procedure has to be brought to a conclusion."
"If it is not, we shall never be finished with this matter and I will probably be affected by this personally in the 1998 budgetary procedure."
"That is why I wish to invite the Commission - whoever wishes to take the responsibility for this - finally to take the measures which we have demanded."
"I am already worried, Mrs Cresson; your work with Leonardo concerned the 1998 financial year."
"At the time, we were accused of confusing 1996 and 1998."
"No, the problem is that this came to light in 1998, and I should like to ask you, Mr Liikanen, to tell your colleagues that at that time, in the summer, we sat upstairs on the seventh floor - things were really pleasant and friendly then - and made you an offer: be open, admit your mistakes, show us where the faults lie, and we will be prepared to compromise."
"That did not happen, and now you will have to find a way of dealing with the severity with which you are now being treated."
"But this is also significant for the 1997 and 1998 discharges."
"I now turn to the House itself."
"Since the very member of the Socialist Group who has been the most cooperative towards us is sitting here, I will actually avoid criticising the Socialist Group; otherwise I would have said that the dilemma facing us today is in fact the fault of the Socialist Group."
"Mr President, it has been a difficult task for the rapporteur, Mr Brinkhorst, and for the Committee on Budgetary Control to work on the 1997 discharge, because there has been no 'proper' Commission with which to discuss the discharge for 1997. Let me say that it is deplorable that the Member States did not appoint a new operational Commission long ago, because the acting Commission is in a state of paralysis and has chosen to be unwilling to take any kind of initiative to rectify errors or omissions."
"Obviously, in such a situation we cannot give a discharge."
"But even more important are the real political problems which remain unresolved."
"There has still been no reform of staff policy and still no improvement has been made in the administration of the various programmes."
"Especially in connection with the Central and Eastern European countries, with which I have worked a great deal, it is disastrous that people are incapable of turning the budgeted amounts into concrete projects, that the rules on open tendering and on concluding contracts are not being observed, and that no results can be shown in connection with the programme for the safety of nuclear power stations, to mention but a few specific examples."
"We need a better structure, a better administration and greater transparency."
"That is the crucial message to the Commission as a condition for even considering approving the accounts for 1997."
"Mr President, I have closely examined the report by the Committee of Wise Men which suggests that both the Members of the Commission and its officials lack a sense of accountability."
"A sense of accountability, according to the report, is a pre-condition of democracy."
"The report states how abuse was not investigated in the Commission, or, if it was, it was investigated too late and too long."
"Furthermore, the penalties were too lenient."
"The same is true of the conclusions on the matter now in hand, which was the basis for refusing discharge."
"The Commission resigned, but from the point of view of the Commission this resignation was very obviously an advantageous decision."
"I read in the 'European Voice' that on their resignation, the Commissioners would receive a three year severance package."
"If they had been dismissed such an arrangement would not have been made."
"Commissioner Van Miert had thus suggested that they should resign as one body, thus guaranteeing the implementation of the severance package."
"In my opinion, it is wrong and unfair that they should be rewarded so well for the work they have done so badly."
"Mr President, I realise that our rapporteur, Mr Wynn, was not here to present the reports on the discharge for 1996 and 1997."
"The reports were adopted in committee without any amendments."
"They were finalised in committee and can therefore also be put on the agenda for tomorrow's vote."
"I should like to mention this here for the sake of the procedure, because an opinion was delivered on the subject by Mrs Günther which likewise dealt with the development budget for 1996 and 1997."
"According to the procedure, we therefore ought to include this on the voting list for tomorrow."
"I should like to ask you to see to this, because as I have said, the rapporteur was not present."
"Thank you, Mrs Theato."
"Mr President, I am sorry I am late, but there are other meetings taking place at the same time and it simply is not possible to be in two places at once!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, throughout the debate about reforming the Commission, I have supported clear principles, and today these same principles once again form the basis of the amendments I have tabled to the Elles, Brinkhorst and Fabra Vallés reports."
"Firstly, responsibility must be seen to be accepted."
"That is why the accounts for the 1996 financial year cannot be closed straight away, for example while there has been no reimbursement in areas where nepotism has been established."
"Secondly, the greater the transparency, the less need there is for controls."
"As long as the Commission still does not respect Parliament's right to have access to information, the institutions cannot trust each other, and nor will they win the increased trust of the general public."
"That also applies to a Commission which has resigned."
"Thirdly, Parliament's criticism of the Commission will only be credible in the eyes of the general public if it adopts the same critical attitude towards itself."
"As long as documents in connection with proceedings against SEL are withheld from me and the Committee on Budgetary Control, discharge should not be granted for Parliament either."
"I hope I have made it clear that where discharge is concerned, my group is guided by its own principles, which indeed apply to both the Commission and Parliament."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to reply to Mr Elles' questions concerning the preparation of the different documents which were based on the programme which Mr Santer presented in January and which was referred to in many of the discharge reports."
"The preparatory work on the code was very far advanced by mid-March."
"The code of conduct for officials was ready in the Commission but it went to negotiations with the staff organisations."
"It is available from the Commission."
"Also, the first drafts of the code of conduct between the cabinets and services have been drawn up and, as far as the nominations are concerned, that was under way."
"At the same time, the Commission has taken a decision to freeze all nominations of A1 and A2 level until the new Commission is in place."
"A decision was taken to freeze all the nominations until the code of conduct was accepted."
"Secondly, as far as the Staff Regulations reform is concerned, there was the famous David Williamson report which was presented last autumn."
"The technical consensus-seeking negotiations with the staff organisation have started and also the first political consensus-seeking sessions have taken place."
"The position of the Commission was that the Williamson reform serves as a good basis except in one area."
"The Commission would like to have more open options for disciplinary procedures."
"There was a clear opinion that more independent disciplinary procedures should be envisaged."
"At the moment disciplinary procedures are always internal."
"They are based on joint opinions."
"There has also been a strong opinion that outside, independent, experienced people with experience in judicial procedures should be involved."
"That part has been most open."
"All this work has been done and now it is for the next Commission to take the political initiatives."
"It will help the new Commission that this preparatory work has been done and the new Commission can make a political choice on the codes of conduct."
"If the Committee on Budgetary Control in the meetings in June wants to hear about these preparations I will be available on a personal basis."
"It has been understood by the Commission that to take clear and strictly political decisions which tie the hands of the new Commission at a time when the Commission has resigned is a question which must be considered on a case-by-case basis."
"For the rest, the Commission takes note that the discharge procedure for 1996 is about to reach its conclusion on the institutional legal side which is being discussed here today."
"I refer to discussions which we had earlier here on the basis of the Fayot report."
"As to the discharge reports for 1997, the Commission takes note of the fact that the Committee on Budgetary Control has proposed postponement of the discharge on institutional grounds connected with the Commission's resignation."
"On the guidelines contained in the working document annexed to the motion for resolution, it will therefore be for the next Commission to take the appropriate initiatives."
"Mr Bösch put a question here but the Commission has replied to those issues."
"I am sure that Mr Brinkhorst can confirm that we have had a great number of discussions and meetings."
"We have also sent documents to the Committee on Budgetary Control even though it is difficult for the Commission to make a political commitment for the next Commission."
"That is excluded."
"However, if you want to clarify things, I am available as are other Commissioners as along as we are in office."
"Our responsibility is to work, but undertaking a commitment to changes of a political character is for the next Commission."
"I would also stress that the guidelines presented by the rapporteur are part of a major reform movement."
"The Commission has started reforms of SEM 2000, sound financial management."
"I disagree to an extent with Mr Giansily."
"There have been achievements as well as failures."
"It is very important to analyse what went well and what went badly in order to progress further with reforms."
"In the area of the structural funds the new regulations are clearer."
"The eligibilities for different funds have been agreed."
"The possibility to use financial correction is there."
"There have been issues where Parliament and Commission have agreed and there has been progress."
"But there has been a problem, I can admit that when we have taken decisions at political level which are clear and in the right direction, the ability of the Commission to implement the decisions in all its services in the same way has been weak."
"They have been implemented in some services but not in all."
"That is the issue the new Commission must pay a lot of attention to."
"It is important to take the right decisions but it is equally important to have a system to guarantee that all will be implemented to the very end."
"In the MAP 2000 area there have been improvements in decentralisation towards the separate DGs and cutting down the red tape so that all the officials could be directly responsible."
"Much remains to be done."
"And the design of the Commission for tomorrow is being prepared for the next Commission."
"It is very important that the new President has all the elements on the table when he takes his decisions on the portfolios and, in that context, on the structure of the services."
"I agree with three major conclusions of the rapporteur."
"One is that there must be an improved partnership/management of Community actions."
"It is very important that the Commission and Member States act together and that the rules and responsibilities are clear and are shared and that we know how to correct things if they go badly."
"We have already made an effort and I am sure we can continue."
"I was happy to note that the rapporteurs of the Committee on Budgetary Control were at the sessions with the Member States last time."
"Both sides found it very useful."
"Secondly, the issue of decentralisation and devolution of Commission action especially in the field of external programmes is extremely important but we need very strict rules for the delegation of the management of Community policies and that must always be actively pursued."
"In that context there has been an area where the problems were bigger than expected."
"For those who came into this House in 1995, I am referring to the area of the external offices which were performing many tasks for the Union."
"Thanks to cooperation with Parliament we have been able to agree now the budgetary framework so that there must always be budgetary commentary."
"As you know we have drafted a vademecum on the issues which can be given to external sources and on what rules must be respected."
"But it is very clear that this work must continue."
"That has also been discussed in the reports by Mr Elles, Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Bourlanges."
"The third area which is very important is the global reform of financial regulations."
"There also the first communication has been done."
"Mr Dell'Alba was the rapporteur."
"Discussion continues."
"We are waiting for the financial decision of the Court of Auditors."
"It is extremely important to try to put all these small reforms in one clear global financial regulation where the roles and responsibilities of each player in the implementation of the budget within the Commission, namely the authorising officer, the financial controller and the accounting officer, will be clearly defined."
"That is extremely important."
"Finally, it has been a painful year and obviously this will be the last time we have an open debate on the issue."
"It is extremely important that all of us who care about the future of the Union, care about the good execution of the Community budget, care about the value of the taxpayers' money try to utilise all this to achieve deeper reform which has clear objectives and a strong capacity of implementation which can lead to results."
"I say that only because I know that in the House there are also people who are very worried and rather disconcerted because of this public debate."
"It is not the fault of any of us but we must take that into account."
"We hope that the painful experience of this Commission can be used by the next Commission so that it will strengthen and not weaken the process for reform."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Mr Elles has a brief comment."
"Mr President, I would like to clarify one point in the Commissioner's response to this debate."
"I thank him for the information he gave us on a number of these codes of conduct."
"However, there is one report which I referred to in my speech which relates to paragraph 7 of the January resolution."
"In the absence of any Socialist member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I think I should do it on everyone's behalf."
"It says: 'Looks forward to the report of the President of the Commission preparing for the Cologne Summit of the internal reform of the Commission."
"We plan to hold a major debate in this May session'."
"Could I ask the Commissioner to provide this report when it is available to the new Parliament so that we will have all the information at our disposal."
"I know that a lot of work has been done, in these exceptional circumstances, by the services and the Cabinet of the President."
"I will talk to him about the issue."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"List of legislative proposals pending"
"The next item is the report (A4-0255/99) by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the implications of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam (list of legislative proposals pending as at 1 May 1999, indicating new legal bases and any changes in legislative procedure following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam) (C4-0134/99 - SEC(99)0581 - C4-0219/99)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I was just thinking that this is the last report I shall give as rapporteur in this parliamentary term."
"I was also thinking that few parliamentarians can have been lucky enough to cut their political teeth on the directive on voting rights for citizens of the Union resident in a Member State other than their own, and to draw their career to a close with this report on the implications of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam for legislative proposals pending. Indeed, the start of my parliamentary career was also the first time I appeared in an institutionalised political forum."
"That said, and with a certain nostalgia for the other reports I have presented and the many times I have spoken in the House over the years, I shall move on to the issue we are concerned with today. Commissioner, I must first say on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs that we have taken note of the document you have presented to us."
"I hope Parliament will confirm this tomorrow but we accept, share and understand its content, despite the pressures of time imposed by the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. It is an excellent working document and I naturally agree with the philosophy behind it, which is clear and which specifies the essential details."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament can go no further."
"It will be for the incoming Parliament to consider the validity of the legal bases in each case, pursuant to our Rules of Procedure."
"This report goes beyond merely listing the changes the Commission has noted and which it suggests other institutions consider, though these should be borne in mind. Procedural changes affecting more than a hundred acts are noted."
"Eighty of these involve transfers from the cooperation procedure to the codecision procedure in areas such as transport, the environment and social affairs."
"Changes in the legal bases are also recorded, notably concerning matters covered under the old Article 43 - agriculture - and which now come under the title covering public health."
"Finally, there are very significant changes concerning the policy, content, aim, inspiration and underlying political principles behind issues moving from the third to the first pillar in the area of justice and home affairs. The integration of the social protocol into the Treaty itself constitutes another important change."
"We must exercise our responsibility towards the people preserving the powers granted to Parliament under the Treaty, and we must guard these powers, just as we should when they are granted to other institutions. The new consultations relating to the Committee of the Regions or the Economic and Social Committee are good examples of this."
"In this connection, Parliament will not bow to any other institution's interpretation of procedural matters. Such matters must be considered - as the Commission's report rightly points out - on the basis that the act adopted will be adopted in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam, and that this is the procedure that must be followed."
"Moving on from here, we are bound by another important principle which is also related to the responsibility we have to the people and which I mentioned earlier. I am referring to the principle of preserving the acts, the principle of being as effective as possible and of providing the best and fastest response to the people."
"Therefore, whenever possible, we shall confirm and ratify procedural arrangements to ensure that each act is adopted and comes into effect at the earliest opportunity."
"Consequently, as a general principle, Mr President, we should be unyielding on general principles but as flexible as possible on specific applications."
"In conclusion, what we are confronted with is a change that summarises Parliament's philosophy very well indeed. As Commissioner Oreja is on record as saying, this is a change which from 1 May will equip the European Union with a more efficient instrument, one which is more open to dialogue with the people, more democratic and more outward-looking."
"I believe that this report responds to these ideas."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must congratulate Mrs Ana de Palacio."
"She herself referred to her first and last speeches, but I would like to emphasise that between them Mrs Palacio has applied herself to her work intelligently, competently and with great energy. All of us as individuals and all the institutions have most certainly benefited from her contribution over the last five years."
"Turning to the report before us today, the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam did of course mean that we had to resolve a number of procedural issues concerning legislative proceedings pending."
"Matters have not been helped by the fact that the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam coincided with the final part-session of this Parliament. Nevertheless, we are convinced that the loyal cooperation between the institutions will enable us to find a solution to any problems which may arise."
"As you are all aware, on 1 May the Commission forwarded to Parliament and the Council a communication detailing the consequences of the entry into force of the Treaty for all proposals already submitted and not yet adopted."
"Eighty proposals previously subject to the cooperation procedure will now have to be considered and adopted under the codecision procedure."
"For some 20 proposals, Parliament's involvement changes from a simple ruling to codecision. Further, the legal bases of 27 proposals have been modified."
"Parliament has already made its views on a number of these proposals clear, and the Commission has incorporated some or all of these into its amended proposals."
"We believe it is very important to ensure that the people of Europe do not feel that the Community's decision-making powers have been constrained as a result of the entry into force of the Treaty or because of the parliamentary elections."
"It is therefore essential to carry on with the legislative work as usual."
"Mrs Palacio's report suggests a procedure confirming the one that was chosen by the European Parliament after Maastricht. It involves Parliament's confirmation of the legislative procedures already under way whose legal bases or procedures have been amended pursuant to the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"It is worth mentioning that some cases call for swift action, particularly the three concerning approval of the conclusions of the negotiations on Agenda 2000."
"I certainly appreciate the goodwill Parliament has shown in dealing with all urgent pending matters - especially those relating to Agenda 2000 - at this part-session despite the pressures of time."
"Finally, I should like to refer to the proposals pending concerning justice and home affairs and affected by the fact that under the Treaty of Amsterdam such matters have now become a responsibility of the Community."
"In these cases, the Commission will formally table new proposals. The content of these will naturally be retained, but the most appropriate legal instrument will be used, be it a regulation or a directive."
"As for the two agreements on the forwarding of acts and the recognition of decisions in marital matters and parental responsibility, these will be forwarded to the Council and to Parliament immediately. They are due to be adopted by the Commission tomorrow in accordance with the Treaty."
"In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that in view of the institutional calendar and the political circumstances which have resulted in the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam coinciding with the advent of a new Parliament and a new Commission, it will be for the incoming members of both these institutions to pursue dialogue on this issue with the Council."
"Thank you very much and congratulations once again, Mrs Palacio."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Dispute between the EU and the USA"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on the WTO dispute settlement procedure for the dispute between the European Union and the United States."
"I should like to welcome the Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan."
"Commissioner Brittan, once again you have made the position very clear, and indeed you have also dealt with the various trade disputes in which we have been engaged with the United States for quite a number of months, if not for years in some cases."
"Several points give me cause for some concern."
"Without further ado, I should like to turn to the first of these."
"All these cases, these trade disputes, in which we are at present engaged with the United States or with Canada, are in principle test cases, in which the boundaries set by the World Trade Organisation are being scrutinised to see how much independence and autonomy countries actually have to determine their own policies in particular fields, whether it is consumer protection, whether it is health care, whether it is a question of how policies with respect to developing countries can be implemented - as in the banana case - or whether it is about standards."
"These are all key questions, and we have a World Trade Organisation which has marked out a framework within which we have to act as a trading partner."
"In principle and by and large we are happy, but we know that there are definite borderline situations and cases which are being tested out by means of complaints or rulings."
"This is the situation in which we find ourselves."
"My second concern is that there are two conflicting models here, and the hormones case illustrates this perfectly: the famous American model, if I may call it that, with a different system of health care, and the European model, in which welfare is given greater prominence."
"What bothers me is how we are going to be able to work together in the future and how in the new trade round we are going to be able on the one hand to agree on more common standards, while on the other hand guaranteeing a greater degree of independence and autonomy in the self-determination of regions and countries."
"That will not be very easy; indeed we have already discussed in the committee several times how this is to be achieved."
"This hormone case will be the test case for the European Union."
"This will far surpass everything we experienced in the banana dispute, because here consumers will of course be very sensitive, and they want policies which guarantee the highest possible standards of health care and health protection."
"At the moment, I am very unsure of how we can react in the light of the answer which you have given."
"On no account should we rule out any option, and on no account - this is my group's opinion and other colleagues will also be mentioning this - should we make any concessions at this stage."
"On no account should we make a political statement committing ourselves to anything before we have the final results of the scientific investigations."
"Only then should we reopen discussions - involving Parliament, the Council and the Commission - on what our next move ought to be."
"At the present time, I would consider a statement of any kind to be premature."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time of great agitation, whether the source of this is the Kosovo conflict or a different conflict altogether, we are again obliged to debate a subject in the European Parliament which has already occupied all of us for too long, the trade dispute with the USA."
"The United States is insisting on one point of view, firstly with bananas - an issue which has most likely been resolved in its favour - and now with hormones, where it is extremely difficult to draw the picture in such a way that it will attract the sympathy of those outside the European Union, because the trade disputes we are talking about here only involve 2 % of our joint trade."
"But it is precisely because of this that I should like, on this occasion, to make a clear appeal to the United States."
"Although we know about the need for innovation, what really matters to us Europeans is not neglecting our traditional roots."
"I am thinking here, for example, of banana growing in some Member States and protecting our consumers, to whom we are accountable as elected Members, and we need to further consolidate that level of protection."
"In doing so, we also take the liberty of setting different priorities from those of our American colleagues in Congress."
"However, I do think it is essential also to appeal to the Commission and the Council."
"Sir Leon, our experience of working with you over the last few years has been extremely positive, because during the transatlantic trade disputes you have worked very closely with the European Parliament."
"I should like to thank you very much for that, but you alone are not the Commission and the Council."
"I should therefore, on behalf of my group, also like to ask that any efforts to resolve the trade disputes by extending the procedure before the WTO, so as to delay the result, should be vigorously opposed."
"I must remind all of us of what we have done frequently in the past."
"The European Union and the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia each have one vote in the WTO, but hundreds of developing countries, who are waiting in the WTO and hoping that their interests will also be taken into consideration, must not be sidelined by ongoing disputes between the European Union and the USA, because there are other fundamental problems too."
"I also ask that we Europeans do not only think about playing for time in order to delay the process of rectifying the underlying injustices."
"As the general rapporteur of the European Parliament, I should also like to warn that behaviour of this kind - playing with WTO rules mainly for political motives - might weaken the standing of the WTO both in the eyes of the USA and in the eyes of our own voters."
"I should also like to call on the Socialist Group to support the PPE Group's line on this issue."
"We are all experiencing all kinds of political difficulties as a result of the banana ruling and the hormone case."
"Nevertheless, in spite of these difficulties, we should not lose sight of the essential features of the legal solution, which is actually a workable one."
"The WTO banana ruling requires us to produce a clear regime for our own producers and ACP producers, as far as providing adequate market access for all third countries is concerned."
"I would also plead for a solution to be found as quickly as possible, because the legitimate imposition of punitive tariffs by the USA has put other sectors of the economy under considerable pressure and jobs are at risk in Europe as a result."
"As regards assessing and authorising hormone-treated beef from the USA, I would ask you to bear in mind that the reason we set up a multilateral legal framework was precisely to protect weaker states."
"Thanks to the WTO and because we are not giving in to market power, we have a legal procedure for raising legitimate concerns."
"But if no hard scientific evidence can be produced, then obviously no import ban can be imposed."
"The first in a series of reports assessing the health risks of hormone-treated meat has, however, come out today."
"The first point to emerge from this is that it is not completely safe to consume this meat."
"But we should avoid having a transatlantic - or indeed a European - philosophical war about individual reports and should wait calmly for the final verdict of the scientific community."
"It is noticeable that comments made in the interim are based more on emotion than on the facts."
"Today we have tried to combine the various opinions held in the European Parliament in one joint motion, to allow Europe to speak with one voice on this important matter."
"I would therefore ask you to vote in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, the main point for my group is that we have concluded an agreement under the terms of the WTO and must abide by the legal rulings which have been given."
"I agree with what the Commissioner said about the consequences to be drawn."
"Far more problematic is the question of animal hormones."
"In the first place, I think it has to be absolutely certain that there is no threat to human health."
"The second point I would raise is that of consideration for animals."
"Can these hormones be fed to animals without doing them harm?"
"I think European views on this are very different from those in the United States, and this too is something we must raise in the forthcoming talks."
"The second question I would ask of the Commissioner is this: what happens if we permit US meat containing hormones, provided it is labelled?"
"Can we then legitimately forbid European producers to use animal hormones?"
"What will the upshot of that be?"
"Lastly, Parliament has made numerous pronouncements already on the whole question of policy regarding the quality of farm products."
"Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution last October which broadly sets out what a policy of quality for European farm products might comprise."
"I suggest that this be taken into consideration in future discussions."
"The first is the need to foster dialogue with the Americans, as well as with other regions of the world, because we need now, and will need in the future, to form new alliances. The second is the need for greater vigilance on the part of the European Union in the WTO negotiations, bearing in mind their growing importance."
"In my view, in the banana affair, which you dealt with so well, the European Union must pursue its action against unilateral legislation before the WTO."
"With regard to hormone-treated beef, there are fundamental issues at stake, such as food safety and the choice of agricultural model."
"The interim report and the concerns voiced in the Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue considerably consolidate our position on the matter and, as Erika Mann mentioned, it is important not to make any concessions at this stage."
"If there is any compensation, it must be of a temporary nature."
"And as regards labelling, any change in approach would, at present, seriously weaken our position."
"Above all, Commissioner, bearing in mind the problems posed by the old WTO agreements on these types of products, I should like to know if you would consider reopening the WTO file on two counts. First, we need a better definition of the precautionary principle with, in particular, a reversal of the need to furnish proof where doubts arise."
"Thank you Mr President."
"With all due respect, Sir Leon, we have to discuss this now, and when you say that there is no reason for consumers to panic because we have the ban, then I have to say that we are on the brink of lifting the ban and, as Mrs Mann said, this is undoubtedly about the different ways of life in America and Europe."
"However, it is also about the huge interests of hormone producers and users here in Europe, Mr Kittelmann, as is apparent from your speech and the softly-softly manner in which it was made."
"In fact, we now have exactly what you wanted: no emotion, but the scientific proof - and, as requested, this is qualitative not quantitative - that the use of hormones is harmful, that they pose a risk to health, that they are carcinogenic and that they cause puberty to begin prematurely in girls;"
"I am just translating what it says here."
"This is what we have repeatedly stated and pointed out in the past: the use of sex hormones disturbs the hormonal balance in children at this particularly sensitive time."
"Sir Leon, consumer protection must take priority here, and this is not a legal issue; the legal issue should take second place to consumer protection and preventing the public from harm."
"Neither, Mr Mulder, is it about not complying with WTO rules and negotiated agreements."
"We want very much to comply with them, but we need to have some input into them and we need to develop them further where dispute settlement is concerned, as well as in the social and environmental fields and in the fields of health and culture."
"Sir Leon, we have seen that when dubious substances of this kind are used, the floodgates are opened, including for illegal use."
"In fact we can see it now with the samples which the Commission has taken that banned hormones are being used in the USA, and that it is not true that the meat which comes here is hormone-free."
"That means that if we were to lift this hormone ban, we would have to authorise the use of hormones here, with all their adverse consequences."
"Side-effects might be acceptable where medicines are concerned, Sir Leon, but with food there should be no such side-effects, and here the burden of proof needs to be reversed so that those who wish to produce and use these substances have to prove that they are harmless."
"That is what we should say in the WTO negotiations, and we should raise the issue of our European way of life and ensure that we are able to keep it."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, in this trade war concerning bananas and hormones there is a sting in the tail which, as we all know, affects European businesses and economic sectors which have nothing to do with the sectors involved in the dispute."
"This is part of the American philosophy of taking the offensive, to which it would be a good idea to respond, using the same instruments of course, but we cannot continue to ignore the price being paid as a result by some economic sectors and I would also point out, Sir Leon, by some countries more than others."
"I have never been an ardent nationalist but there is no doubt that if we look at the statistics - and you must know them better than we do - we can see that Italy and some of Italy's economic sectors have been hardest hit by the punitive duties imposed as part of the American retaliation."
"For example, the battery and accumulator industry is incurring extremely heavy losses, amounting to millions and millions of dollars, as a result of the 100 % duty rates imposed under the terms of this war."
"The proposal we would therefore make, and I know that this is being studied by DG I, is to set up a compensation fund, to propose to the budget authority that in order to give you and our common trade policy some weapons with which to fight, it should put into the budget a fund, a reserve which could provide compensation for European businesses that are the innocent victims of this fair and necessary common trade policy."
"This is the suggestion which I should like the House to approve, but at the same time I would like to support the studies you are carrying out with a view to making a practical proposal, so that the new financial perspective and the new budget also contain a pm entry, a specific reference to this extra weapon for our common trade policy."
"Madam President, Commissioner - for the moment - I listened carefully to what you had to say."
"Your speech surprised me; no, actually it did not surprise me."
"But in fact it did surprise me, because there are only two explanations for it."
"Either you cannot read, or you had a preconceived opinion and wanted this opinion to be confirmed, and that is why you do not like the scientific reports."
"Let us consider where we stand today."
"You said that it was a legal and economic issue."
"Is it a legal issue?"
"The WTO Appellate Body has told us to prove that there is a health risk."
"Has it not been proven?"
"The danger is proven, so where does that leave us today?"
"Mrs Mann said that we were not actually sure how we should react, and Mr Kittelmann said that any action we took had to be legal and actually workable."
"Mr Kittelmann, I look forward with great interest to seeing how you explain to your voters at the elections to the parliament in Berlin what is legal and actually workable."
"It was 20 years ago, Sir Leon, when colleagues of yours did this in your country, the United Kingdom, and look where that got us with BSE."
"You are well on the way to continuing that process with the government of the United Kingdom, should you believe that you have their support."
"Let us just consider where we are."
"We have six hormones."
"The scientific reports say that all of them pose a risk to health and that one of them both causes cancer and aggravates it, and you dare to say in all seriousness, Sir Leon, that now there should be greater transparency."
"Is that what you have in your Directorate-General and in your private office?"
"I would love to know."
"There should be greater transparency, we need new analyses: which ones then?"
"Ones which support and match what you actually want?"
"And you say that we need new scientific data."
"Which data would that be, Sir Leon?"
"I know that really you were in favour of the labelling option."
"Anyone who can read, see and hear knows that."
"But you also know what the labelling option means."
"A piece of meat can perhaps be labelled, but nothing which derives from it can be, not minced meat and nothing, nothing, nothing more!"
"You, the Commission, repeatedly told us this, did you not, when we were in favour of comprehensive labelling and wanted that in Parliament."
"Anyone who is in favour of labelling now is saying loud and clear: we actually accept health risks, we do not take any notice of them, and we accept that people will be at risk, including children who have not reached puberty - Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf made that point."
"Mr Kittelmann, go out onto the streets in Berlin and say: 'but it does say on the label that it is highly dangerous for children during puberty and for everyone else as well; and if people already have cancer it encourages more tumours to form, and in addition it can be carcinogenic'."
"Go on, why not?"
"I could not hope for more in the election campaign!"
"Now just tell me one thing, Sir Leon. You will not be in office for much longer, and that is why I do not actually need to hold too intensive a discussion with you."
"Whom are you actually representing here?"
"Are you representing the USA, or are you representing the European Union?"
"If so, whom in the European Union?"
"Certainly not consumers, because if so you would be aware that one of the basic principles of European Union legislation is that only safe, completely harmless products are allowed onto the market, and even then they are labelled."
"You see, a label is not a warning notice, Sir Leon; a label provides consumers with information, but the assumption is that the products are safe."
"That is not the case here, and what you are doing at the moment is what I would normally describe as reckless, but it is irresponsible, and I will make it clear in public what the Christian Democrats here in this House stand for!"
"Madam President, I shall concentrate on the crisis triggered by the banana sector, particularly because it seems logical for this sector to be the one most affected by the crisis."
"What does not seem as logical is that yet again the textile sector - among many others - is suffering the consequences of a crisis that has nothing to do with it. Indeed, following the decision by the WTO arbitration body, export tariffs for this sector will be increased by 100 %."
"Cotton bed linen and cashmere goods are particularly badly hit, as are other sectors, specifically those on the list that accompanies the World Trade Organisations's ruling. For the companies involved, the consequences will be very serious indeed."
"As you are aware, Commissioner, the textile sector is going through a particularly difficult time as it is being forced to compete with massive imports of cheap goods from Turkey and Asia. As a result, its plight is causing great concern."
"Furthermore, not all the Member States of the European Union are affected by the measures mentioned. This constitutes a serious distortion of the rules of competition within the single market and it will lead to even further negative consequences for those companies affected by the high tariffs the United States is imposing in its sanctions."
"Consequently, for these sectors which are now the victims of the banana war, it is essential to settle the dispute as soon as possible."
"I have therefore been very encouraged by what you said, and by the details of the initiatives and actions you mentioned that are aimed at finding a solution at the earliest opportunity. In addition, I am in favour of setting up a compensation fund to assist companies affected by the sanctions."
"Without assistance, many of these companies will soon be in a critical situation and could even fold. The resulting job losses would be particularly unfortunate at a time when the Union is trying to promote policies designed to increase employment opportunities."
"Madam President, there is a high level of awareness among consumers."
"This means that we cannot simply decide anything we like."
"It also means that consumers expect food to be of decent quality, but above all, consumers expect and demand that food should not be damaging to health."
"The situation may not be all that good here, but it is still better than in many other places."
"What we are seeing today is a dispute between two continents."
"As has already been said, this dispute concerns, amongst other things, meat treated with hormones, and in this case it is quite clear, as has been emphasised here, that we should put consumer interests first. Labelling is not an option at all, because it is not the job of consumers to act as guinea pigs for industry's new ideas."
"You must not gamble with people's health. I therefore also regret the fact that labelling is one of the options the Commission has mentioned in its statement."
"The problem is that it is very difficult to turn the WTO into the champion of consumer interests."
"But it is also true that faith in free trade has proved to be misguided."
"There is no reason to expect free trade to solve every problem."
"Free trade cannot be the driving force for the environment and consumer interests, quite simply because the two areas require a political consideration which the market cannot give."
"We therefore need to get some more politics into the WTO."
"And the EU will be among those insisting on the right to defend public health against the free market."
"In the long term we will also have to require the Commission, when negotiating these WTO agreements, to put consumer interests and environmental considerations before concern for the sacred free market."
"You need to understand that in the Commission. It is not good enough to consider only the free market, because then consumers lose out, as we have seen in this case."
"Things cannot be left to the market alone."
"Before I give the floor to Sir Leon, Mr Kittelmann has asked to speak on a point of order or to make a personal statement."
"Madam President, on a point of order, I should like it to be noted that what I actually said, word for word, which provoked Mrs Roth-Behrendt's attack was: 'we should avoid having a transatlantic - or indeed a European - philosophical war about individual reports and should wait calmly for the final verdict of the scientific community before we act.'"
"Your speech was emotional, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, above all the personal attacks on Sir Leon Brittan, which were melodramatic and unjustified; they were beneath you, and more in keeping with an election campaign which you wished to fight in Berlin."
"That was indeed not a point of order, but a personal statement."
"Madam President, if Mr Kittelmann is finding it difficult to understand his own statements and remarks, perhaps I should make my speech again."
"Otherwise, I fear he will not know my point of view."
"Ladies and gentlemen, at this late hour, there are bound to be some problems of comprehension."
"I am sure Sir Leon will now put us in the picture in his usual masterly way."
"Madam President, I will do my best."
"Let me begin with the banana issue, which is of great importance to a number of people."
"I listened with great interest to what was said, for example by Mr Dell'Alba and Mrs Ferrer."
"We are trying to resolve the question by coming up, after consultation with all the people who have a legitimate interest in it, with proposals, which we hope will be acceptable to all, to deal with the problem by amending our regime."
"If that happens, by definition the sanctions will end and that is the quickest way of getting them to end."
"But people cannot be forced to reach agreement and, therefore, we have to envisage the possibility of not reaching a comprehensive agreement."
"We then have to do our best, after having heard what everybody has to say, to make changes which meet the rules and satisfy as many people as possible, if not everybody."
"That of course we can do."
"But in those circumstances we will be able to say to the United States that the sanctions are not justified."
"The only way of compelling the United States to remove the sanctions is through the WTO and, therefore, I can assure Mr Herzog that we will continue with the 301 case in the WTO as well."
"As for the question of compensation, there are considerable difficulties as to whether it is possible to give it and there are certain disadvantages which, if mentioned, would only give aid and succour to our opponents on this issue."
"I would not wish to do that publicly but I can well understand the deep concern."
"This morning in Brussels, before coming here, I held a meeting with representatives of the European textile industry and I understand exactly how serious the situation is for them and for other people who are at the receiving end."
"Therefore, we will continue very hard and are committed to putting four proposals to the Council by the end of the month, with agreement or in the absence of agreement from our trading partners."
"Let me now turn to hormones."
"I must admit that I thought Mrs Roth-Behrendt got the wrong end of the stick in her comments as far as I was concerned, as well as what she said about Mr Kittelmann, which was without justification."
"As far as I am concerned, there is no question at all, as her tone if not her words suggested, of ignoring the interests of the consumer or wishing to put people's health at risk."
"I fear that her interpretation to the contrary bore a whiff of the electoral campaign rather than the exercise of pure reason, because the point I made was a very simple one: as long as the ban exists, there can be no risk to health because meat with hormones is not allowed into the European Union."
"As nobody at the moment has a proposal to lift the ban - you certainly did not hear any such proposal from me. There is absolutely nothing more which anybody can do to protect European health than to stop something coming in."
"You cannot do more than that; you cannot have a double ban."
"So what are now faced with is how best to handle the situation we have as a result of these reports."
"At this point I should like to comment on some of the broader questions which Mrs Mann and Mr Kittelmann raised."
"We have to ask ourselves: is there a fundamental conflict, as Mr Iversen seemed to suggest, between trade and consumer protection?"
"The answer is no!"
"It is absolutely clear that the WTO rules permit you to ban dangerous products."
"They do not permit you to ban products because you say they are dangerous, you must have a reason."
"It goes further than that: you do not have to be able to prove that the products are dangerous, you must have respectable evidence, even if it does not necessarily represent the majority or dominant view of the scientific community."
"When the WTO looked at our hormone ban - which of course existed long before the WTO came into existence - it came to the conclusion that the process by which we had arrived at that ban was not a risk assessment which met the standards that could reasonably be asked for before a ban was put in place."
"It is exactly for that reason that we have begun a new risk assessment, and we have the interim results of it, which, as I understand it, are partly derived from the re-examination of published literature on the basis of the criteria set out by the appellate body and partly derived from the interim conclusions of some of the seventeen new studies we have commissioned."
"It is an interim report: the final report comes at the end of the year."
"The question we have to ask ourselves is: how do we handle this situation as far as the WTO is concerned?"
"It is no use saying that we have our report and that proves it, because it does not remove the threat of sanctions."
"You have heard the people from the countries affected by the banana sanctions."
"I can tell you that the possibility of sanctions from the United States on this is much more serious, and therefore it is acting very much in the interests of European consumers, European individuals and European employment to say that it is sensible that these findings should be put into the public domain as fully as possible."
"It has not happened yet."
"I hope it will happen more fully very soon."
"There should be serious discussion amongst scientists on both sides of the Atlantic, because I do not believe that the United States is careless about the health of its citizens: it is as yet unpersuaded that there is a risk and, if we have evidence, it is right to put it to the United States as well as to everybody else."
"The question then is: at what point do we do this and how do we handle it?"
"That is something which bears further consideration."
"There is no fundamental conflict between consumer protection and trade."
"The WTO as it stands allows for that balance in a proper way."
"I am not saying that it is perfect - I would not say that to Mrs Mann and Mr Kittelmann at all."
"We have to consider exactly in the coming trade round how to improve the rules and make them clearer."
"I agree with Mr Herzog that one of the things we have to do is to produce a better definition of what the precautionary principle really means."
"I hope that it is possible for Parliament then to consider these issues on the basis of what has happened, knowing that there is no question of any precipitate action which could conceivably endanger the health of the European citizen."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received eight motions for resolutions to wind up this debate."
"The vote on these will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Reduction of VAT on labour-intensive services"
"The next item is the report (A4-0207/99) by Mrs Thyssen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC as regards the possibility of applying on an experimental basis a reduced VAT rate on labour-intensive services (COM(99)0062 - C4-0169/99-99/0056(CNS))."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the report which it is my privilege to present this evening concerns the Commission proposal to amend the sixth VAT directive in order to allow Member States, by way of an experiment, to apply a reduced rate of VAT to labour-intensive services."
"The proposal has a long history."
"As long ago as 1991, we and Parliament first asked for labour-intensive services, or at least some of them, to be included in Annex H to this directive."
"Regrettably, the Commission never shared our enthusiasm."
"It took us quite a few hours of negotiations to persuade the Commission to have a study conducted on the impact on jobs which a measure of this kind might produce."
"In the end, we had to wait for an edict from the European Council in Vienna before the Commission came up with a concrete proposal."
"The question now is what Parliament thinks of the proposal currently before us."
"Well, Commissioner, we endorse your proposal."
"Some professional bodies admittedly regret the fact that this is just an experiment of limited duration and not a definitive measure."
"We understand their disappointment, but we say that half a loaf is better than no bread, and if we cannot convince people with arguments then we will do it with figures, which this experiment will undoubtedly supply."
"Precisely because this was an experiment, the majority of the Economic Affairs Committee was happy to accept the general criteria and the fact that the scope of the experiment would not be limited to closely defined sectors."
"Naturally, we are all happy to say where our priorities lie, especially in the run-up to the elections."
"We can focus on the environment, services to families, parts of sectors we include within the social economy, and so on. All these things are laudable initiatives, but it is better not to make any choices here for the moment."
"That way, the Member States can tailor their experiments to those sectors where they expect to reap the most benefit. The broader the scope of the experiment, the more results it will yield and the greater the chances of sound final measures which will create more jobs on a sustainable basis."
"We have adopted seven amendments in the Economic Affairs Committee, Commissioner."
"We are sure that they clarify and improve the proposal."
"There are no great questions of principle, except in one respect, that of the authorisation procedure."
"Neither the Social Affairs Committee nor the Economic Affairs Committee can see why the Commission should not authorise Member States to launch an experiment."
"The Commission is after all the executive."
"Perhaps the Council wants to keep hold of the reins itself, and it still has the final say on fiscal matters."
"So we conceded that, but it is too much for us to accept that the Council can only grant authorisation on the basis of unanimity."
"That makes the procedure unnecessarily cumbersome."
"It will inhibit the ease with which the measure can be implemented. It may lead to use of the veto and obstructionist tactics."
"We find that unacceptable, hence our Amendment No 4."
"If the Council wishes to act itself, then very well, but let it be by a qualified majority."
"There are no legal arguments why this should not be acceptable."
"I should be glad to hear what you think about this, Commissioner, and what the timescale for it might be in the Council."
"Lastly, I should like to take the opportunity of this, my last report of the current parliamentary term, to thank you for the willing cooperation we have always received from you."
"Madam President, I do not think I have ever spoken in Parliament as late as this. I am happy to say it is the very last time!"
"It takes the shine off things a little to have to deal with a proposal which I have always strongly advocated in these kinds of circumstances, and in a 'like it or lump it' situation."
"We are so glad to have it at last that one is wary of being overcritical of it."
"But some criticisms do need to be voiced, not least about the length of time it took to get this proposal."
"In fact, one might best describe the speed of the process as that of a snail hitting the brakes just before a bend in the road."
"The approach of both the Commission and the Council was one of extreme caution."
"I think this was mainly so in the Council, where there seemed to be an exaggerated fear of competition but also that the measure might succeed."
"It happened to me several times in discussions, especially with German representatives, that they said: 'Imagine, if this works in the Netherlands, we shall of course be forced by social pressure at home to implement it there as well."
"Just think what may happen."
"If it is successful in creating jobs, it may cause a problem in Germany.'"
"I never understood that, and I do not feel at all guilty about it."
"What irritates me most is that it was precisely those Member States which are always harping on about subsidiarity which placed most difficulties in the way of other Member States which said 'look here, it is not the only way, but it is one we want to try in order to create more jobs'."
"When I put forward the proposal for a 'social' rate of VAT, as part of preparations for the Luxembourg summit - and I was not the first to do so, because an option had already been put to Members of the House previously - I believed that I was acting in the spirit of the Delors White Paper, which had already pointed out that we in Europe had saddled ourselves with a system which made labour extremely expensive, very expensive in connection with our profligate use of energy, raw materials and the totally free movement of capital."
"To my mind, that is still the central theme and problem in the Union."
"And I would say, as we address this subject, that Member States have still not done anywhere near enough here."
"'Social' VAT is certainly not the complete answer."
"It is just a small part of the answer."
"But it may offer a solution in the area of services at local and regional level."
"The Commission once produced an interesting 'employment rate report' in which it compared the rate of employment in the Union with that of the USA. One of the surprising conclusions was that we did not really lag behind the USA in any area except one, and that was services, services from the lowest to the highest level."
"I believe that a reduction in VAT precisely in the service sector at local and regional level could be beneficial, and at any rate increase the employment rate."
"Supply and demand can be matched here."
"Care of the elderly, jobs for the handicapped, environmental projects and so on - I do not want to impose my choices here any more than Mrs Thyssen, and I leave it to Member States to choose the opportunities offered by the proposal to see what suits their needs and capabilities best."
"Like Mrs Thyssen, I too have a few comments on the amendments we have tabled."
"Like her, I find it totally unacceptable that the Council should have to decide by unanimity on specific authorisation to a Member State to apply this reduced rate of VAT."
"It means that those Member States which have been obstructive right from the start will be given the ultimate means of being obstructive all over again."
"I think the Commission has to be consistent here and say that a qualified majority is the only logical legal principle to be applied in approving the system."
"I am keen to hear the Commissioner's response."
"Lastly, I was surprised and disappointed to see that the Commission has not kept the machinery for evaluation under its own control, but is in fact transferring this to the Member States and with it the initiative for new proposals."
"I think - and I appreciate the difficult position it is in at the moment - that the Commission is not really functioning properly here vis-à-vis recalcitrant Member States, but it will have to be very careful for the future."
"If the Commission surrenders the initiative for making new proposals, as it is doing in this proposal, it really is destroying its whole raison d'être , destroying a guiding principle in the Union, namely the right of initiative."
"That right rests not with the Council but with the Commission, and that is how it should remain."
"Madam President, things on the employment front in the European Union are looking a little better."
"The rate of unemployment recently dipped below 10 %, but naturally we are not dancing in the streets because it is still far too high."
"Parliament had to put pressure on the Council and the Commission for a long time to get where we are today."
"But I am glad that we are now able to debate a specific proposal here in the House."
"We have not yet, however, got as far as approving the proposal."
"As Mr van Velzen and Mrs Thyssen said, there is a major obstacle."
"That is the rule that Member State proposals to apply a reduced rate of VAT are required to have the unanimous assent of the Council, even though VAT is no longer the basis for Member States' contributions to the European Union, so the argument always put forward previously that that basis would be weakened is no longer valid."
"That makes no sense these days."
"I can imagine that one might ask a neighbouring country: 'Is it a problem for you if my shoe repairer is subject to a reduced rate of VAT?'"
"But why should Finland be able to stop shoe repairers in the Netherlands from being granted a reduced rate of VAT?"
"I really cannot see any sense in that."
"I cannot imagine anyone taking his shoes from the Netherlands to Finland to be mended."
"So I really think this is a reversal of everything which Parliament has worked to secure."
"I think we shall soon see all the Member States opposing every specific proposal, and I find that very disappointing."
"Some Member States have already put forward little lists of demands, the Netherlands amongst them."
"Can the Commissioner say to what extent there is agreement on some of the specific proposals in these lists?"
"For example, the renovation of buildings and shops and certain urban areas is being mentioned."
"I think a reduced rate of VAT might prevent whole urban areas from falling into decay."
"Renovation is not mentioned on the Dutch list."
"Is there any consistency in all these proposals, or is it just up to each Member State to say what it wants?"
"I wholeheartedly endorse the rapporteur's approach."
"Take for example her ideas on evaluating the experiments."
"The rapporteur wants the specific results of the scheme to be evaluated, including prices, for instance."
"What we do not want, of course, is to see a reduced rate of VAT bringing not greater demand and more jobs, but simply higher profit margins."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for the excellent cooperation we have enjoyed in recent years."
"I hope he will show a little flexibility over the amendments this evening."
"Some of them are very important."
"He will have another chance to make his point in the Commission on the subject of the Member States."
"That would be a fine way of rounding off the last five years."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I welcome this Commission proposal."
"Various speakers have already pointed this evening to the number of times we have pressed here in the House for VAT on labour-intensive services to be reduced."
"We realise it is not the instrument of choice for creating jobs. But reducing the rate of VAT will make these services less expensive and enable them to be taken out of the black economy."
"Whilst the Commission is not convinced that the measure will or may create jobs, research carried out by the Netherlands Economic and Social Institute for SMEs found that it could possibly create 66 000 jobs."
"That is no mean number!"
"I hope the experiment being launched here will prove helpful in creating jobs."
"We must not be afraid of negative repercussions on the budget, because look at what a lowering of VAT did for the ornamental plant growers: in my country, sales rose, earning an extra 340 million for the Treasury."
"But if we are to create jobs, the Member States must above all take structural measures; we have to reduce labour costs, make employment more flexible and encourage part-time working, and in these respects we see that there is still a long way to go."
"Madam President, it is good to see the Council, after what has been a protracted debate, now allowing the experimental application of a reduced rate of VAT to labour-intensive locally based services."
"In the Netherlands, for example, the number of shoe repairers was decimated between 1992 and 1998 as a result of the high rate of VAT on their work."
"Because it was so expensive to mend shoes, consumers tended to throw them away and buy new ones."
"The extra burden associated with this on the environment may perhaps be reduced if the VAT directive is amended."
"The number of jobs in this sector may also increase again."
"I am grateful to the rapporteur for spelling out these effects in Amendments Nos 1 and 2."
"It is also a good thing to reduce incentives to the 'black economy'."
"In evaluating this experiment, due consideration must be given to these aspects."
"I support the amendments which have been tabled, and I hope that the Council and the Commission will do so too."
"Madam President, first and foremost I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Thyssen, and express my own words of appreciation for the cooperation we have enjoyed over the years."
"In making this proposal, the Commission is responding to a request made by the European Council in Vienna in December 1998."
"It is certainly true that Parliament had for a long time been asking the Commission to move in this direction."
"But the Commission did not just get down to work in February 1999: we should recall that back in September 1997 it drew up a communication for the European Employment Council in Luxembourg in which this idea was put forward."
"It is nonetheless true that Parliament, much earlier on, had been asking us to do this."
"Why didn't we do it before?"
"For a political reason of substance: we wanted to avoid short-cuts in tax policy subsidising employment."
"Mr van Velzen is right in saying that this idea of a reduced VAT rate may be one instrument but is not the main instrument."
"Various Members have pointed out that the best ways of using taxation to boost employment are the energy tax and tax coordination enabling capital taxation to be increased slightly and labour taxes to be reduced slightly."
"Why did the Commission take until September 1997 to come up with this idea of a reduced VAT rate, which Parliament had been requesting for so long?"
"Because only in September 1997 did we become convinced that quite good progress was being made in key areas."
"The package of measures against harmful fiscal competition was very close to completion, and was signed by the Member States in December 1997; discussions on the proposal on the taxation of energy products were well under way."
"At this point we were sure that this proposal for a reduced rate of VAT would be a useful extra factor and not a short-cut enabling Member States to dodge their prime obligation."
"That was just to explain to you why we acted rather later than you had hoped but nonetheless in line, I believe, with the overall requirement."
"I will not spend a long time describing the proposal; I am glad that as a whole it has been appreciated and supported."
"I can assure you that the Commission, following these reports and on the basis of available data, will make an overall assessment and if necessary submit appropriate follow-up proposals after the trial period."
"I note with satisfaction that the Thyssen report broadly supports the approach proposed by the Commission."
"In substance, the main amendments tabled aim to do the following: stress the directive's favourable effect on the employment of unskilled or semi-skilled workers, the environment and also the reduction of undeclared work; stipulate that the Council, acting by a qualified majority, may decide whether to authorise the application of a reduced rate; and require the Commission to draw up an overall evaluation report, accompanied if necessary by appropriate proposals."
"I can assure you that the Commission would for the most part endorse these objectives."
"However, it is my duty to draw your attention to the fact that authorisation to apply a reduced rate is a measure concerning harmonisation of legislation on value added tax, which is covered by Article 93 of the Amsterdam Treaty, the former Article 99."
"Under these circumstances I feel it is impossible to depart from the rule that the decision should be taken by the Council acting unanimously."
"Apart from that, it is obvious that the Commission hopes that the measure will have the positive effects mentioned."
"Finally, I should emphasise that if, as I assume, we all want this proposal to be adopted soon by the Council so as to keep to the timetable called for by Mrs Thyssen, involving entry into force on 1 January 2000, I am unable to accept the amendments proposed."
"Mrs Peijs encouraged me to be flexible."
"In this case in point, I take flexibility to mean achieving results as quickly as possible and therefore, paradoxically, I shall take her request to mean that I should not accept the amendments, which would just slow the procedure down."
"I should also like to inform you that, thanks to the German Presidency, today in the Council the working party examining this proposal met for the first time and I think there are grounds for reasonable optimism."
"Finally, Madam President, this proposal, which I hope will prove very good for jobs, will also help to dispel certain doubts about the tax coordination work done by the Commission and the European Union."
"Here we have a situation in which Brussels does not want to claim more powers but to restore powers to the Member States, letting them make the decisions; here we have a case in which coordination of taxation does not mean higher taxes but lower ones, and in which the primary aim is employment."
"I hope that the Member States will want to use this subsidiarity we are granting them, without hiding, as Mr van Velzen fears, behind an obstacle conveniently put in their way by the European Union in order not to be exposed to the full weight of decisions made under their own responsibility."
"Thank you for the support you have given us this evening."
"Madam President, I too would like to thank Parliament and the Members who have taken the floor this evening for the staunch support they are giving to our endeavours to coordinate taxation."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"The rapporteur wishes to speak, and I now give her the floor."
"Madam President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for answering our questions."
"I gather from your reply that you do not share our view and do not accept the amendment in which we are seeking to have the authorisation procedure dealt with by a majority in the Council, rather than by unanimity."
"But unfortunately I have to say that your legal arguments have not convinced me."
"I assume that there are political reasons involved here, but there are no legal reasons."
"This is an implementing measure, and not a general measure."
"Legislation must of course be approved unanimously by the Council, under the terms of the Treaty."
"But I am afraid that is not so when it comes to implementing specific measures."
"There is a great difference between the two things."
"If that is the opinion of your legal service, and that is what the Commission officials told our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, then we are not at all convinced, and it might be no bad thing to look at this again from the legal standpoint."
"Thank you, Mrs Thyssen."
"Before Commissioner Monti replies, I should like to give the floor to Mr van Velzen, so that Mr Monti can answer both speakers together."
"To begin with, I entirely share Mrs Thyssen's opinion that the legal basis for that argument is completely flawed."
"And then I have a specific question for the Commissioner."
"Can he be sure that those countries which have been difficult from the outset will not use their ability to block matters within the Council if unanimity is required in order to give permission to a particular Member State?"
"Madam President, I do indeed appreciate the point raised by Mrs Thyssen and Mr van Velzen."
"In our view, had we not provided for unanimity we would have had difficulties of principle much greater than those we will have anyway in getting this proposal through the Council."
"I would point out that, for example, even the derogations under Article 27, which are basically implementing measures rather than new legislation, require unanimity;"
"I would point out the major difficulties we are encountering with the VAT Committee, whose whole purpose is to deal with implementing provisions and yet the Member States are holding out against a rule being passed by a qualified majority."
"To some extent therefore I can of course share your hope, which is my hope as well, of political realism being applied to an issue which affects employment, a matter of considerable urgency."
"I had to make a sacrifice when deciding to follow the path we have taken."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next sitting will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"One last word on the Minutes, concerning the Kai Islands, the eastern part of the Moluccan archipelago, Ambon itself, Ujung Pandang on Sulawesi, where Christian minorities have little or no protection against armed gangs."
"The Moluccans urgently need help."
"The case I am bringing, which you my colleagues endorsed in the run-up to Luxembourg, concerns financial penalties and roll-call voting."
"My main point is that it is for Members, not the administration, to decide Parliament's priorities."
"If I win my case, then all the fines wrongfully collected will have to be refunded, and you wished my colleagues luck with that yesterday, Mr President, for which I am grateful."
"We take note of that and it will be checked."
"Mr President, under Item 19 of the Minutes on the discharge, it mentions that I had a report on the EDF but when you look at the speakers' list you will see that I did not speak."
"Trying to be in two places at the same time is not an easy job."
"As coordinator for the Socialist Group I was still in the Committee on Budgets discussing the interinstitutional agreement."
"Therefore, I would like to apologise to Parliament for not being here to present my report and also to thank Mrs Theato for moving it during the debate."
"Mr President, I have just got here only to find that my voting card is missing from the machine."
"I would point out that I am in the right place, as ever."
"I think you will be able to obtain a replacement card without delay, Mr Tindemans."
"In any event, we shall check whether there is anyone voting with a card in your name."
"Mr President, Item 18 of the Minutes - the debate on the European Fraud Investigation Office - is mentioned only very briefly; neither the Council president nor the Members who spoke are mentioned."
"This is really not normal practice."
"It only says that Members spoke, but it might be quite helpful if we knew who."
"Perhaps this can be added."
"We shall check that and put it right."
"Mr President, I also have a point to make concerning the Minutes."
"In Item 8 (Documents received), point (ab) mentions a draft decision by the European Parliament on the Members' Statute; it also gives a C-number."
"I would like to ask what this actually refers to."
"I do not remember this draft being presented yesterday."
"Does it refer to Parliament's decision in December or does it refer to this Council paper that has no legal value?"
"I would like an answer here."
"Applause"
"Mr Lehne, the services have explained that this is a technical error which only affects certain language versions."
"For instance, it does not appear in the English text. So no Council text exists."
"All we have is a draft document for negotiation drawn up prior to the entry into force of the Treaty. It is therefore obvious that no official Council text exists, and nothing has been sent anywhere at all."
"What we are due to discuss is Mr Rothley's report on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"The technical error will be corrected."
"Mr President, I would like to make a correction to the Minutes, as they have not been worded correctly."
"First of all, I did not talk about the missile which hit the bus yesterday."
"I did not know about that when I spoke."
"I was speaking about the missile which killed sixty people."
"The main point, however, is that I only talked about extending our condolences and sympathy to the relatives, in other words the humanitarian aspect."
"It says in the Minutes that I asked for an official complaint to be made to NATO."
"I asked no such thing. I would like that to be corrected."
"Of course errors have to be corrected, Mrs Kokkola."
"The text will be checked."
"It seems that bombing errors can even affect the Minutes."
"The Minutes were approved"
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"Mr Colino has the floor to give the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture, which is the committee responsible."
"Mr President, this issue was dealt with at the latest meeting of the Committee on Agriculture."
"It is indeed linked to Agenda 2000 but in our view the Council's request for urgent procedure is not justified, as the system is only due to come into force in the year 2000."
"There will therefore be plenty of time for the new Parliament to consider it."
"Thank you, Mr Colino."
"Does anyone wish to speak in favour of the Council's proposal?"
"Mr Mulder has the floor."
"Mr President, I would prefer us to deal with this proposal now, firstly because we shall be covering all the other proposals under Agenda 2000 this week, so we might as well deal with this one as well."
"Secondly, the proposal is neutral in budgetary terms - it has no financial implications."
"So I think we would be better to cover everything to do with Agenda 2000 this week, and I shall therefore be voting in favour of that."
"Thank you, Mr Mulder."
"As no one else wishes to speak, I put the request for urgent procedure to the vote."
"Parliament agreed to urgent procedure"
"Since urgent procedure has been approved, this item will be entered on the agenda for Friday, and the deadline for tabling amendments is tomorrow, Wednesday, at 10 a.m."
"Statement by Mr Prodi, nominee for President of the Commission"
"The next item is the statement by Mr Prodi, nominee for President of the Commission."
"I give the floor to Mr Prodi."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the appointment of a new European Commission has always been an act of great consequence in European politics."
"This time, however, the process is taking place under particularly unusual conditions."
"Firstly, following the resignation of the previous Commission, we need to remedy negative developments and irregularities and regain the confidence that has been lost."
"Secondly, we need to act quickly to put an end to the crisis and return to normality."
"Thirdly, for the first time since it entered into force a few days ago on 1 May, the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam are now applicable."
"The opportunities for deep-seated reform that are presented by this new beginning can only be exploited fully if the three institutions involved - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - work closely together on a basis of trust."
"The conditions for this are in place, as we will see today."
"The nomination procedure is underway and could be concluded before the summer break."
"The nomination of Romano Prodi at the extraordinary European Council in Berlin was the first step, and in doing so the Heads of State and Government showed the European Union's ability to act and its determination to resolve the crisis quickly and convincingly."
"They agreed on a figure who meets the requirements of this difficult office as almost no other could."
"Romano Prodi is a European of conviction, a proven and successful economic and political reformer, and an experienced politician in administrative matters. He also brings to the post the necessary close relationship with the people and, after hearing his speech, I would say that he is a candidate who combines vision, a sense of reality, pragmatism and a clear awareness of what is needed."
"He is also a candidate who should live up to the expectations of this House."
"If you, the Members of the European Parliament, follow the proposal of the Heads of State and Government and vote in favour of Mr Prodi's appointment in Thursday's vote, the next step will be for the governments to name, in agreement with the President-designate, the people they intend to nominate as members of the Commission."
"The resulting proposal for the whole College will then be presented to the newly-elected Parliament as soon as it assembles."
"It is important to the German Presidency that all Member States apply the very strictest standards when it comes to forming the new Commission."
"We want a reforming Commission, a Commission made up of Europeans of conviction and convincing Europeans; we want a Commission made up of men and women who are distinguished by their ability, experience, leadership skills and personal integrity."
"I am sure that we all hope the necessary hearings can be concluded in time for us to secure Parliament's approval in July and proceed with the formal appointment."
"All those involved - Parliament, Council and Commission - have a common interest in ensuring that the new Commission is formed and the appointments confirmed quickly."
"For this reason I firmly believe that, if we wish to do so, we can keep to the timetable that I have outlined."
"The people of Europe expect this of us."
"It was intended from the outset - and this was confirmed by the Heads of State and Government in Berlin - that the new provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam would be applied to the appointment procedure."
"The Treaty has now entered into force and this means above all that the future Commission President and the European Parliament have a greater role in the appointment of the Commission."
"The intention was to strengthen the overall position of the Commission President and to underline this by giving Parliament a separate vote on the appointment."
"The current situation underlines the importance of the reforms introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which make the whole procedure more transparent and legitimate."
"We should not lose sight of this aspect in applying the provisions."
"The formation of the new Commission gives us the opportunity now to tackle the problems which played a part in the crisis and ultimately the resignation of the current Commission."
"The first priority will be the internal reforms which the Commission must undertake and - there are already very specific documents on this - rapidly implement by itself."
"Romano Prodi presented some of his own ideas to the Heads of State and Government at their informal meeting in Brussels on 14 April, and this exchange of views is to be continued at the European Council in Cologne on 3 and 4 June."
"In this context the programme of reform presented by President Santer - ' The Commission of Tomorrow', including the components MAP 2000 and SEM 2000 - is of particular importance."
"These proposals aim to modernise administration and personnel policy, solve the problems in the area of the budget, financial control and fraud prevention, and also to reform financial management by means of more efficient financial control. All in all, we need to establish clear political priorities, to bring Commission structures into line with future tasks, and we need greater decentralisation, including in terms of the administration of appropriations."
"We also need to rationalise and improve the efficiency of the Commission's work, and I believe that this should include adopting codes of conduct for Commissioners and officials. The Council and the European Parliament must also help to remedy negative developments and irregularities."
"If we want a Commission that has strength, the ability to act and integrity, we must also provide it with the resources it needs to deal with its new tasks, for example in the area of enlargement or humanitarian missions."
"Applause"
"We must also think about the reforms we would need in order to amend the Treaties."
"The EC Treaty provides only for the possibility of a collective motion of censure against the Commission by the European Parliament."
"Our most recent experiences have shown us that the possibility of dismissing individual Commissioners - whether on the initiative of the Commission President, Parliament or the Council - should certainly now be examined in cooperation with the other institutions."
"Applause"
"National regulations could serve as a basis here."
"The events surrounding the resignation of the Commission have shown that a truly European public is beginning to develop."
"The people of Europe have a new-found need to know what is happening in Brussels and here in Strasbourg, and certainly to follow it more closely."
"The public is now paying greater attention to all things European, things which were hitherto regarded as being the preserve of experts on Europe."
"I consider this to be a positive development."
"In this context more questions are being asked about the democratic legitimacy and control of the European institutions."
"There are various reasons for this."
"The EU has gradually grown in importance and its spheres of activity have expanded; furthermore, many more decisions are being made which directly affect the public and their lives."
"These decisions increasingly involve majority voting, so that individual Member States can be bound against their will."
"However, some of the decision-making procedures are very complicated and difficult to understand."
"The institutional balance between Parliament, Council and Commission that is provided for in the Treaties has in practice shifted to some degree."
"So the question is how we can strengthen democratic control in practice, guarantee legitimacy and increase transparency."
"I have already mentioned the reforms that could and must be carried out in the Commission."
"As far as the European Parliament is concerned, its supervisory rights are increased by the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"It is granted important new rights and powers in the areas of legislation, CFSP financing and the appointment of the Commission."
"However, the European Parliament still needs to be strengthened further."
"Applause"
"The more capable of action the Union becomes, the stronger the democratic legitimacy of its actions and decisions must be."
"Applause"
"This means that whenever the Council passes legislation by a majority vote - and we want to make majority voting the rule - the European Parliament must have an equal say and equal weight in the decision-making."
"Applause"
"The European Union is currently facing some enormous challenges: the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, enlargement negotiations, the expansion of the euro zone, the WTO round of negotiations, improvement of common policy in the field of justice and home affairs, and in particular strengthening the Union's profile in foreign affairs."
"In order to cope with these tasks we need a strong Commission that is capable of action and has integrity; we must now work together to ensure that the conditions for this are in place."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I and the House have listened extremely carefully this morning to Mr Prodi's opening statement."
"I thank him very much for the thoughtful and intelligent approach he took to the opening of this debate."
"That we are here today looking at the ratification of a new President of the Commission, six months before it was due according to the timetable, is a reflection of the changing roles and expectations of the European Union."
"We have seen the EU dealing in areas and working on issues which now affect the lives of the citizens of the European Union in a very direct way: the launching of the euro, soon not to be just a tool for banks and institutions but also the coins and notes in the pockets of our citizens and, this week, the coming into being of the Amsterdam Treaty with its changing emphasis towards policies that affect people and in particular job creation."
"When you are talking about jobs and the money in people's pockets, you are talking about issues that very clearly affect the lives of every citizen of the European Union."
"It is no coincidence therefore that there has been a greater concentration on the systems of governance in the European Union."
"These systems were found wanting and they have failed in the last few weeks."
"We need to see demonstrable change."
"The next Commission must reflect a new approach to structure and responsibility, not for the sake of form."
"We are not just looking for a Commission that looks different or pays lip service to difference."
"We want a European Commission that is different and will deliver policies for people."
"We expect that Commission to be different, to reflect the real work to be done."
"If I may say so, we do not want a Commission with structures and portfolios that simply reflect a division of the spoils between twenty Commissioners for whom the President must find a role and must find a job in order to make them look as if they are all important."
"We want a serious attempt to create a dynamic approach to delivering policies for the people of the Union."
"After today, Mr Prodi, you and what you will do will be scrutinised as never before."
"What appointments you make to your office, the multinational nature or flavour or otherwise of your staff, the gender balance, all these will assume an importance quite disproportionate to their actual significance."
"Your ability to demonstrate that you have had a role that befits the President of the Commission in deciding who should be in your Commission and what their portfolios should be - all these things will give your presidency and your Commission its opening strengths and, indeed, could well give them its opening weaknesses."
"I was glad that today you concentrated very much on the broader approach to your political thinking and programme for the European Union."
"In your last intervention in this House - which we all recognised was a very preliminary one, indeed you said so yourself - you made a largely economic presentation."
"Today you have looked at a much broader scope of policies with which you will be seeking to deal."
"We have had a flavour of some of your ideas, for instance on foreign and security policy, on home and justice affairs."
"I very much welcome your thinking in these areas."
"Your emphasis on the competence of Commissioners and their ability and willingness to act as a team is very much to be welcomed."
"Your emphasis on structuring the portfolios on the basis of delivering policies and your undertaking on transparency and openness are also very welcome."
"Of course I do not need to say that we have had such commitments before but we take you at your word that you are serious about these."
"I have a criticism and I would appreciate your comments in your concluding statement."
"Your speech today talked very little of people."
"You mentioned employment but you did not talk much about the need for the fight against social exclusion, the struggle for a fair and just Europe for all our citizens, the need to support Member States in the eradication of poverty, in particular amongst the young and the old in our societies, the need for equal opportunities for men and women, for black and white citizens of the European Union."
"Mr Prodi, your humanity was clear in your speech."
"Your commitment to peace on this continent is to be commended."
"I would have liked to hear a bit more about your belief in a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-cultural Europe."
"I hope you can reassure us of this in your conclusion."
"By way of conclusion, for me, as a Londoner, this weekend the importance of support for a Europe of fairness and justice for all our citizens, the need for us to be committed to the fight against intolerance, racism and hatred, against those concepts, was brought very graphically and tragically to our minds."
"This European Union is about a vision for the future."
"The big issue for our continent, for our economy, is also about people."
"If you are able to combine these elements successfully with a new Commission structure and ethos, you will have our support."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Prodi, on behalf of our group I should like to reiterate what I said on 13 April."
"We strongly and unequivocally endorse your candidacy for President of the Commission."
"We are convinced that you possess the political and professional skills to overcome the deep crisis in which the Commission finds itself."
"And this crisis must prompt us to carry out historic reforms."
"You have to reform the Commission, its cabinets and its administration."
"The problems started ten years ago, so the report of the Wise Men tells us."
"So as the present Commission has said, a new European political and administrative culture is required."
"But political reforms are needed too, which have been very clearly set out in a number of reports and documents of this Parliament."
"For example, the Herman report on institutional reforms which can be carried out without amendment of the Treaty mentions reducing the number of portfolios and sharing them out rationally within the Commission, and striking the correct balance between the collective and individual responsibility of the Commission members. I should be glad to hear your comments on that in your reply."
"Our group is very much in favour of interinstitutional cooperation."
"In 1994 as group chairman, I took the initiative in favour of changing the modus vivendi between the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Mr Oreja gave us vigorous support on that."
"I think this modus vivendi needs to be revised and expanded once again."
"New agreements have been concluded, and the new arrangement should be adopted under optimum conditions and approved before the new Commission takes up its duties."
"In another report, by Elmar Brok, Parliament argues that members of the Commission should possess appropriate expertise and above all be independent."
"The Commission must remain the guardian of the Treaties and serve the common interest."
"Our group wants to see a politically balanced Commission, with men and women, which enjoys broad majority support in Parliament."
"After your ratification by Parliament, Mr Prodi, you will be able to demonstrate your political leadership in the appointment of the new Commissioners."
"We hope that your legitimate authority as President will be a factor in securing their approval."
"President Prodi, we are impressed by what you have said."
"You wish to give new momentum to the European Union."
"Political union is one of your major objectives, together with further democratisation, transparency and cooperation with Parliament."
"But I think that since we have the new Commission President here with us, we also need to talk about a number of fundamental avenues of policy which you will also have to confront and where you too will be required to shoulder your responsibilities."
"We cannot ignore the role and responsibility which the European Union should undertake in helping to end the European tragedy going on in Kosovo, where the most basic of values are being denied - basic values, human values with which we are so quick to identify."
"A logic of war is being created there, based on discrimination, on crimes against humanity, on the desire for vengeance, on intolerance."
"It is an important fact, Mr Prodi, that where Europe - as embodied in the European Union, in European countries and regions - is not present, where there is no solidarity within the European Union, war in Europe is still possible."
"So we need more Europe, and a European policy which produces tangible benefits throughout the European continent."
"We must make it clear to people in the Balkans that peace and reconstruction are only possible in the context of the European Union."
"The spirit of Community solidarity made it possible for Europe to have states based on the rule of law, dialogue, democratic institutions and recognition for minorities, and that spirit may also put an end to a conflict which has plagued the peoples of south-eastern Europe for decades."
"How can these peoples, so desperately hard hit by the war, regain hope and trust?"
"We must show vision and generosity to lay the foundation for reconstruction and development in the Balkans in the spirit of the Marshall Plan, which in 1947 gave our countries the strength to reorganise themselves and recover."
"The second major area in which you have to deliver is the Union's ability to pursue a true foreign and security policy."
"Naturally the Council has supreme responsibility here, and when I think back to Maastricht, Mr President-in-Office, it has shown supreme negligence."
"What has been achieved in the last seven years?"
"The Council will of course take an important decision in Cologne when it appoints Mr or Mrs CFSP."
"But the lessons we have to learn from current events go much further than that."
"There is an imbalance of power between the USA and Europe when it comes to the strategic decisions taken by NATO."
"But the recent NATO summit opened up a new prospect."
"The Amsterdam Treaty confirmed the longer-term objective of a European defence arrangement."
"Regrettably, it has to be said that we are still a long way from that reality."
"We do not have any common weapons manufacturing capability."
"We have no sharing of operational duties."
"We have no integrated fighting forces and command structure."
"In short, we do not have the military capability of the USA."
"Where is the European peace corps in the Kosovo conflict?"
"What is the Western European Union doing?"
"Where are our spy satellites to provide the requisite intelligence?"
"The answer to these questions is a resounding silence."
"There is a European vacuum. And nature, as we learned at school, abhors a vacuum."
"There is a third major policy direction which you will have to address, and you referred to it just now."
"The future construction of Europe: now that we have the euro, you want to give political union a chance."
"In this House there have been majority or consensus votes in favour of a constitution establishing clear relationships between the Union, the Member States and the rights of European citizens."
"I think the institutional dynamic also has to be revived, these clear lines have to be drawn, if an enlarged Union is to be workable."
"Will you revive the institutional dynamic, will you create that new chance?"
"Are you amenable to suggestions from Parliament and its Committee on Institutional Affairs for shaping a Community approach rather than a purely intergovernmental one, which has made its limitations obvious?"
"Parliament has suggested that the Commission, in consultation with the European Parliament and, for example, on the basis of opinions prepared by leading experts and in consultation with the national parliaments, might make it possible to revive this institutional dynamic."
"In your first address on 13 April and again now, you have argued for a Europe not just of markets and banks, but a Europe which includes its cultural and spiritual dimension."
"Hearing you just now listing the various programmes for employment, training, consumers and the environment, I think there is a wide range of areas being addressed."
"Mr Prodi, are you - I am sure you are - in favour of the European Union as a social market economy?"
"You also spoke of those people, to whom Mrs Green referred, who are being excluded."
"Equal opportunities for men and women, for black and white, for people of any colour on the basis of the human dignity of each individual - that is the distinguishing feature of the European Union, its human face."
"You are undoubtedly in favour of that, and you will undoubtedly seek with your new Commission to further that, just as you will undoubtedly bring about political union and give Europe the means, the capacity, to play a proper role in Europe and the world through its common foreign and defence policy."
"That will make you a great President of a great Commission, working together with a new Parliament which will undoubtedly be keen to work with you towards achieving those ends."
"Applause"
"I should like first of all to thank Mr Prodi for elaborating today at much greater length on a number of the priorities which he wishes to emphasise for the next Commission."
"The full definition of the Prodi project properly should await the new parliamentary mandate and the nomination of the new Commission."
"I wish however today to make some remarks on the policy side arising from what Mr Prodi has said."
"I take note of that fact that as he talked about Europe's profile in the world he referred to enlargement and mentioned that enlargement will move the epicentre of the European Union towards the east."
"I would like, on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group, to place a somewhat greater emphasis on the urgency of achieving as early as possible an enlargement towards the east."
"May I say to Mr Prodi that some weeks ago at a Liberal International Congress in Brussels we were addressed by the Hungarian Prime Minister, Mr Viktor Orban."
"He reminded us of the words of another politician from Eastern Europe, saying that since 1989 they have been told in Central and Eastern Europe that enlargement is always just five years away."
"We must draw a line under that and we must make sure that during the lifetime of the next Parliament and during the mandate of the Prodi Commission we actually bring about the reality of the first enlargement to the East."
"For my group that would be a serious and significant priority."
"To do that of course requires greater urgency in modernising the democracy of the Union."
"That greater urgency has been recognised in the Council suggestion that we should have an intergovernmental conference beginning next year, something which we subscribe to."
"I would like to say to Mr Prodi that we, in our group, believe that as part of his European vocation for a new millennium and for the new enlarged Europe - he should perhaps reflect on the desirability of introducing into the debate the concept of a constitution for Europe."
"The aim here is not to finalise a project which is always evolving, but to help clarify for citizens in a meaningful way the whole complex of the documents we have produced in treaty form, the kinds of priorities that we have for the Union and the limits - because some of course also worry about the excesses of the Union."
"I certainly would commend to you that you examine the question of bringing forward as part of your project a constitution for Europe in the new millennium."
"In respect of the formation of the Commission itself, I should say that you have my group's full support."
"As you leave this House to go to the various capitals and form the Commission, we have a number of priorities we would like to see in respect of balance."
"It has been mentioned before that we expect to see gender balance."
"I would also emphasise that we expect to see political balance, that is a balance of political philosophies and views and also a certain balance that reflects the role of the main political forces in this Parliament."
"This is important."
"You said here today that you intend to have more team work."
"That is essential."
"One of your chosen mechanisms to achieve enhanced coordination will be through the Commission Vice-Presidents.You have not said how many vice-presidents you anticipate."
"Perhaps you could be more specific or perhaps that is premature, but I would say this to you, the greater the number of vice-presidents, the greater the onus to ensure for the sake of balance that some would come from smaller States."
"I do not wish, Mr Prodi, to anticipate the hearings of Parliament but I do have a question: in the event that Parliament decided that one ro more of the nominee Commissioners was not acceptable, what would you propose to do, given the powers you have under the Treaty of Amsterdam?"
"We urge you, both in choice of your Commissioners and in such an eventuality, to use your fullest powers under that Treaty and to demonstrate that indeed you are your own man."
"In the time that remains to me I should like to turn to Mr Verheugen and to the Council."
"If I understood correctly, Mr Verheugen, you urged us to complete this procedure of nominating and putting in place the new Commission by the end of July."
"I respect politically why you say that but it shows scant regard and little understanding for the due process in this Parliament."
"I want to treat this with urgency but also with due gravity and it would turn this House into a rubber stamp and nothing more if we were rushed into it prematurely by the end of July."
"Worse than that, if we got it wrong in July, we might want a second bite of the cherry next January and act more vigorously then than need be."
"Let us get right rather than get it early."
"If there is a problem now with an interim Commission that has lost its moral and political authority to act, the problem arises, in my view, because of the failure of the Council to listen to Parliament and to appoint an effective interim Commission."
"That is not a failure of this House."
"It is a failure of the Council."
"Mr President, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam, Parliament is now able to exercise the great responsibility of voting to approve the appointment of the President of the Commission for the first time."
"In this vote, Members will vote as representatives of the people of Europe, free from any pressure from national governments. The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left will make its decision on the basis of the commitments made by the candidate regarding his general political outlook and a clear programme of reform for the Commission itself."
"The recent institutional crisis and the verdicts reached by Parliament itself or through the Group of Independent Experts must still be fresh in our minds."
"We need to move forward to a completely new stage characterised by transparency and efficiency in the work of the Commission and in its relations with Parliament. Collective responsibility must not override the Commissioners' individual responsibility."
"The incoming President's role in the appointment of the Commission is therefore crucial."
"Our group calls on him to play his part in the selection of Commissioners to the full so as to ensure substantial renewal of the College of Commissioners. We need men and women whose career has equipped them to cope with the major political challenges facing the Union and with reforming the Commission itself."
"As far as the broad outlines of the candidate's programme are concerned, we feel bound to express the anxieties raised within our group by some of the statements he made today and on 13 April."
"We are concerned about the emphasis he placed on competitiveness and the flexibility of labour to the detriment of policies fostering economic and social cohesion."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left urges the incoming President to set out and develop economic and social policies aimed at creating employment."
"We also urge him to combat social exclusion and poverty by promoting public services across the European Union."
"I realise that in the present climate it is quite unfashionable to speak up for public services, but we on the left feel it is essential to do so."
"In our view, this should be accompanied by a gradual reduction in working time without a reduction in salary. Action against social dumping and financial speculation is also needed."
"To sum up, monetarist ideology must not be allowed to dominate to the detriment of our citizens' social and political rights."
"In our view, other key features of a progressive policy are the integration of environmental protection into all Community policies and the review of the ceiling for own resources in the Agenda 2000 financial perspective. Preservation of the Union's internal solidarity through its Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund should also be part of such a policy."
"Finally, we also believe that the Commission must make a great effort to prepare an Intergovernmental Conference to achieve the institutional reforms required prior to enlargement."
"In this connection, the Commission and its President must, with Parliament's support, boost the Council's scant political will to define a common foreign and security policy for Europe which is not subservient to the United States. It must serve to guarantee human rights in the Balkans and the world over, and ensure that international law is adhered to."
"In the few seconds remaining, I feel obliged to express my amazement at the reference made to the definition of a constitution for Europe. I have been a member of the Committee on Institutional Affairs for eight years."
"A draft constitution for Europe was withdrawn during the previous term, before the elections."
"It was only a draft or an outline and was never made public. There were absolutely no further developments for the next five years."
"Throughout those five years the subject of a constitution for Europe was taboo. Yet now the spokespersons for the major groups are referring to the drafting of such a document as a key part of the Commission's work."
"Actions speak louder than words."
"I urge you all to take responsibility for your statements in the House today in favour of a constitution for Europe before European public opinion. The people need to be aware of their rights and responsibilities over and above the squabbling and the vested interests of the Member States."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-designate, we are delighted to welcome you for a second time to this House."
"However, you are only just at the beginning of a series of hurdles which must be overcome in the next eight months."
"You will have to demonstrate great stamina and skill to stay the course."
"Although the confirmation of your appointment tomorrow by the European Parliament is not in question, and will doubtless be approved by a very large majority, you will have to face a much more difficult test in September."
"This is when, in front of a largely new Parliament, you will have to present all your Commissioners and an action plan for which not just you personally but the new Commission collectively must take responsibility."
"The whole process will then begin again at the end of the year as, having completed the term of office of the outgoing Commission, you will again have to ask for the confidence of the European Council and the European Parliament for a five-year term."
"Of course, this term may be interrupted at any time by a motion of censure vote which is clearly now no longer just a theoretical concept."
"Suffice it to say that your task will not be particularly easy."
"To avoid tripping over the successive hurdles which you will have to overcome, you must bear in mind that your legitimacy as President of the Commission is delegated and will be exercised under the constant political scrutiny of the Council and Parliament, themselves directly and politically responsible to the people of Europe."
"From now on, the institutional balance between the Commission, Parliament and the Council is of prime importance and the function and role of each institution must be clearly specified."
"Your main task, Mr Prodi, will be to ensure that the Commission exercises all the powers conferred on it by the Treaties, but does not encroach on the decision-making powers of Parliament and the Council."
"In particular, you must resist the pressures which may come from the Council or Parliament to extend your field of action to areas not specifically indicated by the Treaties and which, as has recently been observed, you do not have the administrative or financial resources to tackle."
"You will be responsible for ensuring that the work of the College is restricted to the powers granted by the Treaties, which are already quite considerable."
"Together with the Court of Justice, the Commission is actually the guardian of the Treaties."
"However, this function would be better served if its definition were improved in respect of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, which are not currently sufficiently clear or definite."
"The same applies for the monopoly of initiative."
"This point will have to be clarified during the institutional reform which must take place before any further enlargement."
"The Commission's implementing powers, particularly in the area of competition and state aid, are considerable and must be exercised independently but also with absolute transparency."
"In terms of commercial or financial negotiations, it is essential that the European Union speaks with one voice. But this voice must be authorised."
"The aims of the negotiation must be clearly specified in the negotiating mandate given by the Council, with the agreement of Parliament, whose representatives must be kept well informed of the progress of these negotiations, as is the case with the members of the US Congress."
"If our partners realise that the European Union is expressing the will of the people of Europe, this can only serve to strengthen the EU's negotiating position."
"This has not always been the case in the past and the trade dispute on banana imports from ACP countries has left a bitter taste in our mouths."
"Mr President-designate, your success will be measured by your ability to ensure that the Commission reassumes the role assigned to it by the founders of the European Union. It should be an independent body whose task is to find the largest common denominator - and not the smallest - to ensure that European unification advances only in those areas where it is necessary and essential."
"In this respect, the institutional balance must be preserved: decision-making powers must remain with the Council and Parliament, which alone are politically responsible to the people."
"The UPE Group wishes you every success in this difficult task, Mr Prodi."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, the resignation of the outgoing Commission showed above all that a more democratic balance of power was needed between Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"Without a strong Commission, Parliament cannot hope for any major reform of the institutions, which has been put off for years."
"The Greens are confident, Mr Prodi, of receiving your pledge here that you will make every effort at the intergovernmental conference to ensure that Parliament evolves into a true parliament with full powers of legislative codecision which extend to agriculture and compulsory expenditure, and with full powers of scrutiny over the implementation of policy."
"We are poised at a historic crossroads."
"Either Parliament continues to grow and the building of Europe becomes a true democratic project, or it remains a collection of bureaucratic nuts and bolts with no legitimacy, and that would be fatal."
"It is not just a question of more power for Parliament; our peoples have to be involved more actively in this process and must know and feel themselves to be citizens of the Union."
"As you know, Mr Prodi, Parliament wants a convincing reform of the Commission."
"We need a transparent Commission, with ready public access to documents, and that requires swift implementation of Article 255 of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The individual responsibility of Commissioners remains a central factor in the relationship between the Commission and Parliament."
"The Amsterdam Treaty gives you the opportunity to intervene if there are problems with the work of individual Commissioners."
"We also expect you to put together the right Commission, so that through you we too can have an influence if there are problems with the performance of individual Commissioners."
"What you said about the need for the big countries to have a Commissioner from the majority as well as from the opposition is being misused in Germany, for example, in order to sideline the Green partner in the coalition."
"If the new Commission only includes representatives of the largest partner in the government and the largest opposition partner, there will be little political innovation in the Commission."
"We want you, Mr Prodi, to argue for political diversity in the new Commission."
"The Greens have listened carefully to your speech today, which sits well with the letter you sent us and which says more about sustainable development, the environment and consumer protection than your first speech did."
"We shall hold you to all of that."
"In April, you distanced yourself clearly from the American model and came out in favour of the European one, but you said very little about what that meant in practice."
"For us, it should emphatically mean that not everything is governed by the logic of the market."
"If you seek to liberalise services without securing a universal service, that may give rise to problems."
"In the past, investment aid has been provided for purposes of rationalisation."
"We believe that innovation should be the focus of future aid, for example for SMEs, with a view to preserving and creating jobs."
"Lastly, it is our fervent hope that, given the necessary weight, you will urgently work for an initiative on the Balkans and see that the timetable for enlargement is politically reassessed in the light of what is going on there at present."
"In this spirit and in the expectation that you will take our concerns on board, my group is planning to support your candidacy."
"Mr President-designate, listening to you just now made me think of the very high hopes resting on your appointment."
"This is taking place at a very special moment, namely the final part-session of the Parliament elected in 1994."
"This coincidence, which was not planned, is giving this debate and the subsequent vote a rather dramatic nature as, to a certain extent, it represents the political legacy of the first European Parliament that had the ability to apply enough pressure on the outgoing Commission to force it to resign."
"Our expectations of you are high, Mr Prodi, and they involve so many and such a variety of issues that you will no doubt find us very demanding, although your introductory speeches have already highlighted many of these points."
"As the recent crisis has revealed the problems within the Commission, your first task will be to put your house in order."
"This is the work of a leader. You will therefore undoubtedly have to improve the coordination of the Commissioners' responsibilities, redefine the tasks to be accomplished by eliminating some and developing others, and reform the management methods, the procedures for awarding contracts, the use of consultants and so on."
"This is a long way from high politics, which is not possible, however, without a good administration."
"There is no doubt that in the past the Commission has too easily forgotten this sound principle."
"In particular, Mr Prodi, in terms of practical politics, Parliament expects enough vision and inspiration from you to meet the challenges facing Europe."
"In saying this, I am not just thinking of the programmes planned for future years, such as the implementation of Agenda 2000 or the institutional reforms the Union needs in order to complete the Amsterdam Treaty, but also the problems which go beyond these elements."
"Now more than ever the Union needs to rediscover and reaffirm the meaning of its very existence and its true priorities."
"Employment is therefore not a run-of-the-mill requirement but a major priority which must take precedence over others."
"I am pleased that you yourself recently proposed that the central banks should depart from their customary financial practices and draw on their reserves to revive the economy at all costs."
"We must find a new balance between the social and political Europe and the economic and monetary Europe, and we must counterbalance liberalism to some degree."
"Similarly, in view of the war in Kosovo and the fragility of Europe revealed by this war, we firmly hope that the European Union can stop considering the future of our continent - including Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and the Mediterranean - in such a cautious manner to the extent that this approach becomes constrained and ultimately foolhardy."
"This combination of nationalism and violence will form the backdrop to your actions in the next five years."
"In view of these threats, we would ask you to reaffirm the fundamental values of Europe and to give the EU a clear foreign and security policy and firm social priorities."
"In short, we need inspiration born of justice and fairness."
"Mr President, the Europe of Nations Group cautions against appointing Mr Prodi as President of the Commission."
"We have no need of a new President at present."
"What we do need is a clear-out by strong personalities who do not have ambitions to continue when the clear-out has been completed."
"Firstly, we should remove the present Commission, because the Commissioners have been deemed to be collectively irresponsible."
"They themselves rejected individual accountability and asked to be held collectively to account."
"That is what the Committee of Experts did."
"Now they must step down, and Parliament should ensure that before they do so, they do not extend contracts with their friends or have certain people promoted or move employees from their own cabinets to the administration."
"Secondly, we should call the officials responsible to account."
"The Committee of Experts should name everyone who has helped to obstruct the uncovering of dubious deals."
"Those who have contributed to corruption and fraud must be subjected to disciplinary proceedings."
"Those who have covered things up must be suspended, because it has to be worse to cover up corruption than to provide information about corruption, as Mr van Buitenen did, with suspension and salary deductions as a result."
"We must then adopt a modern law on public administration and openness."
"All appointments should be made on the basis of applications and qualifications, not as political appointments."
"All employees should know that future promotion is a question of effort, not of friendships and contacts."
"The best person for the job should be promoted."
"Anyone who occupies a managerial position must be more capable than those beneath him."
"We cannot have a situation where the more capable are passed over for promotion and then lose motivation and console themselves with privileges."
"The Commission should be decentralised, so that the staff are given responsibility and authority to live up to."
"Let us put an end to the concentration of power in the hands of a few, without any possibility of them taking responsibility."
"Let us put an end to complicated procedures where a decision has to be endorsed twenty times and it is impossible afterwards to say who is really responsible."
"There should also be a reform for officials, including fixed-term contracts and the introduction of ordinary northern European civil service salaries for new recruits."
"Privileges can be phased out."
"The first step could be to remove the automatic cost of living adjustment."
"It will not be popular, but who is going to defend the fact that the first consequence of moving a task to Brussels is that those who are going to carry it out will receive a trebled salary, diplomatic status with freedom from prosecution, access to business lunches and duty-free spirits?"
"The salaries of Commissioners should also be reduced before appointments are made."
"A Commissioner should be paid the same as a minister in the country he represents, and should pay tax so that at least in that respect he loses his status as an expatriate eurocrat."
"Removal costs should be reimbursed on the basis of invoices, not in the form of two months' extra salary."
"It should be possible for Parliament to inspect the travel and entertainment budget."
"The three years of redundancy pay with a subsequent pension should only be paid if the Commissioner does not obtain other employment."
"We must at last have a reform that produces openness, whereby documents in the Commission will at least also be available to Parliament as soon as the Commission has delivered them to a committee, an undertaking, a country, a journalist or another external party."
"We have drawn up a proposal on openness which we look forward to discussing with Mr Prodi at our public group meeting this evening at 7 p.m. in meeting room 2 here in the Palais building."
"Like every modern business, the Union must focus on what it can do better than others, or in other words leave alone tasks which others can do better or more cheaply, concentrate on cross-border cooperation and allow other matters to return to the Member States."
"This rationalisation must be carried out before the appointment of the new Commission, so there are many general reasons for postponing the approval of Mr Prodi, but my group also has a political reason: Mr Prodi wishes to see a United States of Europe."
"We would rather unite Europe in a Europe of the democracies."
"Mr Prodi, we regret that your timely speech comes at a moment of what I might call procedural confusion in both this House and the Council of Ministers."
"I welcome this morning's offer by the Council to cooperate with the Commission and Parliament."
"We would have appreciated an equally cooperative spirit in recent months, for example when it was a matter of the Members' Statute or the technical and procedural aspects of electing the Commission President."
"But if the Council has finally realised that it is one of the three components of Europe and must show due respect to the Parliament and Commission, we are pleased with this new discovery and hope that our future work will benefit."
"We, for our part, are convinced that the Commission President must have a strong Commission - as Professor Prodi stated this morning - a Commission whose relations with Parliament are transparent and based on timetables which are always respected, enabling us to work and make progress together, rather than engaging in confrontation."
"At the next part-session in July, therefore, Mr Prodi must present us with a schedule of the commitments to which he has so appropriately referred this morning; otherwise enlargement, which is now on the horizon, would prove impossible."
"You touched on many important points, Mr President, but allow me to recall that - in the opinion of Alleanza Nazionale - more attention should perhaps be paid to Mediterranean policy, especially since you yourself have stated that a Europe looking to the east obviously cannot pay sufficient attention to the serious problems of the Mediterranean. That goes without saying."
"You referred to the euro. Although you are an economist and this must sound very familiar to you, I would point out that if, before creating a common monetary policy, we had had the intelligence to create an economic policy, then perhaps the euro would not now be weaker than the dollar on markets around the world."
"If we had created an economic policy, we would have laid down the foundations, or guidelines, for Europe's economic future and might have reduced unemployment by a few percentage points, thereby restoring the confidence which the people are beginning to lose."
"In conclusion, Mr President, we are enthusiastic about your proposals and prepared to work with you, as a Parliament and as a political group, as long as your commitments are not only clear but also clearly timetabled, and as long as they are not merely declarations of intent at the start of your term of office but a definite path for us to follow together."
"Mr President, I welcome the Council President's announcement that the final vote on the entire Commission is to be brought forward."
"This is without doubt an important matter: as Parliament has stressed several times, the Commission must be in a position to address itself to the outstanding issues as soon as possible."
"In contrast with previous occasions, I also welcome the preparatory work done by Mr Prodi, the nominee for President, with regard to reform of the Commission."
"He has indicated important changes in respect of teamwork, responsibility and transparency, with a view to tackling and solving satisfactorily the crisis affecting the Commission."
"I would stress that, irrespective of the crisis in recent months, there has been a blurring of the Commission's political role over the past few years."
"Indeed, the crisis of the past few months could make us forget that the EU needs a politically strong Commission. This, Mr Prodi, is what the European Parliament expects you to achieve."
"You can be sure that, if you embark on this road, you will receive strong support from the European Parliament."
"We are opposed to any reduction in the Commission's political role, and we regard the political balance between Commission, Parliament and Council as a cornerstone of European democracy. Naturally, this attempt to redefine the European Union's overall prospects also affects the responsibilities of Parliament and the Council - and we shall discuss this point among others with the new Commission."
"As far as you yourself are concerned, it is a matter of political leadership to make the Commission a strong partner in dialogue on the major unanswered questions determining the EU's development and identity. These political matters are also of great institutional relevance, as was stressed for example by Mr Martens, who pointed out that the reform of the relationship between the institutions will be a key theme in the years ahead."
"This is not an abstract issue; it relates to the way in which we tackle the main items on our agenda, such as enlargement, institutional reform as such, and the creation of a common foreign policy and defence structure which - as shown by the events in Kosovo - Europe desperately needs, since it is proving incapable of tackling independently crises such as the one under way in that region."
"Then there is the important matter of efforts to galvanise Europe's economy - you made several references to this in your speech - and to introduce a new but vital element of balance: a social dimension."
"Parliament, the Commission and the Council have been debating this matter for years."
"Attempts have sometimes been made to strike a balance between these two aspects: for example, the Delors White Paper sought to bring them together, to balance them."
"Perhaps much of this is no longer topical, but the problem of harmonising these two elements is one of the main political problems confronting not only the Commission but also Parliament and the EU in the years to come."
"I do not wish to dwell on this."
"The Commission will of course have its own political opinions here and will compare notes with Parliament and the Council."
"There have in the past been differences over strategy, which have subsequently been settled and have enriched the political debate between our institutions."
"This also applies to the Balkans."
"Mr President, I welcome your determination to put together rapidly the elements of an overall proposal for that region, so as to create a stable relationship offering a way out of existing and potential conflicts which - as you say - can be averted and resolved in the context of a close relationship with the European Union."
"This also applies to the Serbian people, who will free themselves of Milosevic as soon as they are offered the alternative of relations with Europe."
"Mr Prodi, there is broad-based satisfaction in this House over your nomination."
"You will realise from this morning's debate that we also expect a good deal of you, since we know you to be a man of great initiatives and ideals, but one who is at the same time extremely practical."
"Both of these attributes are needed to head the European Commission."
"These expectations are further fuelled by the boldness of your pro-European spirit and philosophy, which have emerged from your two speeches before this House. I hope - and I am quite sure - that they will be satisfied."
"We expect you to be proactive in exercising your prerogatives as President of the Commission, not only as guardian of the Treaties and of the acquis communautaire , but we also expect a bold initiative to carry forward the completion of the institutional structure, so as to give the Europe of the euro a real personality, identity and strength."
"One obvious item of unfinished institutional and political business, which is a challenge for the next parliamentary term and might well be proposed to our successors, is an undertaking to complete the building of Europe."
"The constitutional dialectic between the EU and its Member States over the next five years will probably be dominated by this challenge."
"The President of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, has said repeatedly: 'You have entrusted me with the task of safeguarding the value of the euro and guaranteeing price stability."
"If you leave me alone to pursue these objectives, I assure you that the consequence will be an increase in unemployment in Europe, because the instruments available to me will undoubtedly lead to new social problems."
"Hurry up and equip yourselves with institutions to run the economy: the European Central Bank on its own cannot tackle problems which are not of its making.'"
"We have taken the first tentative steps towards harmonising our economic policies: Mr Monti's blueprint for fiscal policy harmonisation has yet to be approved; the subject of a European employment pact is to come up at the forthcoming European Council in Cologne."
"Specific conclusions are required here too, after Mr Junker's initiative at the Luxembourg European Council, and after the Aznar and Blair proposals relying on labour market flexibility."
"Mr Strauss-Kahn made an interesting proposal just the other day."
"It is interesting because he is a Socialist and because he is French: he is a Socialist, and asserts that the problem of unemployment can only be addressed by setting a 3 % growth target; he is French, and asserts that we must begin to regard the Euro 11 Council as the first step towards a European economic government."
"Economic policy must be harmonised at European level. 'The impossible status quo' was the title of the document of the Florence Group."
"Well, Europe cannot stand still; if it stood still, it could go into reverse."
"Although we now have the euro, much remains to be done and we must press on."
"If the markets notice that the pace of politics is slackening, they will adapt by relaxing their sense of responsibility."
"This is already happening - it is what has happened since the introduction of the euro: we sense a slowdown in political responsibility and initiative."
"We are now feeling the effects on Europe's economic equilibrium of the economic slowdown in France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, countries which account for 80 % of our GDP."
"Unfortunately, everything is a matter of urgency for the EU."
"Another major challenge is the war in Kosovo."
"This morning we have at last heard some encouraging news from the United States, after the meeting between Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Clinton: there now appears to be a glimmer of hope."
"Europe, as such, has played no role whatsoever in this affair and is also demonstrating severe limitations in assisting the refugees, that is for sure."
"Not only NATO but also many countries, as well as Europe - which previously had always excelled at providing humanitarian aid - are incapable of meeting the challenges resulting from this war."
"Europe has still not activated the analysis unit for active conflict prevention policies - even though this House approved a proposal to that effect - and must regain its dignity, ambition and responsibility by taking an initiative."
"We detected such ambition in your speech, Mr President."
"Agenda 2000 undoubtedly goes in the right direction: that of integrating countries which have been knocking at Europe's door for ten years."
"But if Yugoslavia is both the reality and the metaphor illustrating the difficulty - even now - of ensuring the coexistence of different ethnic groups, then we must acknowledge - as you have done - that true coexistence can only be achieved in the bosom of Europe, and not by creating small statelets which are increasingly inward-looking and ethnically homogeneous."
"Therefore, confronted as we are by an international crisis which calls into question our certainty at the end of the Second World War - that war would never again be possible in Europe - we must set ourselves new, inevitably ambitious political aims if we really do wish to rediscover the soul of Europe to which you have often referred."
"Mr Prodi, you were nominated by the European Council within hours of NATO attacking Yugoslavia on the instructions of not only the United States President but also many EU heads of government - your electorate."
"Many of us had therefore been hoping that - not least to dispel the dark and unjust initial coincidence affecting your new term of office - after 40 days of war in Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and Voivodina, you would have found the right words today to appeal for an immediate cease-fire and some words of solidarity for all the innocent victims, on all sides, and then made some practical proposals for the reconstruction of the areas destroyed and for an early return of the refugees: the search for a European soul, Mr Prodi, as you once put it in this House."
"You chose a different option, however: you chose to define the war as 'painful but necessary'."
"As to the future, you merely referred to a general and - at present - vague international conference on the Balkans, skirting the pressing and highly urgent problems, and even evoking the unfortunate image of the 'common sword of Europe', an expression loathed by Jacques Delors."
"On environmental issues, you stated that the harmonisation of ecological taxes and of the Member States' environmental rules and regulations would be a priority."
"I would remind you that, according to the report from the European Environmental Agency a few months ago, eleven of the top twelve environmental problems have either worsened or remained the same within the European Union since 1995."
"It is not enough to mention the environmental troubles of Europe's cities, as you have done, without tackling the underlying cause: the disproportionate increase in private transport, partly fuelled by incentives to the car industry, and the simultaneous decline of public transport."
"Finally, Mr Prodi, I would ask you to clarify the disturbing passage in your speech of 13 April where you called for investment in research and development in the 'life sciences'."
"What do you mean by this: to push forward genetic engineering on an industrial scale, thereby bringing about eugenics?"
"I would very much appreciate a clear answer."
"Mr President, at the outset I want to congratulate Mr Prodi on his appointment by the European Council as President-designate of the Commission, and I am quite certain that recommendation will be ratified overwhelmingly by the European Parliament this week."
"I want to take the opportunity of wishing Mr Prodi well in his new and, indeed, highly responsible position."
"You, Mr Prodi, will be assuming the presidency of the Commission at a very challenging time for the European Union."
"Tough decisions and policy directions will have to be worked out by the Commission and this must be done in consultation with the European Parliament and the European Council."
"I would say at the outset that Parliament must recognise that if the European Commission is to oversee its duties in an effective manner, that may require more staffing resources in the future."
"We have to be assured that, as the process for the enlargement of the Union takes place, the Commission is appropriately staffed to deal with the challenges that lie ahead for it and, indeed, the European Union."
"The Union is built on a consensual approach."
"That has been the main foundation for the success of the European Economic Community and now the European Union over the last 40 years."
"It is important when tough decisions are taken that all 15 Member States of the Union are fully involved in such a process."
"It has been clearly proven that there is complete consensus across the length and breadth of Europe that balanced political programmes should be put in place."
"The Single Act, which heralded the need to complete the internal market where there would be free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, has been a notable success."
"The Maastricht Treaty put in place the European currency and has also proved to be an innovative act of political foresight on behalf of the Union itself."
"It is very clear that, as EMU takes a hold within the Union, the reduced cost of doing business and the elimination of transaction costs will ensure that European Union businesses become more competitive."
"This leads me to my next point: as the internal market and EMU become established, it is imperative that the poor regions of the Union secure appropriate regional, social, agricultural, fishery and cohesion funds so as to guarantee that they can compete on a level playing field with all other Member States of the Union."
"We do not and cannot afford to put in place a two-tier European Union where wealthier Member States are put in one bracket and poorer Member States in another."
"We need to upgrade the standard of living in many parts of the Union."
"My own constituency of Connacht-Ulster in the west of Ireland and the border counties has a strong case for long-term regional and social funds during the next Community support framework and thereafter."
"Long-term strategies must be put in place to ensure that the poorer and peripheral regions of my country are helped to become competitive in terms of the attraction of business, as well as the improvement of their respective transport and water-treatment services."
"It is also clear that a framework must be put in place to permit new Member States from Eastern and Central Europe to join the European Union."
"It is important that these countries endeavour to comply with as much of the European body of law in the form of directives and regulations as possible."
"This is known as the implementation of the EU acquis and is also important in the context of giving opportunities to Irish and European businesses to start up their operations in these countries."
"In conclusion, the addition of an extra 70 million people to the Union must be viewed positively."
"This is good news for the broadening of the trade relations with all Member States of the Union itself."
"Mr President, Mr President-designate of the Commission, speaking as the chairman of Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights, I would like to remind you of the statement that was made on 23 March, in which Parliament said that there should be a considerably higher proportion of women in the Commission than is the case at present."
"However, you have not made any significant comment with regard to this request."
"Now you have the opportunity to do so, as not only is the European Parliament in its entirety here today, but also many of its political groups, which have discussed this important issue on a previous occasion."
"As the Treaty of Amsterdam has now entered into force it is incumbent on all the institutions to ensure that the issue of equality between men and women is an integral part of their programme."
"This must also be visible inter alia in the composition of the Commission."
"It has come to my attention that there is in existence an unofficial list of candidates for membership of the Commission, and that on this list there are only three women."
"This is a completely unacceptable state of affairs."
"There are five women in the present Commission, and it would certainly be a massive leap backwards if we were not to aim for a larger number of female Members of the Commission."
"I would like to point out that the Member States with small populations do not have any kind of prerogative in this matter, but we must insist that small Member States, with just one Commission Member, should recognise that women too are experienced and qualified, and that there are female candidates to be found."
"Mr Prodi, you are required to discuss this issue with the Member States, and I would ask you now whether or not you intend to raise the matter with the Heads of State and Government?"
"Mrs Hautala, could you also let us see the unofficial list which is in your possession?"
"In that way we could perhaps join you in worrying about it!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Prodi, yours is a difficult task, but at the same time you have it easy: it is difficult because of the challenges with which the European Union will be faced in the next five years, and easy because Parliament, the Council and the European public have never before shown such strong support for a new beginning in the Commission."
"You want to bring the administration under political control, and you have our support for this."
"But please let your administration know that the balance has shifted between Parliament and the administration in Brussels, and that the administration must act accordingly in future."
"In the eyes of the European public the new Commission will be a European government."
"Perhaps the Treaty does not quite say so, but you need to want to be a sort of European government."
"In your statement you mentioned almost all the key words for the next five years: agriculture and towns, competition and social affairs, youth, the elderly, public limited companies, small and medium-sized enterprises, consumer protection and liberalisation, enlargement and relations with the USA."
"However, Mr Prodi, I would have liked to see rather less pointillism and rather more constructivism in the picture you painted of the new Commission's work."
"Finally, Mr Prodi, in tomorrow's vote we shall be endorsing both yourself as an individual and your political work to date."
"This will strengthen your future political authority."
"We expect you to use this political authority in forming the new Commission and in your political leadership of the new Commission over the next five years."
"Tomorrow you will be given a preliminary vote of confidence - including from my group - but you should not be under the impression that you can rely on this confidence for five years."
"You will have to build this trust yourself through your work."
"We are prepared to help you because we believe it will serve Europe."
"We wish you every success."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the candidate designated by the European Council for the office of Commission President, Mr Prodi, will come into office in a situation unknown to any of his predecessors."
"No one has been nominated Commission President in a crisis of this kind, and no one before him became Commission President with direct democratic legitimation from a directly-elected Parliament."
"I believe that both these factors will enable him to meet the considerable challenges which he and the future Commission will face."
"Like Klaus Hänsch, I too would like to say that as a result of your great achievements, Mr Prodi, you will have our vote of confidence and our hopes will rest on you."
"During your period of office you will have to achieve two things at the same time. You will have to ensure the consolidation of the European Union, whose tasks and size have increased dramatically in recent years and decades and, where necessary, you will have to put the Union's house in order to ensure that it is viable and able to function even if nothing new is added."
"At the same time you are expected to have vision."
"These are two things that are seldom compatible but because of the historical situation they must both be achieved: consolidation and vision."
"I believe that in the knowledge of what happened with the former Commission you will undertake the necessary institutional reforms; furthermore, you will tackle the issues of personal accountability, internal controls and financial control, increased efficiency and the related right of control of the European Parliament over the Commission."
"In the coming weeks and months we will certainly have to devise ways to organise the interaction between the Commission and Parliament as its supervisory body, with the relevant reporting and the provision of information to Parliament's committees."
"However, it is not only the radical structural reform of the Commission, for which Parliament has put forward concrete proposals, that is at issue; we also have to recognise that the European Parliament must be reorganised in the same way in order to do justice to its tasks."
"We too still have work to do if we are to deal properly with our new rights and the extra rights that Mr Verheugen rightly called for the European Parliament to be given."
"We are also all aware that because of its lack of transparency the third main institution, the Council, is a significant obstacle to acceptance among the public."
"We will only be able to promote the European Union in the eyes of the people if it proves itself to be efficient, transparent and democratic at the same time."
"These three factors are required if we are to be accepted by the public."
"Mr Prodi, as I listened closely to your comments on economic policy, I heard a name that is not often mentioned by politicians and economists these days: Ludwig Erhard."
"You focused on the market and said that its opportunities must be used to the full because this is the best way to achieve growth and employment. However, you also talked about the fair framework conditions and rules that are necessary because the market cannot achieve this itself."
"You also said that because of this certain basic conditions must be created in the area of environmental policy, social policy, consumer policy, and safeguarding competition through controls on competition and on financial aid, so that the single market can function as a single market for the whole of Europe and not in small sections."
"But I have another particular problem with this, and in my view we need to solve a legitimation issue here."
"We have to acknowledge that economic and monetary union is a Community operation."
"Yet when I see how the finance ministers deal with it and in particular when I look at the role of the 'Euro 11', I realise that decisions are increasingly slipping into the intergovernmental sphere and that there is little democratic legitimation there for important decisions concerning economic and monetary policy which run parallel to the independence of the European Central Bank."
"I believe that there is a lot of work yet to be done in institutional terms between Council, Commission and Parliament to prevent this from slipping out of the Community sphere, with the result that the finance ministers become the new masters of Europe."
"As regards vision, you commented on the need for foreign representation and on our ability to use enlargement to extend the peace that we have achieved within the Union to the whole of Europe, including the Balkans, for example."
"The enlargement of the European Union is certainly one of the fundamental tasks that you will be faced with during your period of office, but an institutional round table is needed on this. In my view it should be organised very quickly and it must set the scene for enlargement, for example by extending majority voting and later - but not too late, and quickly - not as a condition for enlargement but in the progression towards the goal of a constitution and a constitutional treaty."
"Mr Prodi, you demonstrate the fact that we are, in my view, returning to a Europe of values."
"The European Union must not be seen by the people only as a single market, it must be a Europe of common values and a common culture."
"Our culture gives us more in common than it does to divide us, but all our talk at the moment is about what divides us."
"We should talk about what we have in common!"
"What distinguishes us in our values and our cultures is not something divisive but a plus, a diversity and an additional wealth."
"If in this discussion of the fundamental issue of values we can present the kind of Europe once called for in this House by Václav Havel, then we will once again be in a position to find favour with our citizens, who want more than just a single market."
"Mr President, I welcome Mr Prodi's commitment, in his speeches both last month and today, to carrying out the necessary reforms so as to renew and strengthen the European institutions, in particular his commitment to an increasingly transparent, collegial and efficient Commission, as well as to a greater role for Parliament and to an extension of majority voting in the Council."
"However, Mr Prodi, I remain confused about your approach to the economy and the environment."
"Your words convey the idea that development amounts to continuous growth, without any attention to the natural limits of resources."
"Infinite growth is a dangerous utopia believed in by economists, which cannot be borne out in reality."
"Admittedly, you have today called for an ecological tax to confront challenges such as climate change - and I am very glad - and you have spoken of sustainable growth, but is there not an obvious contradiction between these assertions and your excessive confidence in the results to be achieved from complete trade liberalisation under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation?"
"Rather than bringing about liberalisation, these agreements have concentrated the market in the hands of a few multinationals which have imposed a system of monopolistic control; the clauses on environmental, health and ethical safeguards as well as protection for the weakest peoples in the world have not been implemented since the GATT agreements."
"One need only think of the confrontation between the United States and Europe over trade in the furs of animals captured by cruel methods, over trade in bananas and hormone-treated meat, and above all over genetically modified organisms, particularly since the collapse of the Cartagena summit on bio-security due to US intransigence."
"Finally, although I welcome your proposal for stability in south-east Europe and an international conference on the Balkans to bring about peace in Europe, I must say that armed intervention has never led to peace; at the very most, it has stopped the fighting but without removing the causes."
"This is where Europe has failed."
"In the past it failed to act, but in acting now it has failed to prevent the conflict; and I cannot forget that one of the Italian Government's last decisions when you were Prime Minister, on 12 October 1998, was to make Italian airbases available to NATO in the event of a war in Kosovo."
"I nevertheless wish you all the best for your work."
"I hope that you will manage to meet the challenges of building Europe whilst taking account of issues such as the environment, health and peace, to which the European people are fully entitled."
"Mr President, every decade has its visions."
"In the 1980s Europe's vision was the completion of the internal market, in the 1990s it is monetary union."
"The forthcoming phase must be geared towards consolidation and improving and strengthening what has been achieved; it must be a period of root and branch and reform, as Tony Blair put it."
"The root refers to the Commissioners; you are personally involved in their selection and in their quality and success, and you are responsible for them."
"Renewing the structures, making the procedures more efficient and introducing transparent controls will be difficult enough."
"The new Commission must be genuinely new in terms of people, thinking and action."
"You and we owe this to the people of Europe."
"The branches refer to the organisation as a whole."
"It must be clear who is in charge of the administration."
"The report by the Committee of Independent Experts should help you in this, and Parliament's assistance is assured."
"It is not enough to try to make the overburdened bureaucracy more efficient."
"New approaches are needed by increasingly involving the Member States; subsidiarity also relieves the burden on Brussels in implementing European tasks and increases everyone's sense of responsibility - a sense of responsibility that has hitherto not existed."
"In your first statement you asked not to be judged on your past but on the visions and ideas that you bring to Europe."
"We will hold you to that."
"Mr President, I was very impressed by Mr Prodi's statement. In my view, he certainly possesses the qualities needed to become a great President of the Commission."
"As far as Parliament is concerned, I am sure Mr Prodi will pass with distinction."
"Nevertheless, this Parliament represents the people of Europe. I myself speak for the Spanish Socialist delegation in the European Parliament."
"Those of us who hail from the south of Europe hope that under Mr Prodi, more account will be taken of certain issues which tended to be sidelined by the previous Commission, that is, those issues concerning relations with the southern flank of Europe."
"Europe has certainly shifted northwards and eastwards in recent years."
"This followed the fall of the Berlin wall and enlargement to include countries in central and northern Europe. Plans for further enlargement towards the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are now under way."
"There is more to Europe than a single direction however, and we also need to bear in mind the concerns felt along the southern shores of the Mediterranean."
"The major conflict we are confronted with at the moment is of course in the Balkans, which are at the crossroads between Central and Eastern Europe and southern Europe."
"They represent a fault line running across Europe which may well give rise to further problems."
"We must therefore also give consideration to Mediterranean Europe, along with Europe's involvement in the Maghreb and the Mashreq, the Middle East and even those countries in southern Africa awaiting our cooperation, the ACP countries and the countries of Latin America."
"Focusing on a different aspect, I feel that the results of the Berlin European Council have been unduly influenced by economic and technocratic considerations to the detriment perhaps of more fundamental political considerations."
"In particular, no progress has been made towards improving conditions in rural areas and the agricultural policy is still beset by difficulties."
"The lack of a European policy for social and economic cohesion is certainly causing problems too."
"Furthermore, the present relationship between the more developed and the less developed countries and regions has to change."
"If it does not, there is a risk that we shall find ourselves in a two-speed Europe with regard to economic and social conditions."
"As Professor Prodi is well aware, the more developed countries and regions seem to be consolidating their economic progress whereas the less developed areas seem destined to remain firmly fixed in their disadvantaged position."
"As I see it, the economic and technocratic considerations which dominated at the Berlin European Council must be counterbalanced by a Community economic policy which takes into account all the interests of each and every one of the regions and countries of the European Union."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, May 1999 will go down in history as one of Europe's best and worst months politically speaking."
"It is one of the worst because of the awful events of this spring with the war in Kosovo, the crimes, the deportations and the political weaknesses of our Union which neither we nor you must forget."
"Fortunately, France and Europe are leading the humanitarian action to remedy and alleviate the worst effects, having failed to avoid these."
"It is one of the best because your appointment, Mr Prodi, gives us hope and a renewed determination."
"Clearly this is because of who you are, as many of us have already said and written, but also and particularly because of the conditions of your arrival."
"You are fortunate in that you will be the first Commission President to be appointed as a result of the principle of responsibility."
"Modern democracy aims to be like a temple with foundations of human rights and two pillars of universal suffrage and the principle of responsibility."
"I am pleased to have heard the word responsibility said so many times this morning."
"And just look at our Europe."
"It is celebrating fifty years of the Council of Europe whose foundations are so dear to so many of us."
"Look at our European Community celebrating twenty years of its Parliament being elected by the people."
"Look at our European Union celebrating the birth of political responsibility, which has come about in rather a strange way as we all know."
"Thanks to this Parliament, and within it the European Socialists led by Mrs Green, the previous Commission was overturned."
"Some of its Members did their work well while others did not, but overall it failed politically."
"Parliament told it so and it resigned."
"That was the revolution in mid-March."
"The embryonic European public opinion then called you, Mr Prodi, into its emerging arena and the Heads of State and Government listened to that opinion."
"This can be regarded as progress."
"You will allow me as a man of the left to remind you that these Heads of State and Government are also from the left and that the first duty of a left-wing democrat is to listen to the people."
"Your speech this morning on full economic liberalisation offends us as Socialists."
"But we realise that it stems from your need for consensus and that that is the situation we are in."
"We will therefore vote in favour of your appointment."
"In mid-June the electors will vote in another election for a new Parliament, a new majority and a new Commission."
"European democracy is moving forward."
"This is why in welcoming you, Mr Prodi, it is our democracy which we are honouring, but without forgetting our responsibilities."
"Antonio Gramsci spoke of pessimism of the mind and optimism of the heart when he was faced with fascism."
"You could and you must repeat this phrase today so that our confidence in you will be renewed and our Europe will be renewed."
"Then we can build that democratic temple and be true to our ideal."
"I am grateful to Mr Duhamel for his kindness in quoting an Italian who, in turn, took that quotation from a great French man of letters."
"Mr President, Mr President-designate, at the last full part-session of the European Parliament, we are facing a worried electorate in a continent at war."
"You will be facing a more assertive and more confident European Parliament which has expectations of you."
"It has expectations of your managerial ability, your communication skills, your strength and your integrity."
"On managerial skills, you have to inculcate a culture of reform to thousands of people."
"You have to make reality the codes of conduct which have appeared very late."
"You have to lead a team of Commissioners and you have to master details of administration."
"We want from you management by walking about."
"We want you to do spot checks and to be responsive to detailed criticisms."
"We need from you communication of a vision and clarity of ideas, but they have to be acceptable ideas."
"Tax harmonisation is not an acceptable idea for example to my delegation so you cannot promulgate ideas which are not politically acceptable."
"We need you to be able to communicate with us and with the citizens of the European Union."
"Above all, we require of you strength and integrity."
"You have to be able to give adequate answers to the sort of hostile newspaper articles which are in the United Kingdom's press today, for example."
"That we expect of you."
"In return we will support you as critical friends."
"We have decided to change our rules to make it clear to everyone that we will monitor expenditure in every spending committee."
"The price of your failure would be awful."
"It would be the destruction of the European ideal."
"But the reward for your success, which is what we expect and what we will help you with, will be a new confirmation of the wisdom of working together in international cooperation in the European Union."
"Mr President, the new Commission's policy cannot be all things to all men."
"It cannot be excessively liberal and yet be social and ecological at the same time."
"You are therefore being called upon to produce a new outline in order to create a new European social and ecological model."
"Europe is currently receiving bad press among workers."
"Public services are being dismantled and universal service is not a remedy."
"Many workers are unemployed due to liberalisation and globalisation."
"Although wealth is constantly increasing, poverty and exclusion, unemployment and precarious employment are growing."
"You will be required, Mr Prodi, to put an end to this scandal and see to it that the European Union becomes a Europe for all."
"The reformist approach you are setting out will require a majority in favour of progress."
"You will no doubt obtain a very large majority within this House and I hope that this majority will remain stable after the elections."
"In this respect, I must remind this House and the Commission of the fact that the Amsterdam Treaty gives the European Parliament new rights and also new duties. In my opinion, one of these is the duty of stability."
"I believe that the vote for Mr Prodi and the vote for the new College will establish a pact of confidence between Parliament and the Commission that should last for five years."
"Parliament, which cannot be sanctioned in this institutional system, cannot constantly change the majority or use the motion of censure, except in cases of extreme political danger."
"In addition, a pact of confidence commits the Commission to being serious-minded about political planning."
"Each year, in order to establish the budget and work programme, we must examine the state of progress of the political programme which we will approve with the new College."
"To conclude, Parliament and the Commission must commit themselves to achieving a new level of quality in their political work."
"Mr President-delegate, your appointment will be one of the crowning moments in the institutional relationship between the European Parliament and the Commission."
"The Greek Socialist MEPs hope you will be appointed."
"However, the appointment of the President of the Commission is not just a passing event."
"It creates a relationship of mutual trust and cooperation between the Commission and those who represent the people of Europe."
"Mr President, the people of Europe have unfortunately become mistrustful."
"Past wrongdoings have undermined the credibility of the European Union."
"Democracy's response to this has been to institute transparency."
"But transparency will never function simply because it is written into the Treaties."
"It will function if the Commission wants it to and if Parliament permanently demands it."
"Strict monitoring by Parliament is not an act of aggression, it is an act to safeguard the good reputation of the institutions."
"I hope with all my heart and, following your speech today, we believe that a new, valuable and constructive period is opening up in the relations between the Commission and Parliament."
"Once Parliament has confirmed your appointment and endorsed your Commission, we hope that this period will be one of transparency, democracy, human rights and, above all, a time of peace."
"On the subject of peace, Mr President, I think we all need to understand that, on whatever battlefield the dead may fall, they are all equal."
"Mr Prodi, you are the second President of the Commission I will be involved in selecting."
"That gives me some experience."
"I must admit that after the first two meetings we had together, I was not entirely happy, but now I can say that I was very pleased with the speech you gave here in Parliament today."
"I am glad that the environment, consumers and employment were included in your speech."
"I am glad that you stress the fact that it can be beneficial to cooperate."
"However, there is one thing I am not happy with, and that is the high priority given to the liberalisation of trade within the WTO."
"I agree, Mr Prodi, that we should strengthen the role of the Commission within the WTO, but I would warn against jeopardising the social dimension and against holding consumers and the environment to ransom."
"It is extremely important for us also to consider the third world, the poor countries, and to make the WTO work in that context."
"The other thing I would like to mention today is your task of reforming the Commission's work and working methods - the new business culture."
"I am happy with what we have heard today. I hope that the institutions, in other words the Council, Parliament and the Commission, can cooperate on this in future."
"I have one question: do you share my view that a new start is synonymous with having new Commissioners in all positions?"
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Prodi for saying so early in his introductory address that he is going to devote a great deal of thought to the issue of transparency and openness."
"I should like to stress that in point of fact Parliament has taken many concrete decisions on what the concept of openness and transparency involves."
"I am firmly convinced that Parliament will not retreat from the position it has already adopted."
"In my view, it is to some extent a question of turning the principle of possibly being open when forced to be so into one of seeking to be as open as possible from the start."
"Moreover, it is not just a matter of providing information about the institutions' own situation, but of supplying documents and answering the questions which people ask."
"I believe that it will require a much sturdier framework and more rigorous staff training."
"Consequently, it will demand a great deal of effort; it is not enough simply to say that we would like greater openness."
"However, I am holding fast to Mr Prodi's commitment in this respect and I also hope that he understands that a great deal of effort will be needed as well, in order to achieve results."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, you have been given an almost incredible amount of praise and recognition, and I am sure you not take it amiss if I introduce a negative note to this whole affair."
"I will say first of all that the Austrian Social Democrats will also support you."
"But I will say quite openly that this is not out of total conviction but on the basis of your achievements to date and as an initial vote of confidence."
"It is obvious that you could not provide answers to several questions at this stage."
"What bothers me a little - and this is the point I would like to focus on - is the fact that you placed too much emphasis on the market and too little on the social aspects."
"As a tribute to our President, I would like to deal with this using Gramsci terminology."
"Hegemony - in this case the hegemony of the market - disturbs me both as an economist and as a supporter of the market economy, as we in Europe have developed a model of the social market economy that is concerned particularly with reducing and preventing unemployment."
"I admit, Mr Prodi, that you have stated clearly today for the first time, as far as I know, that you also want to combat and prevent the causes and sources of unemployment."
"But that is still a little too weak for me - it still lacks substance."
"I will say it clearly once again: we must strengthen market forces."
"But we must also be aware that the market can only function in our model if there is as little unemployment as possible and as few social weaknesses as possible in our society, as otherwise the people of Europe will not come along with us."
"In this respect I welcome you now as our new Commission President and hope that you will be able to restore this balance."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, I agree with Mr Swoboda's negative outlook and I want to emphasise it somewhat."
"I have listened to you three times today, each time with as much pleasure, but I noted on all three occasions that you did not mention once the concept of Europe as a social union."
"This concerns me."
"You naturally spoke about employment but you said nothing about European social dialogue."
"Nor did you mention the need to establish the basic range of fundamental social rights, without which we will see relocations through fiscal dumping."
"And although you again announced that the Commission would be developing the liberalisation of the market in goods and services, I heard nothing about public services and the services of general economic interest which now clearly appear in Article 7d of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"You really must reassure us in this respect if you want your Commission to be in full working order."
"Do not forget your left wing."
"Mr Prodi, you say that you are a man of conviction, with which we agree, and that your beliefs are based on European integration."
"Like you, we are also proud of the enormous effort which was needed to bring certain countries, in particular yours and mine, into the leading group of the European Union and into the euro."
"However, the subject today is the future."
"You mentioned this, particularly with regard to your plans for a new, transparent and efficient Commission organisation."
"I am not sure if it is positive or negative that you spoke more about the practical side than the theoretical side. This contrasted with the rest of your speech which was more philosophical, emphatic and profound than pragmatic."
"I must therefore ask you to clarify certain points."
"Do you consider that the current institutional framework in which the Commission lies, formed by the principle of parity and equality between Member States, is an essential and historic principle of the Union or do you adhere to the more contemporary arguments which press for prompt and urgent reform?"
"Specifically, should the institutional reform of the Commission, particularly with regard to the number of Commissioners, be carried out in the context of the Treaty in force or are you in favour of an early revision?"
"This is an issue which cannot be avoided even though it is very delicate."
"The impression you gave us is that you did not want to talk about it, which is a shame because clarity in these matters is essential to allow us to accept the rest of your commendable reform proposals."
"It is not just a question of 'putting the house in order'; it is also absolutely essential to reinforce its foundations."
"Mr President, I wish to address just one issue."
"It is an important matter from the point of view of Parliament that you, Mr President-designate of the Commission, should, in the performance of your duties, make a credible commitment to the reforms that Parliament has called for from the next Commission, and that when you are involved in the selection process with governments, you insist on commitment to those reforms on the part of every Member of the Commission, both separately and jointly."
"I believe it should also be mentioned that those Members of the present Commission who have performed their duties well, and who are committed to the reforms, will also be needed in the next Commission, as, otherwise, the reforms will not be introduced sufficiently promptly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely grateful to you for this debate, which has been thorough and wide-ranging. As has been pointed out, you have expressed your confidence in me and your expectations of me, which I very much appreciate and for which I feel very responsible."
"The debate has also quite rightly revealed that your confidence is conditional, based on my word, because that is all I can offer for the time being."
"Therefore, all that remains for me to say here and now is that I am, quite frankly, very aware of how difficult a time this is and how great your confidence in me is, but also of the fact that I am being put to the test by you and will be even more so by the next Parliament, before which I shall have to return with the full Commission team."
"On behalf of the Commission team, I shall have to give a hard and fast guarantee of the promises and commitments which I have made during the debates on 13 April and today."
"Obviously, an act of government is embodied in a government; it cannot simply be summarised in a programme."
"I therefore just wish to tell you that I feel responsible for the major tasks which you have outlined for the Commission: I fully share your desire that the Commission should return to, or rather should finally assume, its role as stipulated in the Treaties - that of taking initiatives and making policy proposals - and should do so with great clarity."
"Clarity has always been an issue."
"I would remind you that clarity depends on a definition of responsibilities, and I undertake to work hard in this area, which was one of the main causes of the recent crisis: clarity concerning the Commission's collective political responsibility, but also that of the individual Commissioners who are in charge of portfolios and responsible for managing them, as well as the key administrative responsibility for running the Directorates-General."
"This is a problem of fundamental importance, which I wished to tackle head-on by defining the function of the Cabinets - one of the difficulties which has led in the past to tension and misunderstanding."
"Next, I am grateful to you for having reminded me of the delicate relationship which will exist between the Commission and the Council, on the one hand, and between the Commission and Parliament on the other."
"It is a much stronger Parliament, a Parliament which has acquired strength, as happens at times of major institutional growth."
"I shall therefore have to be transparent, clear and absolutely beyond reproach in my dealings with Parliament;"
"I realise this."
"There has also been some difficulty concerning the timing of the investiture."
"Mr Verheugen, on behalf of the Council, has stressed the need for a rapid investiture procedure. Mr Cox, however, has stressed that a high-profile parliamentary debate should be held to endorse the new Commission."
"I believe that both these demands are of great importance; all I can say is that I shall be ready with the entire new team of Commissioners on the day when the new Parliament takes office."
"I can - and must - make this undertaking to you, so as not to hold up the investiture by a single hour."
"Naturally, I hope that this will take place rapidly. I repeat, however, that I realise the debate will have to be detailed and thorough in every respect."
"Today's debate has raised another considerable, deep-rooted problem to which I believe we shall have to return in coming years."
"I have been accused of having too much confidence in the market and too little in social Europe."
"Let us be quite clear: if we put these two terms in contradiction with each other, we shall ruin commercial Europe as well as social Europe."
"Let us remember that, if we are to give hope to the third world, for which we bear enormous responsibility - indeed, we cannot forget that Europe is the largest economic body in the world; I repeat, the largest economic body in the world - then clearly we must also guarantee a world economic order."
"The opening-up of trade over the past few years has led to growth in certain countries which were totally outside the world economy before, and has consequently led - I understand this, and it has emerged in the debate - to serious problems in certain European sectors and certain European countries."
"But let us not forget that, if we fail to meet this challenge, we will badly disappoint the third world and will fail in our duty to this earth, which has become so complex."
"This, I assure you, does not detract from - indeed it enhances - the importance of the social dialogue: it becomes all the more important to look after those who are marginalised, the poorest members of society."
"But we cannot discuss these matters behind closed doors, or as a continent which erects borders, albeit one that has been enlarged."
"We must do so by meeting the challenge which, in this case, is also a responsibility."
"You may think I am saying this to receive your endorsement or backing."
"That is not true!"
"I, for my part, am firmly convinced in economic terms that the European edifice must be supported by twin pillars."
"If we really do close our doors, then from the point of view of both peace and development in this world of ours, we shall cause the most serious problems."
"I am well aware that this opening-up means that change must be much faster than it was in the past, and that change leads to disruption."
"The task of the Commission and Parliament, together with the Council, is to move forward in this direction, to assume responsibility for change, because there could obviously be a strong temptation now to close our doors and fall back on conservative positions."
"That is why we have all devoted ourselves to this major task of introducing progressive reforms."
"I have outlined a few points here; I have referred to transparency, organisational change, changed relations between the Commission and Parliament, and a change in the structure of administrative relations."
"Obviously this is a gradual process."
"Anyone who reproaches me for not having come here with a complete edifice is absolutely right."
"The type of procedure, the type of work which we are building is progressive."
"Apart from anything else, even though the responsibility will be mine, I shall have to take account of the second report of the Wise Men, to be published in September, just as I have taken account in my thinking so far of their first report, although I repeat that I shall be responsible for the decisions."
"These documents are vital in shaping our ideas, in organising our thoughts."
"That is why our working relations must be continuous, well balanced and strong; that is why, as I have often said, the composition of the Commission must be well balanced, not only politically but also between men and women."
"I wish to say in this respect that there is no list of Commissioners, not even a provisional one."
"I have said clearly to the Heads of State and Government, with whom I am establishing an ongoing dialogue to put together a fine Commission: 'let us not name any names until after the elections!'"
"First of all out of respect for certain countries which have their own internal acceptance procedures; secondly, because we must begin by setting out our work programmes and intentions, and then we can build the Commission."
"I think it would be utterly wrong to proceed in the opposite fashion."
"Therefore we shall name names after the elections; all those already mentioned are mere rumours, which count for nothing."
"That is why, as I have said, I am preparing the ground now: once election-time comes the government will be formed, in time to be presented to Parliament at its first sitting."
"That is my plan."
"I should like to touch on a few more points, ones which I think you raised with particular emphasis and passion during the debate."
"I shall not speak about defence."
"Some of you took what I said negatively, as though I were attaching priority to the sword rather than to the budget or the currency."
"The facts, though, are very plain: it is difficult to build a new, serviceable edifice without giving it a defensive structure."
"It will take time: I am aware of the Commission's limitations, I am aware of its powers."
"Finally, the fight against poverty and marginalisation and the problem of growth."
"Once again, let us not try to build the future using outdated economic concepts."
"It is absolutely untrue that the new model of growth will inevitably be harmful to sustainable development and the environment."
"New growth is totally different from that of the past."
"The fact is that Europe has not been able to embark with sufficient speed on the road to new growth, which involves above all the following new sectors: software, telecommunications and also, harking back to my last speech, what I referred to as the 'life sciences'."
"These encompass major sectors, ranging from pharmaceuticals to fine chemistry to health appliances: sectors in which Europe is extremely weak and has huge scope for job creation and for harnessing intelligence."
"I would however recall that, in this field more than any other, ethical problems must never come second to economic ones."
"Let that be clear!"
"This applies not only here; we must make a total, general commitment to this effect because it is part of our overall objectives."
"Lastly, I referred a moment ago to our obligations to the outside world."
"I have not spoken of these this morning because I did so last time;"
"I regard the two speeches as twin episodes in a single chapter which we must write together."
"That is why I did not specifically go into the problem of the Mediterranean this morning, but dwelt above all on the Balkans."
"I would however stress that our responsibility towards the Mediterranean countries is immense."
"It is immense because the situation confronting us is becoming increasingly difficult and almost untenable socially, economically and especially in regard to the organisation of government structures."
"No one else can perform this role, and we cannot possibly refuse it now."
"I merely wished to recall these points over and above what I said in my previous speech, in view of your objections and suggestions, for which I am most grateful."
"I wish to close with another very brief remark concerning Kosovo."
"Our task here is increasingly enormous."
"Let us remember that the political, social and economic reconstruction of the Balkans will to a large extent, if not exclusively, fall to Europe."
"Let us remember that we must provide an institutional framework enabling these peoples to feel secure and allowing them not only to maintain their own structures but also to step up their relations with Europe, so as to have their own prospects for the future."
"To conclude, I thank you and I hope that our discussions will continue to be constructive."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I asked a question about whether by a 'new start', Mr Prodi meant that there should also be an entirely new Commission, in other words that there should be no reappointment of any of the old Commissioners."
"I did not receive an answer to my question."
"If I have understood correctly, I am being asked whether or not the new Commission will include any Commissioners from the old one."
"There is nothing to prevent that; it depends on the capability and the ethical and professional conduct of a Commissioner."
"I see no reason for any prohibition here."
"Thank you, Mr Prodi."
"I have received a motion for a resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 32."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Mr Ephremidis would like to speak on the Balkans, but the debate on Kosovo is to take place this afternoon;"
"I think he will have an opportunity to comment then."
"We shall now proceed to the votes."
"Mr Ephremidis, you have been in this House long enough to know that Members are not allowed to speak if the President does not give them the floor."
"Mr Imbeni did not give you the floor."
"VOTES"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we shall now proceed to a long list of votes which contains a new element."
"These are the first votes that will take place under the new Rules of Procedure which we adopted during the last part-session."
"I have to say that a study we carried out today of the votes that will take place showed that the modifications introduced by Richard Corbett, Ana Palacio and Vice-President Gutiérrez Díaz are important and change a good many things."
"I think that voting has been simplified considerably."
"Many old ways of doing things have also been changed, and I would like to ask you for your support and understanding."
"I would point out to the House that, as a departure from our usual procedure, if the report by Mr Fayot is adopted, it will come into force immediately and not from the next part-session, so that it can be implemented for the next proposals that will be put to the vote."
"For it to be adopted, it requires an absolute majority of 314 votes."
"Parliament adopted the decision"
"Mr President, could you please explain why in the last part-session a simple majority was sufficient to amend the annexes, whereas today an absolute majority is needed to amend an annex?"
"Mr Herman, there is a difference between the provisions in the annex to the Rules of Procedure which refer to discharge and those in the annex to the Rules of Procedure which relate to other votes."
"The former require a reinforced majority whereas the latter do not."
"Mr President, I had asked to speak before this amendment was put to the vote as I am not sure that it was admissible."
"We have just adopted an amendment to Article 5 of Annex V to the Rules of Procedure which states, with regard to both the granting and refusal of discharge, that the proposal for a decision on granting discharge may not be the subject of amendments."
"You said that this would take effect immediately. However, this amendment actually concerned the paragraph on the proposal for a decision."
"I must therefore say that when we are rushing through texts, we should at least take a minimum amount of care to ensure that they are respected."
"You have raised a point that we shall consider afterwards, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy."
"In any event, the amendment was not adopted."
"We shall look at it again."
"We are not infallible - only the Pope is infallible, not us."
"But since the amendment was not adopted, there is no problem."
"Parliament adopted the resolution"
"Mr President, I deeply regretted the haste with which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection voted for compromise amendments to Mr Lannoye's report on the proposal for a directive on honey."
"This simply weakened the report."
"These compromise amendments will not have the effect we are seeking, which is to limit the negative consequences on consumers and European honey producers of a directive which does not adequately protect the quality of good European honeys against imported honeys."
"Moreover, this situation is an open invitation to fraud."
"Unfortunately, it was no longer possible to amend these compromise amendments as I would have liked."
"Therefore, as I cannot resign myself to voting for texts which do not guarantee that the consumer will be able to easily distinguish between imported honey and quality honey produced in the Community, I abstained."
"The remainder of the report is not bad, although mixtures of honeys where part originates from outside the Community should also be marked 'imported honey'."
"Finally, I must state that in order to improve honey production and marketing, as referred to in my report on an ad hoc regulation and for which we have obtained EUR 15 million per year - although I had asked for EUR 65 million - stringent requirements are needed on the quality, control and labelling of honey."
"I regret that the Commission and the Council did not follow Parliament's lead as it unanimously approved my two reports on European apiculture and the improvement of honey production and marketing."
"I am hopeful that during the next parliamentary term we will be heard, as my struggle on behalf of honey producers and their high-quality products in Europe and the Community will continue inside or outside Parliament."
"Mrs Lulling, I gave you twice the time to which you were entitled since this is one of our last sittings."
"I am bound to give some small privileges - and they are of no great consequence - to colleagues who have been conspicuous by their presence in the Chamber!"
"We regret that this directive, which aims to bring in common rules on ingredients, will involve serious disadvantages for the Swedish jam market."
"Sweden has traditionally followed a different jam-making process from the European one, using more fruit and less sugar."
"The proposal that has now been approved means that jam with a much higher sugar content will dominate the Swedish market, which is regrettable."
"We have therefore decided not to participate in the decision."
"Moreover, we take the view that decisions on products such as these should be taken in a different context, rather than by the generally hard-pressed European Parliament."
"Since I do not think it is necessary to have a uniform EU definition of jam and marmalade, I do not feel that I should vote for the Lannoye report."
"Mr President, I abstained during the final vote on Mr Fayot's report on the amendment of Annex V to the Rules of Procedure."
"In my opinion, the provisions adopted respond to a particular situation."
"They aim to solve the problem relating to the 1996 financial year, and it is never advisable to amend general texts to solve a particular problem."
"However, I also have two formal comments to make."
"The first follows on from the comments made earlier by Mr Herman in relation to the fact that you decided that the amendments to Annex V to the Rules of Procedure would be adopted by an absolute majority."
"You were right in that respect since this is in accordance with the Treaty, which specifies that the Rules of Procedure shall be adopted by an absolute majority of the Members of Parliament."
"You - and by you I really mean the President's office in general - should actually have applied the same conditions to the adoption of the amendment to the other annex in the last part-session concerning the responsibilities of the parliamentary committees."
"There is no difference in the nature of these annexes."
"It is solely for the sake of convenience that these texts have been made into annexes to the Rules of Procedure because they would take up too much room in the main body of the Rules."
"However, in both cases the provisions are important and must be adopted under the same conditions as the main text itself."
"My second comment concerns the immediate entry into force of the Rules."
"We decided on this even though the committee's amendments were not adopted."
"We therefore voted on the Elles report without knowing exactly what we were voting on."
"In future, if we want to apply something quickly, we should allow at least one day in order to obtain the final adopted text. We should not vote without knowing exactly what we are voting on."
"The Rules of Procedure allow quicker application than that normally anticipated, namely in the part-session following their adoption, but immediate entry into force does not seem appropriate."
"My reason for rejecting Amendment No 4 was that I could accept it if it read as follows:"
"' The Council may unanimously decide exceptionally to authorise a qualified majority decision by which a Member State, acting on a proposal from the Commission ...'"
"Further to the Vienna European Council of 11 and 12 December 1998, the Commission has just forwarded to Parliament a proposal to amend Directive 77/388/EEC as regards the possibility of applying on an experimental basis a reduced VAT rate on labour-intensive services."
"In this proposal, the Commission is seeking to add a new paragraph 6 to Article 28 of the directive. This paragraph provides for a procedure enabling the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, to authorise any Member State to apply a reduced rate for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2002 to certain local labour-intensive services that meet specific requirements."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has indicated on several occasions that it believes that there is a direct link between a lower VAT rate and higher employment."
"This proposal to amend the directive is therefore heading in the right direction by offering Member States a positive option, which they will certainly use in a fairly general manner."
"However, the I-EDN Group voted against Amendment No 4 by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, which was adopted by 423 votes to 61."
"This amendment specifies that the Council should act by qualified majority and not unanimously."
"Yet according to the Treaty, all tax provisions governed by Community law must be adopted by the Council acting unanimously."
"Once again the supporters of a federal Europe are trying to go one step further by removing one of the Council's prerogatives to the benefit of the Commission."
"If qualified majority voting were adopted for taxation, as desired by the vast majority of Members, a whole chunk of national sovereignty would be swept away."
"This would seriously impinge on the right of each Member State to fix and collect tax."
"We all know that Parliament has frequently indicated its backing for the introduction of a European tax."
"In this case, with its shrewd support for a text allowing Member States to reduce VAT, it is trying to alter the legal basis of the Treaties by changing the procedure in the Council for adopting the Commission's tax proposals."
"Mr President, I must apologise for referring at such a late stage to the Minutes of yesterday's sitting."
"I have actually only just discovered that I was marked as absent whereas I was definitely here."
"Not having voted using the electronic system, I cannot prove this formally."
"However, I did move a motion for a resolution, and its inclusion in the list of topical and urgent subjects was opposed."
"I asked to speak in support of this motion and that was noted by Mr von Wogau and Mr Priestley."
"Unfortunately, the President at the time could not give me the floor but I was definitely here."
"Very well, that will be noted."
"Mr President, a shadow not predicted by the official experts is being cast over the broad economic policy guidelines for the coming year: a slow-down in European growth of approximately 2 % combined with a continued high level of unemployment of approximately 10 % on average throughout Europe."
"By contrast, the United States of America is growing twice as fast and its unemployment rate is half the European level."
"At the same time, and fairly logically, the euro has been falling against the dollar since it was launched at the beginning of the year."
"This situation quite clearly contrasts with the promise accompanying monetary unification that a new era of growth and employment would begin in Europe."
"Of course, you could say that the euro has only really been in use for four months and that it is therefore too early to come to any definite conclusions about this."
"However, this statement is not actually true because the bilateral parities between the European currencies were fixed just over a year ago, on 1 May 1998, and the objective of rigidly pegging the currencies to each other has prevailed for several years."
"Neither the euro nor the European management in general can therefore be easily exonerated of all responsibility."
"We are particularly conscious that growth is weaker in the countries at the centre of the euro system which contribute to the Structural Funds and stronger in the more peripheral countries or those which benefit from European aid."
"In essence, the question is whether or not the decline in the centre of the Union is weighing on Europe as a whole and whether or not European growth, which has thus been weakened by the Brussels management, is wreaking revenge by weakening the euro."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations wants the recovery of European growth to be assisted, firstly by reducing the compulsory levies for the Structural Funds, and secondly by relaxing the rigid management of the euro."
"We believe that a certain amount of currency flexibility must be restored and that the euro must be adapted to the specific situation in each country."
"This could be achieved by allowing the national currencies to remain, together with the euro, after 1 January 2002, with the euro then becoming a simple common currency."
"I will vote for the Fourçans report on the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community."
"The report is right to emphasise the need to establish closer coordination between broad economic policy guidelines and the employment policy guidelines, taking into account the need for a coherent strategy for employment, growth, stability and economic reforms and for improved procedure with regard to their content, their timing and the relationship between the Council committees involved."
"The rapporteur also has my support in calling for public/private investment to obtain a modern transport and communications infrastructure in the Union and I support his call to the Commission and the Council to find the appropriate financing mechanism - such as an expanded role for the EIB."
"We voted against the report for the following reasons:"
"1.The idea of a common economic policy is flawed in principle."
"The Member States' individual economic structures make it necessary to have a policy which takes account of national differences."
"Real convergence requires different policies."
"Formal convergence, on the other hand, results in conflicting policy outcomes.2.A common economic policy, controlled by the Union, constitutes a serious breach of national independence and encroaches on the role of national parliaments, whose prerogative in terms of economic policy is an essential part of democracy.3.In the report and the accompanying statement, the policy which is advocated represents biased theoretical ideas and a particular brand of political theory."
"It runs counter to many of the approaches and observations endorsed by modern economic science."
"The Menrad report - and it is appropriate here that Mr Berthu has just spoken about the economic situation - is attempting to revisit the issue of European employment policy in the run-up to the European Employment Pact which is sure to be concluded in Cologne."
"The great disaster, however, is that it now seems unlikely that the content of the Pact will really be any different under this new spirit of cooperation, since the employment guidelines are still those agreed in Luxembourg in all their ambiguity."
"The essential features of economic policy are this time extremely vague and unclear, with the result that for the time being we have no choice but to carry on as we are, which is extremely difficult in view of the number of problems we face."
"The market reforms that are to form the third component consist of a mixture - not yet clearly defined - of deregulation ideas and necessary framework definitions for fair competition in the internal market."
"So much as we welcome the fact that the European Union is preparing to create the conditions for a European 'polder' model in economic and employment policy, we must nevertheless warn against it if the structure is not also linked to the content. The aim must be to change the direction of economic policy and move to a policy that actually gives priority to long-term, sustainable employment, a policy that returns to the idea of the redistribution of labour, a policy that places the need to develop sustainability, meet the Rio commitments and achieve solidarity in dealing with and stabilising the European environment back at the forefront of European economic policy instead of regarding it as a type of aggregate micro-policy imposed by the large companies."
"The European Council in Vienna recommended a policy geared to growth and employment, integrating the macro-economic and economic policy dimensions."
"We believe that the current high level of unemployment constitutes a threat to the European welfare model."
"The fact that, year after year, millions of people are out of work is detrimental to the credibility of both society and democracy."
"The Menrad report on the European Parliament's contribution to the European Employment Pact is an important contribution to the strengthening of employment in Europe."
"We therefore welcome the report, with certain reservations."
"The report recommends exploring the possibility of an agreement between the labour market partners on a basic wage."
"In our view, this is not the right way to combat such things as social dumping."
"We believe that the focus should be on other measures instead, for example minimum standards in the area covered by employment law."
"The report also puts forward further demands, such as a relieving of the tax burden on companies' incomes and investments and a reduction in payroll taxes."
"In principle, we are opposed to such measures."
"We think it is extremely important to promote a climate in which companies can flourish, but that this is a national responsibility and one on which each Member State should adopt its own position."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of a report on the European Employment Pact."
"We are very positive towards giving priority to employment issues in economic policy, and therefore warmly welcome the Employment Pact."
"However, there are some paragraphs in the report which we cannot support."
"It calls, amongst other things, for the introduction of an agreement-based basic wage at European level."
"That is a bad idea."
"Wages are not a European concern."
"It also calls for a convergence of corporate taxes."
"We do not support the harmonisation of corporate taxes."
"However, we are strong supporters of the introduction of a minimum level of corporate tax at European level."
"Solving unemployment is the greatest challenge facing the European Union today."
"It cannot be accepted that 18 million Europeans are unable to find work."
"The European Employment Pact will not of itself solve this problem but it can make a contribution and it is a welcome recognition by the Member States that more can be achieved through cooperation than by individual countries acting alone."
"I particularly welcome the rapporteur's call for priority to be given to SMEs, strengthening R&D, encouraging environmental protection, the involvement of the third sector, improvements in education and training and the promotion of social inclusion."
"While the rapporteur is realistic in stating that 'special employment programmes for specific groups (young people, women, long-term unemployed, the disabled) cannot be predominantly financed at the EU level', I hope, nevertheless, that the Union will make a commitment to supporting these groups."
"I will vote for this report and trust the Cologne Council will give its contents serious consideration."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party believes that the following paragraphs in the above report are a matter of subsidiarity and, therefore, cannot support them:"
"Paragraph 13 - European-wide minimum wage; -Paragraph 14 - Convergence of corporation tax."
"Mr President, I must firstly congratulate the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations on being the group with the most representatives in the House at the moment."
"This being the case, they will be able to hear me - because I am actually partly in agreement with my friend Hervé Fabre-Aubrespy - when I say that this has occurred previously in the House."
"However, the immediate entry into force in the next minute of an act which has yet to be recorded in the Minutes is something completely new and is in accordance with the spirit in which we voted on the Elles report."
"I made a speech yesterday which I must reiterate today and I am pleased to have a small French audience for this."
"Actually though, I use the word small, but I should say large as you are the largest number to listen to me."
"My colleagues will remember a French left-wing politician saying that you are legally wrong because you are politically in a minority."
"This was actually said by one of our colleagues."
"With your approval, Mr Elles has slipped through the idea that when there is a majority, the rules, regulations and so on can be easily disregarded."
"We have therefore approved a text against which I fought as hard as I could."
"And I will continue to fight against this and I undertake to do so everywhere, both inside and outside this House and before the Court of Justice."
"This is because I cannot accept being a member of a parliament which votes for what is wrong and which therefore, in terms of the law, is making, passing and using laws which are wrong."
"The text which we have approved is totally wrong."
"We had said that we would not grant discharge to the Commission but this was not true."
"However, I have made this my undertaking and it explains why I voted against the text."
"I will try in every possible way to ensure that the rule of law remains our standard, despite Mr Elles and despite others."
"I will try to ensure that these concepts promoted by a faded left are not imposed on others."
"In my opinion, the rule of law cannot be separated from democracy."
"You will of course appreciate, as we do, that the House decides in all its wisdom."
"I cannot call that into question."
"The House decides in its wisdom on every occasion, and that is all there is to say."
"Mr President, I do not intend to continue the dialogue which you initiated just now on my speech."
"Instead I am going to give the expected explanation of vote on the Elles report."
"We approved this report particularly because of its first paragraph - please stay Mr Dell'Alba, just for a few more moments - and although I agree that this paragraph is not entirely realistic, its political significance is very clear in our opinion."
"For the first time, a majority of the Members of this House said very clearly that discharge could not be granted to the Commission in respect of the 1996 financial year."
"For the first time, it was clear that we would refuse to grant discharge when, on 17 December, we rejected a motion in favour of granting discharge tabled by the Socialist Group which had been adopted in extremis by a very small majority in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"We have also adopted and annexed to our report the reasons for the decision of 17 December 1998."
"These reasons involved a condemnation of the Commission and should have led at the time to a majority in Parliament censuring the Commission, as we ourselves proposed."
"Today we have witnessed not only some flights of fancy on the subject of paragraph 1 but also an extraordinary amendment by the Socialist Group attempting to delete this paragraph."
"I believe that this amendment tabled by the Socialist Group demonstrates the hypocrisy which some have been attempting to lead us towards since 17 December."
"The Socialist Group proposed that we should not say that we had refused discharge and it proposed that we should not annex to our report the comments of 17 December."
"If we had adopted the Socialist Group's amendment, as 212 of our colleagues unfortunately did, there would have been no mention of the refusal of discharge and these comments which, I must repeat, condemned the Commission, would have had no legal value."
"This is why I welcome the adoption of the Elles report."
"The political consequences of the debate surrounding Parliament's refusal to grant discharge to the Commission in respect of the 1996 financial year are widely known."
"For the first time in its existence, the Commission has had to resign en bloc due to the overwhelming evidence of its mismanagement."
"Much more could still be said or repeated on this issue."
"But to a certain extent, the Council and Parliament must also accept some responsibility for this crisis."
"Faced with the new challenges caused, in particular, by the collapse of the Berlin wall and the globalisation of the economy, neither the Council nor Parliament stopped to consider all the logical consequences, particularly in terms of hiring staff, before increasing the Commission's workload."
"The new Parliament and the new Commission will have to take over where we have left off in order to identify at a more leisurely pace, and hopefully in close cooperation, all the necessary conclusions and consequences."
"Having said this, I agree with the rapporteur that it is technically important for the time being to note the accounts of the EC budget for the 1996 financial year in order to proceed with work on the accounts of later years."
"We must once again bring to the attention of the public that this simple noting of the accounts cannot in any way be regarded as calling into question Parliament's refusal to grant discharge to the Commission for the 1996 accounts."
"I voted in favour of the Brinkhorst report postponing the discharge."
"It would be paradoxical for Parliament to approve this discharge before the end of its term when not all the information is available, when the second report by the Committee of Independent Experts is expected in the autumn and when the conditions for us to definitively approve this discharge are not therefore satisfied."
"However, I must underline the extraordinary nature of the vote in this House."
"Three amendments - Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 7 - tabled not by us but by the Green Group were rejected by a very large majority, with roughly 400 against and 115 for."
"Amendment No 2 recalled that, under Article 276 of the Treaty, the Commission must submit any necessary information to the European Parliament at its request."
"This amendment was rejected as the House considered that this duty of information required the Commission to submit to Parliament in full all the documents it deemed necessary to exercise this responsibility."
"So this amendment was rejected."
"Amendment No 3 recalled what happened with the ECHO dossier."
"Amendment No 7 simply recalled what happened with regard to the external staff hired by different companies."
"The 112 or 115 Members who voted in favour of these amendments are a credit to this House because they were expressing the belief that Parliament is entitled to scrutinise both the Commission and its implementation of the Community budget. They were also stating that the Commission must respect the Treaties by submitting the necessary information to Parliament."
"Those who voted against these amendments have not enhanced Parliament's image."
"They have clearly shown the hypocrisy of our situation over the last six months."
"If there had not been five independent people, appointed by Parliament, to deliver their very clear judgment on the workings of the Commission, we would still have the same Commission which would not have resigned and would not have been censured."
"We did not vote in favour of what the Elles report proposed because it fails to mention many issues regarding Parliament's budget."
"I intend to talk about the amendments which were not adopted, in particular Amendment No 3 and Amendment No 7."
"In Amendment No 3 we asked the Secretary-General to provide the Committee on Budgetary Control with a report on the reasons and circumstances which led to the decision to divide up the Directorate-General for Personnel, the Budget and Finance, on the effects of this decision and on the efficiency of the budget management and staff policy."
"This amendment was tabled by the Green Group."
"In Amendment No 7, the same group noted that Parliament had withdrawn a complaint on the financial claims and it wanted to know the consequences of this."
"Amendment No 9 recalled the conditions which should have led us to postpone the granting of discharge."
"Around 100 Members voted for these amendments."
"Just as Parliament must monitor the correct implementation of the Community budget, it must also check that its own budget is correctly implemented by the Secretary-General and all the officials whose honesty and qualities are not in question."
"It must therefore check that everything has been correctly implemented."
"Clearly we have questions about the 1997 financial year."
"We should have postponed our decision and I regret that we did not."
"This is why we could not vote for the report by our colleague Mr Fabra Vallés."
"Clearly the storm which swept away the Commission in the first part of this year has worried many people."
"It would be even more damaging to the credibility of the European institutions if such a storm were to affect Parliament."
"This just shows the importance we must place on examining the accounts of this House."
"In this period of deep doubt among the public, we must be even more careful not to allow room for the suspicions which are always so quick to appear and multiply."
"The Court of Auditors can and must help us in this task."
"It is, to a certain extent, the external guarantor of our institution's credibility."
"This is why, like the rapporteur, I wish to stress that the Court of Auditors may at any time investigate the extent to which Parliament's use of its appropriations from the budget conforms with the rules in force."
"The rapporteur has also highlighted certain failures that must be corrected immediately, particularly in terms of staff management and the commitment of investment appropriations."
"On a more general note, I support the rapporteur in all his conclusions, including the need to postpone the decision to grant discharge to the Economic and Social Committee for the 1997 financial year."
"Given the seriousness of the conclusions of the Court of Auditors' annual report on the previous financial year, it is not acceptable that the Economic and Social Committee has considered it inappropriate to refer the matter to UCLAF, as demanded insistently by Parliament, in order to enable the extent of any administrative involvement or responsibility to be fully determined."
"Together with the rapporteur, we welcome the progress made in setting up new budgetary and accounting tools which will ensure greater transparency within the Dublin Foundation."
"We also welcome the signature of a cooperation agreement between this Foundation and the European Agency for Health and Safety in Bilbao in order to prevent needless waste and overlap while developing all possible cooperation."
"In this case, it seems that the combined attention of our rapporteur and the Court of Auditors is finding a real will within the Foundation to respond to the remarks made."
"We are therefore hopeful that the Foundation will endeavour to respond as positively as our rapporteur seems to suggest to the remaining questions and to those which have just been raised on mission expenses and study contracts during the examination of the discharge procedure for the 1997 financial year."
"With regard to Cedefop, we are pleased to hear from the rapporteur that the difficulties connected with the move from Berlin to Thessaloniki seem to have come to an end."
"It goes without saying in this respect that inexperience in a new environment could not justify for very long the failure to comply with normal tendering and selection procedures."
"In any case, we welcome the fact that the generally optimistic conclusions of our rapporteur at the very least allow us to hope that there will be further progress for the next financial year in the management of both the Foundation and Cedefop."
"That concludes voting time."
"The sitting was suspended at 1.30 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m."
"Situation in Kosovo"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Kosovo."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from a humanitarian point of view the situation in Kosovo is still, in our opinion, an out-and-out disaster."
"Estimates of the number of displaced persons within Kosovo are now up to 850 000, according to NATO."
"Interviews with displaced persons by the OSCE's KVM representatives and the United Nations, and also national interviews such as by the German armed forces in the camps, paint a shocking picture of mass executions, rape, plundering and the systematic destruction of Kosovar Albanian houses and property."
"This weekend saw a new round of expulsions on a large scale, particularly from Prizren, where there is a danger of the whole town being expelled under threat of the most horrific acts of violence."
"With regard to the situation in Albania and Macedonia, it is quite obvious that the expulsion of the Kosovar Albanian population by means of the most brutal violence in order to dictate the ethnic and demographic composition of the population of Kosovo is not only a criminal war objective but also pursues a second criminal aim: that of destabilising the neighbouring countries and thus the entire region."
"According to UNHCR figures, a total of 670 000 displaced persons from Kosovo are now in the countries bordering on it; of these approximately 400 000 are now in Albania, 200 000 in Macedonia, and approximately 60 000 in Montenegro."
"On Saturday a further influx of over 10 000 people arrived in Albania and a slightly smaller number arrived in Macedonia."
"Above all, the situation is particularly unstable in political terms."
"Macedonia is a multi-ethnic state in which the composition of the population has direct political consequences."
"EU aid, both bilateral and Community aid, plays an important role in coping with the refugee crisis."
"What is important here is not just material assistance but also the reception of refugees by the Member States."
"We now have such a disastrous situation in Albania and Macedonia that there is no longer any question about whether the people should remain in the region or be taken in by third countries."
"In view of the humanitarian disaster triggered by Milosevic and his inhumane policies, both are needed."
"I would therefore appeal to you, the European Parliament, Members of this House, to call upon your countries either to start taking refugees or to increase their quotas where possible."
"Macedonia in particular needs urgent help here."
"We also have a political interest in ensuring that Macedonia remains stable."
"We must not allow Milosevic's strategy of destabilising neighbouring countries to succeed."
"As for the further political process, we are actively pursuing the strategy of maintaining pressure on Belgrade, pressure that should ensure the implementation of the five point plan which the European Union was the first international organisation to agree, and which was subsequently adopted by NATO and also by the UN Secretary-General as a basis for his own position. These points are: the return of all displaced persons, the return of all refugees, acceptance of an international peace-keeping force to ensure a secure environment for the return of refugees, on the basis of a UN Chapter VII resolution with a NATO core and a high level of NATO participation, but also with the participation of Russia, Ukraine and neutral countries, and the simultaneous withdrawal of military and paramilitary forces and of the special police force of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia."
"This forms the core of what NATO and the Western allies are currently fighting for."
"Any agreement that did not include the return of displaced persons would mean that Milosevic had imposed his will."
"The displaced persons will not return as long as the murderers in the region are still in charge."
"That is absolutely certain."
"For this reason it will be up to an international peace-keeping force to ensure their safe return."
"It is also clear that it is very much in the interest of all the countries bordering on Kosovo, of all neighbouring countries, whether directly or indirectly affected, that lasting stability should be restored in the southern Balkans."
"This is why, in contrast to what we did after Dayton when a cease-fire had already been achieved, we must make urgent preparations for a conference to find solutions in order to achieve a stability pact for the southern Balkans."
"We - the West, the European Union - must use this stability pact to bring this region of Europe closer to our Europe of integration."
"We must not forget that this is a part of Europe that will pose huge security problems for the future of Europe if we do not take this bold step."
"The war in Kosovo makes one thing clear, and here I would like to quote the last speech made by François Mitterrand in this House: nationalism means war, that is Europe's experience."
"The idea of a Europe of integration was formed to fight this nationalist Europe with its dreadful experiences."
"I cannot emphasise this too strongly, and this is why we must give a long-term commitment to bring this region of the southern Balkans closer to our Europe of integration."
"All neighbouring countries, all countries bordering on Kosovo, with the exception of Milosevic, want three things: they want internal democracy, and they want to secure this by means of external security within NATO and by means of economic development within the European Union."
"We must try to meet these expectations by developing a type of stability pact incorporating three elements."
"The most important will be to guarantee the inviolability of borders."
"I would also like at this stage to make a preliminary remark: rather than making abstract academic decisions about where borders should be, who can and cannot live with whom, it is more important that we implement rules - under the rule of law - and reject the rule of violence and weapons."
"These rules must be guaranteed at international level."
"They include the inviolability of borders by means of violence, the guarantee of security and of autonomy for minorities, not only on paper but in reality."
"They also include the security of all states in the region, the same security for all under international guarantee."
"This is the first element: stability and security in the region."
"The second is economic development."
"The first element will be guaranteed principally by NATO, the second by the European Union."
"The third element is democracy, the development of civil society and democratic institutions, and here the OSCE and the United Nations will be called upon."
"In general, therefore, we want to reach a lasting solution after a cease-fire has been achieved; but this means that we are not fighting against Serbia."
"We are not fighting against the legitimate interests of the Serbian people. Instead, what we want, on the basis of democracy and on the basis of the legitimate rights of the Serbian people, is for Serbia to return to Europe and then to develop towards our Europe of integration."
"We consider this to be a long-term solution and a self-evident basis for it."
"In our view Serbia is part of it."
"I say this as someone who, in German domestic politics, particularly in the period 1991-1992, regretted the collapse of Yugoslavia, in which Mr Milosevic played an essential part and considered himself to be a friend of Serbia."
"In my view the tragic thing about this - if we look at it from the point of view of Serbia's history and Serbian interests - is that Milosevic is going to destroy Serbia."
"He will go down in the history of his people as the destroyer of Serbia, and he is only finding out what others in the past found out who put the term 'greater' in front of the name of their nation."
"As soon as nationalism is associated with the term 'greater', it becomes bloody and aggressive, and at this point it generally leads to the self-destruction of the nation if it is allowed to proceed."
"From the point of view of Serbia's legitimate interests, he will be seen as the destroyer of Serbian interests."
"He will not create a Greater Serbia but a rump Serbia, if he is allowed to proceed."
"This is yet another reason why we need to stand up to him."
"The five points formulated by the European Union, NATO and the UN Secretary-General do not mean all-out war against Serbia; instead they allow security and stability for everyone in Kosovo while at the same time guaranteeing security and stability in the region and allowing these to blossom."
"These five points must represent a minimum guarantee."
"They are not five points that endanger Serbia's legitimate interests."
"The political process has taken on new momentum following the NATO summit."
"It is also clear that the notion that NATO - be it only for a limited area, but one that goes beyond Europe - could be an alternative to the United Nations has proved to be a fallacy, as I always believed."
"On the contrary, it is clear that as a regional security organisation NATO is ideally suited to preventing wars in Europe."
"NATO must continue in future to regard this as its primary task, although this must also involve a strengthening of the European pillar, which is something we will have to discuss later."
"The war in Kosovo makes one thing clear to all of us, and I would like here to come back to François Mitterrand, but I could also quote Helmut Kohl, who said: Europe is about war and peace, it is not just about the economy, market regulations and intervention prices, important though all these may be."
"It is ultimately about war and peace."
"Strengthening Europe's individual responsibility will be one of the consequences that we all have to face."
"Applause"
"But at the same time it shows how important it is that Europe and its partners understand the need for closer cooperation."
"Yet this also means that Europe itself must take joint action, and it was difficult enough to enforce the necessary sanctions in the European Union."
"I would like to emphasise this once again, and I am pleased that we have finally succeeded not only in stepping up EU sanctions against Yugoslavia but in upholding the EU oil embargo."
"As I said, the political process took on new momentum after Washington as a result of the strength of the Western alliance."
"Russia has become more involved, which we very much welcome."
"The UN Secretary-General was invited to the special summit of Heads of State and Government, and he too has become increasingly involved, which we also welcome emphatically, and I am delighted to be able to give you the latest news that following yesterday's meeting of the Political Directors of the G8 in Bonn, who were able to agree on a common basis, we will now be holding a G8 ministerial meeting on Kosovo in Bonn on Thursday."
"I see this as an important step towards drafting a Chapter VII resolution in the Security Council, and I would like to take this opportunity to call upon the permanent members of the Security Council to take on an active role in drafting such a resolution."
"Involving Russia means above all that Russia will stop blocking decisions in the Security Council so that we can arrive at a Chapter VII resolution clearly based on international law and a decision of the Security Council as the sole holder of power in the international political system."
"I think that on this basis there will be considerable movement, particularly in Belgrade."
"Many issues remain open."
"The crucial point, I must emphasise once again, is still the international peace-keeping force."
"Any cease-fire solution that does not settle this beyond doubt will not in my opinion be capable of bringing about an actual cease-fire, because the return of refugees must be linked to a robust peace-keeping force with a strong NATO involvement, but also including Russia, neutral countries and others."
"Without this security guarantee the refugees and displaced persons will not return, and the result would be that Milosevic had won and that we would live in a Europe that was no longer our Europe, a Europe which this Parliament - the Parliament of a Europe of integration - really represents."
"This, let me stress once again, was really the crucial point which also caused Rambouillet to fail, and it is the crucial point for future negotiations."
"Once this is settled, of course, everything will then head in the direction of a stability pact, and I have already discussed the rest."
"What we will need here is therefore a strong UN mandate with a substantial NATO component."
"This is absolutely vital."
"I hope that we will be able to achieve a substantial breakthrough in the course of this month."
"I believe that the G8 meeting on Thursday may represent a crucial step forward."
"Applause"
"Mr President, the deportation and ethnic cleansing mean that the exodus continues."
"This crime against humanity requires a determined and unified response."
"We owe that not only to the victims but also to ourselves if we want to stand for a Europe with full respect for basic values."
"We also regret the unintended civilian casualties of the air strikes, but we feel morally obliged to continue to support the objective of stopping the greater evil, that is, the racist policy of Milosevic and those around him."
"We are grateful for the multiple diplomatic efforts by the EU, its presidency, the United States and also Russia."
"We hope Russia will agree with the need for a credible international peacekeeping force in Kosovo within the framework of a political settlement."
"I fully subscribe to what Minister Fischer said about the essence of agreeing to that, while drawing on the lessons learnt in Bosnia and the Kosovo verification mission."
"If that agreement could be reached with Russia, it would considerably increase the pressure on Milosevic, possibly through a United Nations Security Council resolution."
"In the meantime, the Commission remains active in helping to alleviate the consequences of the tragedy by different means."
"Firstly, of course, by humanitarian assistance for the refugees and the international organisations that take care of them."
"At the end of this debate Mrs Bonino will make the necessary comments."
"Furthermore, by assisting the governments of the countries of the region most affected by the massive influx of refugees."
"Also by planning, together with the World Bank, the acceleration of assistance to the neighbouring countries which are bearing a heavy economic burden because of the crisis."
"By preparing for rehabilitation and reconstruction after a political and diplomatic situation has been achieved, which would also include participation by the EU in a temporary administration of Kosovo, pending final definition of its status."
"Last but not least, in trying to prepare for the upgrading of the EU's political and economic relations with all the countries in the western Balkans via stabilisation and association agreements, as an important element and pillar of the stability pact of which the presidency has spoken, aiming at security, democracy and economic development, with, at the same time, the further perspective of joining the European and Euro-Atlantic structures."
"All of this means a comprehensive, massive and costly effort, in addition to the military one borne by our Member States, in order to provide the billions of euros which will be needed to fund all these efforts by the international community."
"The price for a durable and just peace and stability in the Balkans will be high but, at the same time, is imperative both in terms of finance and human resources."
"That is why I take this opportunity, on behalf of the Commission, to call on Parliament and the Council to provide the Commission in due course with the instruments and funds needed to meet our share of this tremendous challenge which we will have to face together."
"We look forward to the discussions in the General Affairs Council, scheduled for the end of this month, to fill in certain elements of these big projects which are aimed at contributing substantially to a more durable and stable western Balkans in the next century."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I have written time and time again to the significant people, that is, the President of the European Parliament, the President of the Commission, NATO and Mr Clinton."
"I have written to Mr Blair asking one very clear question."
"None of them have even acknowledged any of my correspondence."
"My question is: are depleted uranium weapons being used in Kosovo?"
"Are the weapons we are using spreading uranium oxide in that area?"
"Mr Morris, I regret to say that is not a point of order."
"You have every opportunity of participating through your group in the normal way."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, Mr Morris certainly deserves an answer to his question."
"But allow me first of all, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, to express my group's full support for the line you have taken here today."
"My group firmly believes that the United Nations must be involved or brought back into the process."
"I was also very pleased, Mr President-in-Office, to hear the remarks you made concerning the fundamental relationship between NATO and the UN."
"Some people believe that NATO could become the new world or regional police force, and perhaps see a basis for this in the text of NATO's Washington declaration."
"We believe, however, that only the United Nations can play the role of world police and we must do everything we can to reform the United Nations - since reforms are needed - so that it can really play this role well."
"Secondly, as already mentioned, the United Nations must play a crucial role in the peace process that now needs to begin."
"I support you on this point too, Mr President-in-Office."
"It must and can only play this role if it can act effectively."
"For this reason Milosevic's 'offer' to admit an unarmed United Nations force must of course be rejected."
"We have already had the experience of sending armed troops into Bosnia, where Milosevic or certain Serbian troops managed to make the United Nations look ridiculous because they had to stand by and watch massacres taking place."
"We need the United Nations forces to be deployed effectively."
"Furthermore, even in this House some people have said that we could maintain or achieve peace in Europe without Russia, perhaps even if Russia were snubbed."
"This is not possible, nor would it make sense."
"I therefore agree fully with the view which you expressed, Mr President-in-Office, and also the Commissioner. We must bring Russia back on board and we must succeed in persuading Russia to return to a cooperative approach."
"This is absolutely crucial, not just in the Balkans but in general for the peace process in Europe."
"The third point concerns the refugees."
"Winter comes more quickly than we think."
"If the expulsions continue there will be a massive problem."
"I do not know whether everyone is well prepared, whether coordination between the individual institutions functions properly."
"But if we do not want to have another disaster - with the accommodation of refugees next winter - we must do everything you said and we must further improve coordination."
"I am pleased that Germany has increased its quota."
"It may be necessary to further increase the quotas for all countries, although the principle must continue to be to help the refugees in the region if possible."
"However, the burden with which particularly Macedonia (FYROM) and to some extent Albania have to cope should not be disproportionate."
"My final point concerns the regional approach."
"I believe that the regional approach we have been taking is no longer sufficient, and we must find a new one."
"Development in Croatia is linked to that in Bosnia, Bosnia to Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia to Albania, Albania to Macedonia."
"They must all - in my opinion at least - be brought together in a type of Balkan federation, but this can only work if the European Union offers strong political and economic incentives."
"These can only work if Slovenia is also involved, and Slovenia has already requested privileges in its economic relations with these countries."
"Bulgaria and Greece in particular should also be invited to help to implement this regional approach."
"I believe in the regional approach, but ours was too weak, with too few positive incentives for these countries to cooperate."
"This must change, and it must do so in the direction described by the Commissioner."
"Clear support is required from this House."
"Mr President-in-Office, you quoted Mitterrand as saying 'Nationalism is war!'."
"Our reply must be: 'Europe is peace!'."
"Mr President, I have received a letter from your office which states that the question I addressed to the Council, which was to be discussed tomorrow, will not be discussed. The reason given was that today there would be a debate on Kosovo, during which this question, which relates to the environment in Kosovo, which has effectively been destroyed, would be brought up."
"I did not recognise, in the issues dealt with by the honourable President-in-Office, anything vaguely relating to this question."
"Perhaps the questions will be discussed ..."
"The President cut the speaker off"
"Mr Trakatellis, that is not a point of order."
"There is a clearly organised way of participating in debates of this nature. You go through your group the same as every other Member and you get speaking time if you want to participate."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot go into detail on all the issues that concern us in every debate on Kosovo."
"We have been discussing Kosovo constantly in this House since 1989."
"Unlike all the governments, we in this Parliament correctly assessed the explosive nature of the Kosovo conflict from the beginning."
"Now we are having to use military means to solve the problem."
"What annoys me about the whole story is that we are only now talking about economic sanctions and possibly implementing them."
"Surely it is not possible that 15 states could reach agreement on military means before agreeing on sanctions affecting the economy."
"I find this truly regrettable."
"Of course it is also very difficult for our citizens to understand why, with all our military efforts, we have not been able to stop the expulsions carried out by Milosevic."
"It is also regrettable that we too, with our bombing, are killing people in this war."
"Yet we in the European People's Party take the view that NATO must undertake further military attacks in order to make the aggressor give way."
"Time will tell whether this will succeed."
"We welcome all diplomatic measures attempting, alongside the bombing, to bring about a political solution."
"We welcome the fact that Russia is coming on board."
"We welcome all UN measures and we call upon the President-in-Office, following our experiences in Bosnia and in Kosovo, to take steps to finally update the 1949 UN Charter in line with current circumstances."
"Unfortunately, thousands of new refugees are being driven into neighbouring countries every day by Milosevic's henchmen, having been displaced within Kosovo itself, and women are being raped and men executed."
"Assistance for refugees in the region must be much better coordinated than hitherto so that care is not duplicated for some while people in some areas receive no assistance."
"It is important to have well-organised reception facilities for refugees in the region, but unfortunately it will also be necessary for a while to accommodate refugees outside the region."
"I believe that this House should appeal for a fair sharing of the burden in the EU states."
"It is not acceptable that Germany, for example, should once again take in the highest number and is now even preparing to take in more."
"I welcome this of course, but it sends the wrong signal to your colleagues in the other states who are refusing to take in refugees, under the flimsy pretext that it would be better to provide care for them in their own region."
"We are in favour of as much as possible being done in the region, but there are constraints after all, and therefore I appeal to the President-in-Office, along with the German Minister for the Interior, to ensure greater justice and more burden sharing."
"I would like to take this opportunity to point out once again that dividing up Kosovo will not solve this problem."
"The problem can only be solved if Kosovo is preserved and Macedonia and Albania are not further destabilised by it, as Milosevic wishes to do."
"We support everything the President-in-Office said in this context."
"You have our full support if you continue to work towards stabilising the region."
"Mr President, the EU and NATO have agreed on some of the basic requirements for a political solution to the Kosovo crisis."
"The vast majority of the European Parliament has given its wholehearted support to those conditions."
"But there is growing uncertainty about whether the objectives can be achieved by continued bombing alone."
"Those of us who are concerned about this hope that we are wrong."
"But if we accept that neither further bombing nor economic sanctions will produce results, what will the EU and NATO do then?"
"Will we come to accept - possibly on the basis of Russian mediation - a peace which does not fulfil the stated requirements, does not guarantee Kosovo's borders and territorial integrity, does not make it possible for Kosovar refugees and displaced persons to return in safety to Kosovo, and which enables Milosevic to present himself to the Serbs as a victor?"
"What other alternative is there?"
"Well, there is an alternative, namely to force Milosevic out of Kosovo through the deployment of ground troops."
"The Liberals would like to see the EU and NATO preparing for such an action."
"A realistic expectation as to the likelihood of such an action taking place might in itself be sufficient."
"To refuse to even prepare is to give Milosevic hope that there is, or may be, a better alternative for him."
"Let us deprive him of that hope!"
"As regards a long-term solution for Kosovo, we must have a clear answer to the question: to whom do we owe more?"
"Is it to those who have oppressed, driven out, raped and murdered the Kosovar people, or to those who have suffered all of this?"
"For the Liberal Group, the answer to this question is quite clear."
"The requirements which we are entitled to impose on the Kosovars are that they should respect the Serbs who live or would like to live in Kosovo."
"We also have a right to demand that Kosovo never acts in a way which constitutes a threat to the security and territorial integrity of Macedonia, Montenegro or Bosnia."
"Our long-term objective must be - through the rapid development of cooperation with the Balkan countries and an open door to the EU - to achieve in the Balkans what we have achieved in the European Union, namely to safeguard democracy, to build an economy which gives the people prosperity, and to bridge the borders between the countries in a way that diminishes the significance of national identity, so that when it comes to our opportunities in life, it is not so important whether we are German, Portuguese, Greek, Dutch or Swedish."
"Peace and tranquillity in the Balkans is a precondition for entry into Europe, and for the Balkan people too to have the chance to acquire a European identity."
"Mr President, our previous debate on Kosovo on 14 April clarified the positions of the political groups on this tragedy."
"There was a broad and comprehensive condemnation of the criminal practices, referred to as 'ethnic cleansing', for which Mr Milosevic's government is responsible."
"We expressed solidarity with the refugees and confirmed their right to return to their country and the need to ensure that this right was respected through the presence of an international force in a truly autonomous Kosovo."
"Finally, there was also broad agreement on the idea of a conference on the Balkans."
"However, we were opposed to the use of bombing as the means to resolve this terrible crisis."
"Three long weeks have passed since then."
"The humanitarian tragedy which the military intervention was intended to prevent is at its peak."
"The operations which were to be short-lived are increasing day by day."
"The strikes which were intended to hit only strategic targets are killing more and more innocent civilians, traumatising the ordinary people and destroying the economic and cultural foundations of a whole society."
"The destabilisation of the region which NATO's plans were intended to prevent is now becoming a reality in Montenegro, Macedonia and Albania, while concern is increasing in Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and beyond."
"Old splits in Europe which we were trying to close are getting wider before our very eyes."
"Under these conditions, the only military victory possible would risk being a Pyrrhic victory, far removed from the fair and lasting peace we are currently seeking."
"I therefore believe that we must warn the European leaders against two things."
"Firstly, the end cannot justify the means as the one contradicts the other."
"Secondly, the intended objectives must remain the same as those set out at the beginning."
"From this point of view, the serious revelations about the military aspect of Rambouillet are worrying."
"These require clear explanations which I would ask the President-in-Office to provide."
"We should leave Mr Brzezinski and his kind to think that the stakes in this war infinitely exceed Kosovo and actually affect the credibility of NATO and the American leadership."
"On the other hand, we should pay attention to the increasingly numerous, louder and weightier voices in Europe, ranging from Oskar Lafontaine to the 180 members of the Italian Parliament of the Democratic Left-Christian Democrat majority, whose vision of Europe means that, like us, they are also calling for the bombing to stop."
"Opportunities are arising now to begin a process to find political solutions."
"The G8 and the Security Council meeting that Mr Joschka Fischer has just mentioned is perhaps an example of these opportunities."
"I urgently call on Europe to seize these opportunities and face up to its responsibilities."
"With increasing sophistication, Mr President, the ultimate video game of the 21st century is being played in the skies above the Balkans."
"It is a war in the skies which has bombed the people on the ground back into the 1930s."
"On day 40 of the bombing, the idea that a few bombs would bring Milosevic to his knees looks to be a non-starter."
"NATO has lost sight of the proportions involved; the means are no longer proportionate to the end, and too many civilian targets are being hit."
"But I think it is nonsense to say that the United States has dragged us into this venture."
"No member country of the Alliance is being forced to take part: all the NATO partners share the responsibility."
"NATO may lose this war, which would be a disaster for unity within the EU."
"At the same time, however, it is precisely this war which has currently revived the ideal of political unity amongst the greater European family."
"To sum up, the bombing is not achieving its aim."
"To my mind, the EU embargo will not do very much."
"It is a paper tiger."
"Milosevic is playing for time."
"Serbian leaders such as Draskovic and Djindjic are openly looking for the route to the EU."
"We need to be practical in the immediate future."
"We should support the Chernomyrdin initiative, spare Montenegro from the bombing to some extent where possible, preserve the demographic balance in Macedonia by taking in Kosovar refugees in the EU, so that the conflict cannot escalate further in the region, and block arms supplies to the KLA, as Italy has done."
"As for the longer term, the Council President has put forward an ambitious scenario for the region this afternoon, centred on democracy, security and stabilisation."
"The EU will have to play a greater part in this in due course; we have at the very least a moral duty to do that."
"When the bombing and the shooting stops, people will have to go on living together in the Balkans, and it will take well-armed ground forces - and I repeat, because my country has some experience of this - it will take well-armed ground troops to guarantee the peace in Kosovo."
"On the eve of the European elections in June, a particularly difficult task awaits us as parliamentarians. We must prepare our voters for those ground troops to be sent to Kosovo and to remain in the region for a long time."
"But we must do it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently experiencing two wars which do not entirely coincide."
"In one war we have terrible pictures, even if they are mostly only pictures from Serbian television, of destruction, of a war conducted by air and with bombs."
"But there is a second war in Kosovo, and of this we have no pictures."
"We have refugees, deportees, turning up in Albania and Macedonia, but we do not see, we do not know what is happening in Kosovo."
"It is a black hole."
"The problem that we all have is that we want everything at once, in the longstanding tradition of some of our groups."
"We want the war in Kosovo to end immediately, and we want the bombing to stop. But there are some things we do not know."
"We are putting our faith in Russia, which is right."
"We are putting our faith in Kofi Annan, which is right."
"We do not know how we can end these two wars together, in other words how to stop the massacres and the deportation in Kosovo so that the bombing of Serbia can stop."
"The worst thing is the helplessness that we are trying to overcome diplomatically by means of the policy of peace that the EU and by the German Presidency are trying to pursue, a policy that is good."
"How can we put up a struggle for these people, how do we gain the time to end these two wars together?"
"We all have good advice."
"We all know how it should be done, so much so that hardly any Members are present for this debate."
"We MEPs are always the best at giving good moral advice, but when it comes to seriously looking into a problem we have other things to do."
"This is a situation that should certainly give us cause for thought."
"I believe there is no alternative to the military intervention, and I say this because I know how terrible it is."
"But I also believe that we must seize every opportunity to create diplomatic opportunities to bring the war in Kosovo to an end."
"Otherwise, we have to say that there can be no solution that not does not involve allowing refugees and deportees from Kosovo to return to their country, with military support if necessary."
"Mr President, Mr Fischer, I do not believe that we have got there; what is lacking, in my view, is a real political offensive against the Milosevic regime, and there is no action on that front."
"As called for by this House, I think that we have first of all to set about bombarding the Serb people with information and radio and television broadcasts, so that we finally bring home to them the true nature of the Yugoslav regime."
"My second point - and the House finally approved this at its last part-session - is that Milosevic should be indicted as a war criminal."
"We must set about explaining to Mrs Arbour - and this is something the Council should be doing - that if Hitler had not been indicted, on the grounds that it was impossible to establish who had responsibility for any given concentration camp, it would not have been possible to demonstrate the chain of command linking Berlin and Auschwitz."
"That, I think, would have been unacceptable to everyone."
"Today, even though a million people have been deported, there are apparently no grounds for indicting Milosevic."
"That is a complete disgrace."
"I believe that the Council, the Commission and the Parliament should exert increased pressure on Mrs Arbour, who has said that come June she may be sitting on the Canadian supreme court."
"That, I think, is quite unacceptable."
"There is a third point concerning the physical integrity of the dictator Milosevic."
"That is a problem that we must tackle immediately: we cannot wait to see his corpse before we begin discussing what ought to have been done."
"We have to know where Milosevic has been getting his support throughout this whole period; who has been helping him in the United States and Europe; who are the people who have been helping him for ten years, enabling him to prosecute this dreadful and criminal policy first in Bosnia and Croatia and now in Kosovo."
"We have to draw up charges against Milosevic, and so great pressure must be put on Mrs Arbour to persuade her finally to explain what she intends to do at the first opportunity; there has to be a huge information campaign, and Yugoslavia must be brought into Europe, something that we have been calling for for more than 20 years, Mr Fischer, bearing in mind that in 1981 Marco Pannella called in this House for the then Yugoslavia to be integrated into the European Union."
"We must now recover lost ground and integrate all of the countries into the European Union immediately, using an ad hoc formula, but immediately."
"Mr President, everyone is deeply affected by the suffering of the Kosovar Albanians."
"However, we must not hide from the growing disquiet among the public about the systematic bombardment of a European country and its capital and about the growing number of civilian victims our bombs have every day."
"We must not now add to the initial errors of judgement which led to the Rambouillet process being interrupted prematurely, the Security Council being bypassed, Russia being marginalised and the effect of the bombing on the Serbian people being misjudged."
"We therefore believe that the military action and the simplistic propaganda must come to an end as quickly as possible. All our energy must be devoted to returning to the search for a political solution."
"We must not ignore any serious opportunity to do this in order to achieve lasting and therefore realistic solutions which take account of all the causes of the conflict."
"To achieve this stability pact for the Balkans, whose positive prospects you have outlined Mr Fischer, Europe must have the courage to stop the escalation of military action if it is truly concerned about and has a sense of independence."
"Mr President, the offensive currently being conducted against Serbia is quite clearly contrary to international law and is also politically reprehensible."
"It is flouting with impunity the human rights which those who initiated this attack are constantly talking about and it may degenerate to the detriment of European and perhaps world security."
"This offensive is clearly contrary to international law. To start with, conventional international law states that a war can be engaged only after having been declared."
"This was not the case here."
"From now on the United States Government will not show us the archive footage of the Roosevelt speech after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour."
"You must remember the quotation - ' a date which will live in infamy' - and all because the American Secretary of State, who knew perfectly well what was happening, hung about for a few hours in the anteroom of the Japanese Ambassador who had just informed him of the declaration of war."
"His sole purpose in doing this, in American and international public opinion, was to profit from the resulting indignation."
"The American Government is today reserving this indignation for itself."
"There have been many other infamies and many have been committed on the initiative of the US Government."
"This offensive is also clearly contrary to the United Nations Charter which explicitly states that the use of force, except in the case of legitimate defence, is subject to the authorisation of the Security Council."
"This requirement was cast aside with incredible cynicism and in defiance of this basic international law."
"The Security Council's authorisation was not requested because we knew that it would not have been granted."
"This offensive is also contrary to the NATO Charter, that is, the North Atlantic Treaty."
"NATO was a purely defensive alliance to begin with and has been converted for this particular conflict into an offensive alliance which is intervening outside its geographical sphere of action, since Yugoslavia has never fallen within the ambit of NATO."
"These are the violations of the laws involved."
"But political morality is under attack too."
"By encouraging the secession of the Kosovar Albanians, who have not always been innocent themselves of violent acts, we are consequently justifying just what we are condemning and in particular the actions of Milosevic's government."
"If the Albanian claims to Kosovo are founded on the basis of the rights of an ethnic majority, then Milosevic had good grounds in claiming for Serbia the annexation of Croatian Krajina, populated in the main by Serbs, or the annexation of part of Bosnia, also partly populated by Serbs."
"We have to choose one way or the other."
"If ethnic rights are to form the basis, then clearly everyone must have their share of the cake and an international conference will be needed to redefine the borders."
"On the other hand, and this is my opinion, if we insist on respect for the international borders as a fundamental principle of security in international relations, then this principle cannot be just cast aside."
"Finally, in terms of human rights, we are right to feel sorry for the fate of the unfortunate refugees but the number of refugees has increased massively since the intervention and the comprehensive bombing, or if their numbers were as high as was claimed before the NATO intervention, how is it that no plans were made to accommodate them?"
"We are clearly being brainwashed."
"This issue is being dominated by lies and one-sided propaganda, as we have seen in other cases."
"The US Government is really imposing its protectorate on Europe."
"No doubt Mr Clinton is also using this bloody video game to make people forget about the sexual shenanigans in the White House."
"As a man, a politician and an officer, I am ashamed today to be European."
"Mr President, in view of the last speech it is worth reminding this House that ethnic cleansing has gone on in Kosovo for ten years and that refugees were being driven out of their homes long before the NATO bombing."
"It seems to me the worst sort of appeasement to say that if the international community has not acted in one case it should not act in any other."
"I would begin by once again congratulating the President-in-Office for his firmness over this issue of Kosovo and the clarity with which he has led the European Union during his time in office."
"I have been a Member of this Chamber for ten years and we seem to have spent most of those ten years debating events in former Yugoslavia."
"We have had endless resolutions, endless debates, all of which have been trying to hide our helplessness in confronting what was going on in Yugoslavia."
"What we have to be firm on is that we are not going to spend the next ten years debating the same."
"It has to stop now."
"The 10th anniversary of the beginning of it all, with the removal of autonomy from Kosovo, has to be the year in which it finishes."
"Some veterans from the Spanish Civil War were in the public gallery yesterday."
"That reminded me of the slogan of the Spanish Civil War, the defence of Madrid: no pasarán - they shall not pass."
"And that must be the message that comes from this House in this debate and from the European Union."
"Whether they are living in London or Pristina, minorities must not have to live in fear of their lives or fear of random violence which seeks to destroy their homes and their livelihoods."
"We must be absolutely clear on that."
"We must stand firm against the sort of sick minds who feed on fear and hatred of minorities, whether they are planting nail bombs in London or engaging in mass murder in Kosovo."
"There should be absolutely no ambiguity about our message."
"We must not let Milosevic win."
"That means that we must have a proper enforceable peace."
"The Socialist Group has always made it clear that we believe that Russia should be fully involved and I fully support its latest peace mission."
"But we must not mistake a waved piece of paper for a proper peace."
"We have made that mistake in the past."
"There must be no more games from Milosevic."
"There must be an enforceable peace based on an international force which has NATO as its core."
"There should be no retreat from that position whatsoever."
"We must in future learn from what has happened in Bosnia where there is still no peace but only an absence of war."
"We must learn from the mistakes we have made to ensure that we can get effective international cooperation in putting the whole of the region back together again."
"The greatest fear has to be long-term destabilisation, not just in Montenegro, not just in Macedonia, but further abroad, including the effect on Greece and Italy for example."
"There has to be a long-term plan but I would remind the Council that the stability pact was something Parliament called for two years ago."
"I would hope that in light of the Amsterdam Treaty coming into effect, the Council and the Commission start listening a bit more carefully to Parliament."
"On many of the issues about former Yugoslavia we have led the Council and the Commission. So it is time to start listening to us."
"Mr President, the killings and ethnic cleansing are continuing in Kosovo."
"As we know, the operation is a protracted one and has been thoroughly prepared."
"Those ultimately responsible can no longer be negotiated with."
"If we are to apply the classic criteria for a just war, then only the removal of Milosevic's racist dictatorship will do."
"Only then will the means used be proportionate to the improvement of the situation in the Balkans which is to be achieved."
"It will have to be in this way, perhaps with a security pact of the kind the minister referred to, that the conditions are created throughout the Balkans for the rule of law and democracy to be established and for all sources of aggression of the kind currently embodied by the Milosevic regime to be eradicated."
"In the meantime, the states bordering on Yugoslavia - Albania, Macedonia, but also Bulgaria, Romania, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia - must be helped to survive the damage they have suffered through the actions of Serbia."
"They are expected to uphold the boycott and embargoes."
"The EU itself has not suffered much as a result of these, but these other poor countries certainly have done."
"We welcome the financial and macro-economic aid given by the World Bank and the IMF, but the EU will have to change its own economic and trade policy, because humanitarian aid can never make up for the loss of export opportunities and the blocking of transport links with the Union."
"The European Union needs to look very quickly at how far it can provide an alternative market for its friends in the Balkans, and act accordingly."
"In this context, we welcome the proposals to conclude a special kind of association agreement with the two countries most affected, Albania and Macedonia."
"The Union must also offer help in upgrading the communications infrastructure in the countries concerned to create good alternatives to transit through Serbia."
"I should like wholeheartedly to endorse the excellent words of Mr Fischer, because I think we have to send a very clear message here in terms of the Council's attitude."
"Mr President, anyone who visits Belgrade is overcome by feelings of rage and indignation at the destruction and death caused by NATO bombardments. Yet at the same time they are filled with wonder at the strength and courage of the Serbian people and they are moved by the form and content of the demonstrations carried out by the people, who have turned themselves into a human shield in order to protect the bridges of Belgrade."
"Firstly, the fact that logic has been turned on its head by NATO propaganda cannot cover up the crimes against humanity that are being committed in the name of this war."
"This war is aggressive and illegal."
"Secondly, the destruction of the infrastructure of the Yugoslavian economy is an act of genocide."
"Bridges, water, electricity, the basics of human life, are being destroyed."
"The use of the technology of war is a crime against public health and the environment, and is causing an ecological disaster."
"Mr President, there is a just political solution."
"Follow it!"
"You can follow it and provide a real solution."
"Stop this dirty war!"
"Mr President, it is now six weeks since NATO's aerial bombardment of Yugoslavia was begun, with the aim of saving the Kosovo Albanians from the barbaric treatment inflicted on them by the Milosevic regime."
"The outflow of refugees is continuing."
"In Kosovo, hundreds of thousands of Albanians are being held hostage, abused and raped by Serb soldiers."
"In the words of the Albanian writer, Ismaïl Kadaré, in today's Le Monde , the situation is on the point of becoming 'Le triomphe du crime ' - a victory for crime."
"Is it possible to imagine a greater fiasco in terms of a rescue mission, however well-intentioned it was in the beginning?"
"Many people are now beginning to despair, and some are clutching at the idea of using ground troops as a last resort."
"In this case, I think they should read the interview given in Die Zeit by General Eisele, the German UN general, in which he says that it is not simply that this could turn into a long drawn-out war, but that it will drag on for four or five months before the first rescue force is able to intervene in Kosovo."
"One has to understand that military means have their limitations."
"Perhaps it is as the Hungarian writer György Konrád wrote the other day in the Frankfurter Allgemeine , that Europeans have learned from history, but they have learned the wrong things."
"They have learned absolutely nothing from the 1989 lesson in non-violence."
"Dictators fall sooner or later."
"The most effective way is not necessarily to start a war against them."
"Milosevic will also fall - there is no doubt about that."
"There is a Serbian opposition which is making itself visible today in an article in Libération ."
"We must try non-violent methods, we must stop the war, and we must not allow it to result in the militarisation of the EU."
"Instead, let us turn the recommendation on a civil peace corps - as proposed by the Greens and recently approved by Parliament - into a reality."
"That would be a constructive contribution by the EU to establishing peace in Kosovo."
"Mr President, there clearly could be no question of our taking refuge behind conventions of international law or purely formal issues, faced with this terrible tragedy in which the whole population of Kosovo have literally been massacred and uprooted from their country as a result of the appalling ethnic cleansing carried out by the tyrant Milosevic, and NATO has consequently had to intervene - of necessity, though nobody likes it and nobody wanted it."
"The Kosovar people were being massacred and we had to intervene."
"As a civilised society, the European Union could not shirk that obligation or avoid that need."
"In the circumstances, however, we have to point to the inadequacy of the measures taken and the precarious nature of political intervention by the European Union in the past."
"That perhaps is the source of this sense of great bitterness."
"Nonetheless, we must now look to the future and identify the solutions that will bring an end to this war, but it will not end unless an area of security and peace is created in Kosovo."
"I was in Tirana from 21 to 23 April, and I realised there the need to make the presence of the European Parliament felt, as we do not so far appear to have arranged for an official presence in the region, although that would have been the right thing to do."
"I met many political representatives of the government and the opposition: the President of the Parliament, Mr Ginuisynis, the Minister for European Integration, Mr Lakori, who is calling for an association between Albania and the European Union, and the opposition leader, Mr Berisha."
"All of them, both government and opposition, are calling for NATO to put in ground troops, because they understand - and this may be the realistic view - that Albania will not long be able to withstand the pressure, the presence of 350 000 refugees, equivalent to six million refugees arriving in Italy from one day to the next."
"The situation is extremely serious and only armed intervention - unless Milosevic gives way beforehand on the conditions laid down by NATO and the European Union - can in some way relieve the situation and create a safe area, paving the way to the zone of peace and security we have talked about."
"I would also take this opportunity to remind the House that normal conditions of democracy have yet to be established in Albania itself."
"The European Parliament must act immediately to restore the kind of democratic conditions that apply in our countries, because representatives and militants of the opposition party are still in prison and some members of the Albanian Parliament have been deprived of their parliamentary immunity."
"Mr President, let me begin by warmly complimenting the President-in-Office, Mr Fischer, on the speech he has made here this afternoon."
"I think the breadth but also the substance of what he said gives room for hope in a situation which is nevertheless rather sombre, and I hope that he will continue in what remains of the German Presidency to act in accordance with those principles and those ideas, especially in the crisis over Kosovo."
"There is still no solution in sight to the Kosovo conflict."
"Intensive diplomatic activity has not yet produced results."
"But it is important - as others have already said - and welcome that Russia is playing an important part in the diplomacy, and time remains of the essence."
"This conflict must not go on for too long, because the damage done increases with every day that passes."
"Milosevic shows no sign of making the one important concession of allowing peacekeeping troops into Kosovo so as to enable the refugees to return."
"I entirely share Mr Fischer's view that these people, refugees who have been driven out of their country, will need military protection of this kind, on psychological grounds alone."
"Until Milosevic genuinely gives way, there is no reason to stop the NATO action, however welcome such a pause might be."
"I am very concerned about stability in the surrounding countries."
"Public opinion there seems to have little sympathy with the NATO action."
"We know how things stand in Macedonia, but in Bulgaria too, the tension is mounting."
"A lively debate is under way there today in the parliament about whether Bulgarian airspace should be made available for the NATO action."
"People are deeply divided about the NATO bombing in Bulgaria, and the economic effects of the war in Kosovo are becoming increasingly apparent, as Mr Oostlander also mentioned."
"The cost is already put at some 70 million dollars per month."
"We know how poor the country is, and what an enormous cost this is."
"And people do not understand why their poor country should have to meet that cost."
"I would urge the Council and the Commission to look at whether this country too might be given extra economic aid in the short term."
"That would do much for stability in Bulgaria, but would also make the Bulgarians better disposed towards the EU and NATO."
"That good relationship has taken something of a knock."
"Bulgaria cannot wait for a stability pact, a plan for the Balkans, it needs help now."
"But what is true of Bulgaria is also true of other countries in the Balkans."
"NATO is and was prepared to fight for human rights by military means, but the European Union must as soon as possible invest money, know-how and energy in developing the region."
"Otherwise, we can just sit back and wait for the next conflict."
"Today, 4 May, is a day on which the Netherlands commemorates the victims of World War Two."
"Tomorrow we celebrate the liberation."
"The celebrations will be somewhat muted this year."
"And you know why: because today too, in Kosovo and Serbia, people are having to die for the sake of freedom."
"Mr President, I think that in relation to the war in Kosovo, the time has come to turn to reason and for cool-headed reflection."
"Reason is not always convenient - indeed, it is inconvenient - but anyone willing to disregard it does so at his peril."
"Reason would have dictated, for example, that when this whole business started - and perhaps we can say this with hindsight - there would have been an assessment made of the relationship between the political objectives and the political effects of the air strikes and the entirely worthy goal we set ourselves of putting an end to ethnic cleansing."
"Unfortunately, the scenario today is an unpalatable one."
"A perceptive journalist wrote this morning in an Italian newspaper that NATO is in a bad way and Milosevic in a worse one."
"We have arrived at a turning-point in this situation where there has to be a change of tactics."
"Something new is needed, because the air strikes are no longer having an effect: either the attacks continue against the same targets that have been attacked up to now, or attacks are launched on the cities."
"Out-and-out war is not an option, it simply does not exist: above all, the United States Congress will not accept it."
"So what else can we do?"
"Milosevic is in an ugly predicament as well, but he has the backing of his own people's nationalism."
"Now let us be quite clear about this: in the days of fascism, the Italian people were not all anti-fascists either."
"Nationalism did exist, and it was a powerful force."
"Hence the need to take account of it in the current situation."
"What needs to be done?"
"We need to see what cards Milosevic has in his hand, and for that to be achievable, the air strikes have to be suspended."
"The stronger, the more reasonable party must act to suspend the air attacks to let us see what cards each side holds, to get negotiation back on track and to reach a solution to the problem, naturally taking account of the rights of the refugees, guaranteed by a military force, to return to Kosovo."
"Mr President, forty days after NATO violated international law, the consequences are clear."
"The human drama has developed into a disaster, the victims of the hypocritical collateral accidents are increasing, the Rambouillet pretext has disappeared and the autonomy of Kosovo and ethnic rights have not been reestablished. This means that none of the arguments put forward by NATO for this offensive have been validated and none of its initial objectives have been achieved."
"Around the world, and despite its widespread manipulation, public opinion is making itself heard and is calling for UN intervention and a political solution allowing the return of the refugees and respect for the current borders."
"However, the Americans and the subordinate European governments are talking about ground offensives and responding with the so-called 'total war' in which everything is regarded as a strategic target. They are also supporting and rearming a movement which everyone regarded as a terrorist and fundamentalist organisation until recently."
"European integration, the origins of which also lie in war in Europe, as I well remember, is now in a situation where Community institutions are defending and excusing NATO and its armed interventions."
"Meanwhile, this same NATO is altering its strategic basis in order to turn itself into a world police force, without the governments showing any willingness to explain this to the public and without this House being able to discuss this."
"Basically, ladies and gentlemen, this is regrettable and sad."
"Mr President, my message is simply this: speaking of the military dictator, General Pinochet, Allende said that Pinochet had might but not right on his side."
"It may well be that ten years from now, Milosevic's view of us will be that we were right but we lacked the might."
"We have in fact decided to combine might and right, but we took the decision ten years too late."
"Had we in Europe had this discussion on the integration of the Balkans ten years ago, we might not have had on our conscience the 200 000 dead of the war in Bosnia and Milosevic's war against Croatia and so on."
"And we have made a mistake, because in the whole of the argument he puts forward - with which I do not for a moment agree - Mr Gollnisch makes just one point that is true."
"We should have catered for the dreadful tragedy of the exodus and deportation, but at the moment we are floundering in the dark, with no coordination, with a great deal of goodwill, certainly, but with no scientific approach to humanitarian intervention."
"We were slow to react and we failed to react in the right way, and the issue facing us today - and Mr Dupuis said as much - is that we must realise that the time has come to mount a huge information campaign directed at the Serb population, so that they too understand that right and might are on our side and not on the side of Milosevic."
"The Serb people have to believe that too, otherwise our initiative will fail."
"Right and might are on our side then, and I therefore say to you, Mr Fischer, that we can and must be far-sighted in our strategy and more flexible in our tactics."
"If I may make a point which is intended in a friendly and not an antagonistic way, we Europeans are a little more skilful than the Americans in that we take a more far-sighted strategic approach and a more flexible tactical approach."
"So we ought to be able to turn this vision of ours to good account, and then what you said earlier - that 'May could be a month of hope' - could also provide a more reassuring message for our future and, above all, for the future of peace and justice in the Balkans."
"Mr President, I would like particularly to express my warmest thanks to Mr Fischer for his clear words and his clear stance in what is a very difficult situation."
"I should like to look in greater detail at two points which unfortunately were not given much attention in the discussion but are in my view essential."
"We are constantly talking about having to send ground troops into Kosovo."
"This is a reasonable idea in itself, but it is not appropriate for this region."
"We already know from experience - and I am perhaps old enough to have been involved in these experiences - that foreign troops simply do not succeed."
"On the other hand, I have witnessed the liberation of Krajina in Croatia, for example."
"There the Croats had weapons and were able to sweep the Serbs aside immediately."
"It has been proved again and again that people who are defending their own land are superior to the aggressors."
"We must recognise this."
"There is the KLA, there are the Albanian forces, and we must give them weapons so that they can meet the mobs coming out of Serbia on an equal footing."
"We will be astonished at how quickly the ground fighting will come to an end."
"The second point is that at the beginning we made a huge psychological error by repeatedly saying that the Kosovars must remain with Serbia, must remain in Yugoslavia."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we keep forgetting the fact that the state is there for the people, the people are not there for the state."
"So the people should have the right to self-determination, and we should grant this right to the inhabitants of Kosovo, who for decades have undergone indescribable suffering at the hands of the Serbian Government in Belgrade."
"Milosevic is only the product of an old policy that goes back to before the Second World War."
"Mr President, it is clear that the offensive against Yugoslavia has not succeeded in halting the deportations or preventing the exodus of Kosovar Albanians."
"Nor has it made Mr Milosevic relent. But it has succeeded in causing great concern by endangering the whole of the region, and in humiliating the UN and, of course, the political unity of Europe."
"It is clear that this was one of the intentions of American nationalism, while our leaders in Europe connive out of regional fears or aspirations, brushing aside the opportunity to proceed collectively and autonomously."
"Mr President, these offensives will destroy Serbia and will severely harm the Serbian people, killing and wounding many of them."
"Could the presidency give us an account of the victims?"
"It appears that the Kosovar Albanians, together with the Serbs and those living in neighbouring countries, will be the first victims of the pollution caused by the depleted uranium contained in the war-heads that are being used in the region."
"Could the presidency comment on the use of this substance, on the pollution that is envisaged as a result, and on how long this pollution will last?"
"How can the presidency guarantee the return of the refugees to a land that is so polluted?"
"Or perhaps it has already tacitly ruled out the return of the refugees?"
"Mr President, Europe finds itself embroiled in war: a war into which it stumbled without having any real exit strategy; a war with an obvious risk of spreading; a war which it was planned to win in a couple of days, but which after five weeks has not abated; a war which was launched to rescue people suffering ethnic cleansing and which has resulted in a million refugees; a war which has turned resistance to Milosevic into support for him."
"It is time to ask ourselves whether it was a good way to attain our objective."
"Ethnic cleansing and injustice can never be tolerated."
"It is time to put an end to Milosevic's reign of terror, but it is also time to put an end to the NATO bombing."
"It is time to put forward a political solution to what is a political problem."
"As a former prime minister of Sweden, Olof Palme, once said: 'One cannot establish democracy by bombing the villages one should be preserving'."
"The EU has political, diplomatic and economic means at its disposal, and it should make use of them in the Balkans."
"It is time for the EU to make an active contribution to establishing the right conditions for a political solution to the war in Kosovo."
"It is time for the UN to resume its rightful role and for the EU to call for a UN peacekeeping force in Kosovo, so that the refugees can return in safety."
"The EU countries should draw up a large-scale Marshall plan for the Balkan region, to rebuild the devastated communities and to counteract the hatred, which will otherwise provide a breeding-ground for future conflicts for generations to come."
"The war has taught us that the EU needs to develop without delay an instrument for conflict resolution, peacekeeping, mediation, reconciliation and confidence building."
"If we cannot find methods for resolving conflicts peacefully, without being forced to use military means, then the whole idea behind the EU will crumble away."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can certainly endorse much of what has been said here this afternoon, but by no means all of it."
"Who among us is not following these events with growing concern?"
"Have we not for years defended human rights in every sitting here in the European Parliament?"
"I will do the same here today for the last time."
"We have been fairly vocal in defending human rights, sometimes for small groups of people."
"Here we are concerned with hundreds of thousands of people whose rights are being repeatedly violated - I do not need to give all the details again here - and this is happening in a part of Europe that was formerly very popular among tourists."
"In my view there are two very different aspects to the NATO response."
"For the first time a regional alliance of nations is emerging to defend these people's human rights, to restore stability to a part of Europe that has for eight years seen one set of violations lead to another, and always for the same reasons."
"The UN, however, failed completely as it was not able to apply either its Charter or international law in practice; instead, a lot of what it said remained merely empty words, and it did not manage to prevent the conflicts for which it was actually created."
"Anyone who lived through the Second World War, as I did, knows what it is like to experience bombs and see burning houses and victims of war at close quarters."
"We would not wish it on anyone, and certainly not on the Serbian people and Serbian children whose leader's madness has driven them to ruin in the same way as it has hundreds of thousands of others."
"No one has anything against the Serbian people."
"Each one of us would protect Serbian children in the same way as we would Kosovar or Albanian children."
"We must at long last speak out to condemn this madness."
"We must realise that we cannot only summon the UN when we need it."
"Parliament will make every effort to ensure that this region is rebuilt when the time comes, and I also see this commitment in Emma Bonino, in Mr van den Broek and in others with whom we have worked for a long time."
"Every opportunity for negotiation must be used, but only when the madness has been ended and we really can provide these people with a home, protection and peace."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, I will spare you the high-flown sentiments and I also hope to spare you any naivety."
"Faced with the monstrous nature of the crime committed by Milosevic, which is already ethnocide and may also be genocide, I agree with those who firmly believe that we had to do something."
"I support the majority in this Parliament which has warmly approved the military intervention."
"Similarly, I do not believe for one moment that Mr Milosevic's brutal nature could allow him to be receptive to a measure such as a unilateral halt to our action in order to restart political talks."
"I feel it is dangerous even to consider this."
"However, the result of our action is worrying."
"Serbia is certainly being weakened, but not really Milosevic."
"The ethnic cleansing in Kosovo is getting worse."
"Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro have become weaker and the prospects are not good."
"Now that this war has been started, we must win it."
"I am not going to talk about the future."
"Many opinions have been expressed here today, some of which I agree with, but not all."
"What interests me is 'how'."
"Minister, Mr President-in-Office, how was this offensive prepared?"
"Was the European Union, or at least the Member States involved, consulted about the plan of attack?"
"Did the EU comment on the chances of success of this plan and on the existence or otherwise of any other plan?"
"Did the Council you are presiding over discuss the option of supplementing the air strikes with a ground offensive, which anyone can see is essential strategically?"
"Did the Council of Ministers at that point seek to develop the means to establish a common strategic debate so that the elements of this action specific to Europe could be proposed to the Alliance Council?"
"And finally Mr Fischer, at this point in time, can you tell us if the Council is aware of the urgent need to develop within the Alliance a capacity for analysis and defence specific to Europe?"
"Mr President, for too long the international community has allowed Milosevic to do as he pleases, without trying all possible sanctions such as an oil embargo."
"Even in the early 1990s we heard reports of the use of mass rape as a weapon of war in Croatia and in the war in Bosnia."
"Today we are once again hearing from international aid organisations that women are being deliberately picked out of groups of refugees and dragged off by force, to be returned next morning half dead and highly traumatised or never to be seen again."
"This violence against women, this wave of torture and rape motivated by nationalism, intensifies the spiral of violence, hatred and revenge that is destroying all hope of a peaceful multi-ethnic Kosovo."
"Women are falling victim to war criminals because they are women, and the EU must recognise this as grounds for asylum."
"In my view, however, it is the height of cynicism that in this situation the Vatican allows women to use contraception but labels abortion as murder."
"Some of our Heads of State and Government and, Mr Fischer, your colleagues should blush with shame when we see where refugees have been taken in and where they have not."
"Four EU Member States have not taken in any refugees."
"The Union must increase humanitarian aid and immediately review the NATO strategy."
"We must stop the bombing and we must, with Russian involvement, return to the negotiating table with a negotiating position."
"Mr President, I should like to devote my speaking time to an aspect which is relevant to the work of my committee, namely refugee policy."
"Mrs Gröner spoke of this earlier."
"But calling it a policy is going a little too far."
"Of the more than 600 000 Kosovars who have fled and been driven out of house and home, fewer than 18 000 have so far been taken in by the Member States of the Union."
"Of these, Germany has taken nearly 10 000, which means that the rest of the Member States between them have not yet managed even 8 000 Kosovars."
"Just imagine, in the space of a few weeks in the poorest areas in Europe, 600 000 people have had to be housed in camps, and even private homes as well."
"That figure of 600 000 is twice the number of people that we in our wealthy countries consider each year for asylum, because asylum seekers number only 300 000 or so a year."
"We all share the responsibility for this flood of refugees."
"In the course of the last few weeks, out of solidarity and humanity, we should have devised a policy for absorbing these refugees and dividing them up fairly between the Member States."
"I see it as proof of the Council's impotence that it was unable to take a decision of that kind, and to some extent I see this as a refusal to put your money where your mouth is."
"At any rate, this House must galvanise the Council into action."
"The problem of refugees and human misery cannot be solved by throwing ECU 250 million at it."
"What we want to see is a temporary haven for substantial numbers of them in our Member States, together with every possible material assistance to the countries in the region, not least after the crisis is over."
"Mr President, this is I think the second or third time we have discussed this issue."
"Let me begin with you, Mr Rocard."
"I do not know what level of information the Member States of the Union or those who sit on the North Atlantic Council have."
"What I can say is that, at a humanitarian level at least, the Commission, like all the humanitarian agencies, was not given information by those Member States which belong to both the European Union and the North Atlantic Council."
"No one was briefed or informed of any plans or given any information."
"I actually believe that, from the humanitarian point of view, the problem is one of coordination."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is right and proper that individuals, including the individual Member States, should be generous, but this does make coordination more or less impossible."
"It is very difficult, even for the UNHCR, successfully to organise hundreds of NGOs, funded by private donations, as well as the structures of the 15 Member States that have quite rightly been spurred into action, besides the other donors from the United States, together with the Canadians, the Norwegians, the Japanese and so on. It is, I can assure you, easy to talk about the role of coordination, but more difficult to carry it out, and one reason for this is that, understandably, everyone feels the need for a visible political presence, and we can all agree on that."
"In the final analysis, there is clearly some divergence of interests."
"How then are we to avoid duplicating aid when practically no one knows what the Member States are doing?"
"How can we avoid the kind of mistakes that arise when generosity is not matched by experience?"
"It is, for example, difficult to inform, warn or prevent someone from setting up camps where they are not able to be maintained because, in the rush, nobody consults."
"What I am trying to convey to you here is that there has not to this day been any limitation on funding or on humanitarian projects."
"There has been a serious lack of coordination, of discipline, and a failure to set priorities."
"And so it seems to me that the task of the UNHCR - our task therefore - is not of the easiest."
"A second question that has been put to me, and this is something on which we are working, is the more important issue of providing shelter."
"It is true that what we mostly see are the camps with their dreadful conditions, but honourable Members should realise that the great majority of the deportees have been taken in by extremely poor Albanian or Macedonian families, as we all know, and that one of the major efforts we are making is to provide aid to those families, specifically to prevent social tensions and to ensure that the refugees do not find themselves on the street after enjoying a month's generous hospitality, thereby creating social problems."
"Another activity in which we are very much involved is, more particularly, preparing for the worst-case scenario, namely the advent of winter."
"For some of the refugees at least, we are restoring brick-built housing and community centres to enable us to evacuate as soon as possible the vast majority of deportees who are living under canvas and to provide them with more acceptable health and sanitary conditions, or at least better climatic conditions."
"I must also draw your attention to three other risk factors that have to be borne in mind: the first is Macedonia, because of the political problem there."
"However, although I appreciate the political problem which the Macedonian Government has, I do not think its attitude to the deportees at the frontier is acceptable - and nor would it be acceptable in any circumstances."
"While I understand its difficulties, it is not acceptable that anyone should violate the humanitarian conventions."
"The second issue is that of Montenegro."
"The House should not forget that there are in Montenegro 70 000 deportees who are human time bombs."
"These are not the kind of refugees we are used to, they are actually deportees, human time bombs to be used if, when and where Milosevic so decides."
"And if he decides to dispatch a human time bomb made up of a hundred thousand people against Montenegro, we will really see a problem of political destabilisation."
"Another point that we should keep in mind concerns Bosnia, which was already in a difficult situation and has taken in 50 000 refugees, in this case Serbs."
"The third issue on which we are working relates to the Serb evacuees on Serbian territory, for whom we have made provision by taking specific measures."
"I shall be returning to the region in the next few days, but I would ask for your help in conveying this message: the crucial element now in humanitarian aid is to set priorities and to be disciplined and coordinated; failing that, I am afraid that, despite the great generosity coming from all sides, the result will be total disarray."
"There are two further, perhaps rather more political points that I would make."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that when our forebears opted for the European Community, they did so for two reasons: that there should never again be war between us, and that there should never be another Auschwitz."
"Today we have to choose between those two eventualities, because it has not been possible to rule out both."
"We hear the call for a political solution."
"But what have we been doing with Milosevic over the past ten years if not seeking a political solution?"
"In my humble opinion, we have gone too far: from one conference to the next, from one diplomatic meeting to the next, from one meeting in Geneva to the next."
"But I would venture to say better late than never."
"It probably is late - too late, I agree - but just think of the case-file from Osiek to Vukovar, Srebrenica to Sarajevo, Bihac to Tuzla and so many other shameful crimes, to which we failed to respond."
"We simply cannot say that since we do not intervene everywhere, we should not intervene in our own backyard either."
"I think it is quite clear where the responsibilities lie here, at least as regards the European Union, for resolving not so much problems far afield as those in our own backyard."
"If we do not even have the courage for that, if we believe that Europe means having a single currency, a bit of agriculture and - why not? - a spot of fishing, but do not share these principles, and by that I mean the rejection of ethnic cleansing in Europe at least, then it becomes meaningless to call ourselves Europeans."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pick up where Commissioner Bonino left off."
"If we look at the debate - and in this respect it resembles all the other debates we have heard in recent weeks - we can see that there are a lot of good individual arguments that we have all thought of from time to time."
"But if we try to find an alternative way of looking at things we find that we have not heard an alternative. a political solution has been called for."
"Yes, but a political solution is not an end in itself."
"The question should be: what must a political solution achieve? a political solution must achieve an end to violence."
"Applause"
"a political solution must bring about the return of those who have been displaced and it must in particular ensure that we do not have another ten years of nationalist madness in the Balkans with hundreds of thousands of more deaths."
"Applause"
"a political solution is not an end in itself, so we must talk about the substance of our policy."
"The only thing I can add there is to offer Mr Milosevic a peace corps. He would like that."
"He would immediately support that, particularly now."
"And why?"
"Because then he would have what he wanted."
"Mr Milosevic is not the man to be influenced by a peace corps."
"I am very strongly in favour of a peace corps, I am very much in favour of a Europe in which violence has no place."
"But how are we to respond to someone who has used the most merciless violence not just once, not twice, not three times, but for ten years?"
"Applause"
"In my view this is not just a moral issue."
"It is a question of European security and of the future of Europe."
"I would accept the criticism if we had acted rashly in resorting to force, but there are at least 200 000 people lying in mass graves because we acted too late."
"Think of Bosnia!"
"Are our memories so short?"
"Mr Karadzic was in Geneva and signed treaties that just an hour later were no longer valid in Bosnia."
"This did not happen once, or ten times, it happened umpteen times."
"What must it take?"
"This is a question we must ask ourselves."
"Of course we all ask ourselves this question constantly - I can at least say this for the German Government, but surely all the governments involved feel the same - when it is our responsibility."
"But some statements I have heard have confused cause and effect."
"Applause"
"We must not confuse cause and effect here!"
"The cause is Milosevic's policy."
"He is not a nationalist but a cynic."
"His aim is to obtain power."
"This is why he is using the aggressive tactics of Serb nationalism."
"He has unleashed the tiger and is trying to ride it, and if we allow him to continue he will not only bring disaster to an entire region of Europe, but he will also cost more innocent lives."
"The brutal expulsion and exodus we are now witnessing are on a scale that we would not have thought possible."
"Emma Bonino rightly said that these are human bombs, in other words the expulsion is being used doubly cynically as brutal tactics against neighbouring countries."
"Europe cannot accept this. a political solution that involved accepting this would be completely wrong."
"It would be the opposite of what we want."
"Applause"
"We are trying to implement a political solution that uses force on the basis of respect for human rights, common security and the return of all refugees, on the basis of the international community."
"This is the type of political solution we are trying to achieve."
"But this presupposes firstly that Belgrade is left in no doubt about the resolve of the international community, and secondly that it understands that a military solution holds no prospects for Serbia and also none for Milosevic personally."
"I consider it imperative that we achieve a political solution and a cease-fire on this basis."
"I consider it to be not only necessary but crucial that we develop proposals that can be discussed or considered and that have a clear content that can be implemented."
"On the other hand, it must be clear that cause and effect cannot be confused, and I would like to emphasise this."
"Milosevic is responsible for this war, which I hope will be the last round of violence."
"If we do not put a halt to his actions Montenegro will follow, then Sandjak will follow, then Vojvodina and then sooner or later we will have the same war again in a new round, this time in Macedonia."
"I have no doubts on this score."
"Therefore, of all the good arguments I have heard, the only possible alternative is a political solution that renounces the use of force, respects human rights and ensures the return of refugees."
"Belgrade must take this on board."
"Milosevic must take this step."
"Applause"
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m."
"CFSP"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report (A4-0242/99) by Mr Spencer, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the role of the Union in the world: implementation of the common foreign and security policy for 1998; -the report (A4-0219/99) by Mr Spencer, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, containing a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the common strategy towards the Russian Federation; -the statement by the Council on the appointment of the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy."
"Mr President, I hope that the President-in-Office is going to announce the decision to appoint the High Representative at the Council meeting in Cologne."
"Under our Rules of Procedure we will invite the successful candidate to speak to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy on 21 June so that we may put a recommendation of approval to the July plenary."
"We take the view that the High Representative must be a figure of substance, not a creature of Council in-fighting."
"The relationship which the successful candidate forms with Parliament and the Commission is, in our view, central to the coherence of foreign policy."
"The year 1998 was the year when our hopes of coherence in foreign policy were tested by reality."
"The last twelve months have seen the establishment of the euro and we deserve a foreign policy that matches the expectations in the rest of the world raised by our new monetary union."
"1998 was the year of the pregnancy of our new foreign policy structures under the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"We deserve a foreign policy structure that provides the telephone number that Henry Kissinger asked for a generation ago."
"1998 was the year in which we first engaged with the reality of Europe's defence."
"We deserve a foreign policy that is backed by clarity and coherence in our defence structure, most particularly as regards the Western European Union."
"My report details the use of the Union's instruments around the world."
"It is a story familiar from recent years; a story of imperfect institutions struggling to grapple with an unstable world."
"We want to see a strong High Representative, a strong policy planning and early warning unit, a strong Commission structure with a coherent team of Commissioners dealing with external relations."
"We want a CFSP that is adequately financed, that is academically and intellectually credible, using to the full the successful crisis prevention network."
"Europe is a power in the world."
"It must find a common voice; a common voice for use not just in our near abroad."
"Our embarrassed silences on Iran, Iraq or the Indian sub-continent are products of black spots in our vision, reflecting fifty years of building Europe brick by domestic brick rather than according to a global vision of our place in the world of diplomacy."
"Our foreign policy has human rights and dignity at its core."
"How could it be otherwise with our own shared heritage of horror and civil war?"
"Painful though it may be to contemplate, there is no other explanation for a Union that is prepared to wage war, not for oil, not for power, but to oppose the evil of ethnic cleansing in the heart of Europe."
"Of all the instruments at our disposal the common strategies should be the most powerful."
"From the highest level they are supposed to guide Europe's footsteps in the world."
"Rightly we set out to define our relationship with Russia, our neighbour in the common European house, as a first step."
"To forge a new instrument in the heat of a crisis with our most important neighbour is perhaps excessively courageous."
"I am not convinced that the text that the Council is currently considering is yet good enough."
"To prepare it in a hurry without the help of the High Representative and without either the reality or the structure of consultation with Parliament is, in my view, hubris."
"It is the folly of the magic circle of national diplomats in Brussels who continue to believe that yesterday's working methods are adequate for tomorrow's challenges."
"Far from seeking to send a negative message to Moscow by proposing in paragraph 4 that the Council delay the adoption of the common strategy until the Helsinki Summit, we were seeking to ensure that the urgent did not drive out the important."
"It is exactly because we want a strong document that we offered the suggestion of delay."
"I accept however that there are those in Russia, outside the government, who are not committed to a positive relationship and who might deliberately misinterpret our motives."
"I am therefore happy to recommend to the House the adoption of Amendment No 2 from the Socialist Group."
"War shines a harsh light on all our evasions, on all our half-truths, on all our institutional improvisations."
"Europe and our relations with Russia and with America will not be the same after the war."
"If that harsh light challenges us to define our views of the world, it does the same for America."
"My report has severe things to say about the conduct of American foreign policy, not least its co-option by commercial interests."
"Washington, it seems to me, is currently torn between a view of itself as the centre of a unipolar world of American hegemony and the more realistic recognition that it is a super-power that operates most effectively when it exercises its power in tandem with Europe."
"Nowhere, Mr President, are the new realities more apparent than in the Balkans."
"It is in the Balkans that Europe will be tested in the next five years."
"It is central to our relationship with Russia, it is central to NATO's credibility, it is central to Europe's role inside NATO."
"In recent weeks I have twice been in Europe's south-east."
"And beyond the horror of stories from the refugee camps I retain a clear sense of the suspicion with which our activities are viewed in the Balkans."
"This suspicion is not just the product of an understandable fear of proximity to war with a dangerous and unpredictable local bully."
"It is not only a justifiable fear about the economic consequences of a war which isolates and disrupts."
"It is a deeper fear of betrayal and deceit from the West."
"I believe passionately that we need a coherent European initiative in the Balkans using all our instruments."
"I cheerfully admit to rechristening the Centre for European Policy Studies' proposals 'the Prodi plan', a plan for reconstruction, openness, development and integration with Europe."
"I salute Professor Prodi's foresight in saying weeks ago that Europe's relations with the Balkans should be seen as part of the enlargement of the Union, rather than as foreign policy."
"But to succeed, such a plan will require a sea change in our mutual relations."
"We must stop seeing the Balkans as the repository of all that we are most frightened of in ourselves."
"They must learn to trust the Union and to trust themselves as fully European."
"Much is made of the difference of the Balkans and particularly of the differences of religious heritage with the Orthodox Church."
"We have to make a real effort to understand our joint destiny as Europeans."
"It is a commonplace of European rhetoric that we are formed by our inheritance from Greece and Rome."
"But it is an accident of Western European educational history that we define this in terms of Ancient Greece and Imperial Rome."
"The western intellectual tradition often forgets that there were two Romes."
"We forget at our peril that Constantinople was, for centuries, the original European city of culture when the ancestors of today's Council of Ministers were camping in the ruins of a former glory."
"Surely the time has now come to declare Diocletian's division of the empire redundant and to accept that Sofia, Skopje and Sarajevo, that Budapest, Bucharest and Belgrade are all heir to the same civilisation."
"If an apology needs to be made about Western Europe's behaviour in the Crusades, it should relate not to the conquest of Jerusalem, but to the sacking of Constantinople by Frankish knights."
"The lack of trust in Western Europe goes that far back into our history and it urgently needs to be remedied."
"The Danube in my view must become a symbol of our unity rather than a blocked artery in the body of Europe."
"I commend to this House, and to the President-in-Office, the initiative of His All Holiness the Patriarch of Constantinople in mounting the religion, science and environment symposium in September, in which representatives of all five of the great religions of the region - Orthodox and Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Muslim will sail from Regensberg to the Black Sea in the interests both of environment and of reconciliation."
"There is a role here, both for Pope and Patriarch."
"The war with Serbia must be the last of Europe's civil wars."
"The cocktail of religious bigotry and nationalism must be put aside on the Danube, as it was 50 years ago on the Rhine."
"These weeks, however dangerous, are rich with possibility."
"This is the moment when Europe grows up in its external relations."
"These are the weeks when we have to accept that Europe's role requires responsibilities as well as rhetoric, that we are charged with the difficult, as well as the detailed."
"These are the weeks when we have to learn to be ourselves, rather than merely an element in other people's strategy."
"These are the weeks when we assert that we are Europe, all of Europe."
"Mr President, I commend my reports to the House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what progress has been made in the four months of the German Presidency and the four months since the introduction of the euro?"
"Four days ago the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force."
"Of course it will not bring about a revolution, but it does represent an important step along the path to greater integration, politics for the people and democracy."
"We should therefore not make light of the Treaty."
"It strengthens the role of Parliament in particular within the European institutions, and this is a crucial step forward."
"It also gives the Union the opportunity to make its common foreign and security policy more efficient, coherent and effective by improving its foreign policy instruments."
"The German Presidency has therefore made every effort to ensure that the Treaty can be applied in full from the first day."
"We must now use the new instruments for the common foreign and security policy as extensively as possible, beginning by defining a comprehensive and coherent policy towards our neighbouring regions."
"This is the aim of the common strategies."
"The first of these will concern Russia, and further strategies concerning the Ukraine, the western Balkans and the Mediterranean region will follow as soon as possible."
"In recent months we have been able to reach a considerable degree of agreement on the substance and structure of our strategy on Russia."
"I am therefore confident and take a different view from the previous speaker, because although I fully understand some of your arguments, particularly concerning the procedure and the interests of the committee and of Parliament, in the present circumstances postponing this strategy on Russia would have a negative knock-on effect."
"So I can only advise against postponing the strategy until the Helsinki summit, particularly in the current situation."
"Bear in mind that this is not just about Kosovo but Russia's overall economic and social instability."
"Europe's change of direction towards Russia is of crucial importance, and I would add that this also applies to our strategy on Ukraine, where I believe we are dealing with a similar problem."
"For this reason I am confident that the strategy can be adopted in Cologne."
"The aim of the Russia strategy is to help to promote democracy and the rule of law and to integrate this important neighbour into the European Economic and Social Area; it is also to strengthen relations in general and to establish a basis for future relations."
"The Kosovo crisis shows only too clearly how urgently we need Russia's constructive cooperation for peace in Europe."
"One of the West's priority tasks is to ensure that the barbaric war in Kosovo does not also lead to any sort of reversal in our relations with Russia, but that we continue to build on our partnership."
"Our close cooperation with Moscow in the search for a political solution in Kosovo shows that Russia takes the same view."
"Russia must become a close partner of the new Europe, and we must devote all our energies to working towards this."
"The experience gained through the Russia strategy must subsequently be put to use as quickly as possible in working out the other strategies."
"It is important that in doing so we ensure a careful balance between the regions, as stability to the south is just as important for Europe as stability to the east."
"As President-in-Office of the Council I would add that in the six months that I have been Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Federal Republic of Germany and, since 1 January, President of the European Council, one point has become absolutely clear: European foreign policy can no longer look to the East or to the South; these are both areas of conflict, problem areas which affect us equally, whether it is the south-east, the southern Balkans with the Kosovo war and the crisis that must be resolved there, whether it is the Mediterranean Conference in Stuttgart, where we suddenly found ourselves physically in the middle of the Middle East conflict, with the Israelis to the right and the Palestinians to the left - we were suddenly in the midst of a negotiation process and we succeeded in keeping both sides in the conference, which was not a foregone conclusion from what we expected and in view of the political situation, particularly with the elections in Israel - or whether it is the current negotiations with Russia or with Ukraine."
"All of this shows clearly that Europe's foreign policy must be based on a European approach and must not pit the east against the south."
"This offers zero prospects and would simply set Europe back."
"We have therefore placed an important emphasis on the south with the third Mediterranean Conference in Stuttgart, particularly with the successful agreement on the basic components of the forward-looking Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Peace and Stability."
"Europe's defence of the Kosovars' rights is a significant signal for the coexistence of Christians and Muslims in our future world, as it shows that Europeans form a community of values that goes beyond religion."
"Mr Spencer, you dealt with this aspect in great detail in your speech."
"It is also very important, in the current difficult phase of the Middle East peace process, that Europeans should continue to pull in the same direction and that they spoke with one voice in the Middle East declaration of the Heads of State and Government on 25 March."
"The Oslo interim agreement expires today."
"We welcome the Palestinians' wise decision to take no unilateral action and we hope that serious negotiations can be resumed as soon as possible."
"During the German Presidency the EU's relations with other regions of the world have been accorded considerable importance."
"The Berlin ASEAN meeting further strengthened dialogue and cooperation with our Asian partners."
"We are hoping that the first Europe - Latin America summit to be held in Rio de Janeiro will improve our political, economic and cultural relations."
"The EU-US summit in Cologne should also give strong impetus to the future of the transatlantic partnership and at the same time bring current areas of conflict, such as bananas, hormone-treated meat, hushkits and other, at least onto a constructive course leading to a solution."
"The High Representative for the CFSP, provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam, is to be appointed at the Cologne European Council."
"The German Presidency believes that this should be a man or woman who carries considerable political weight and is able to assert himself or herself."
"He or she must be given a powerful role in order to be able to promote a European foreign policy that is as operational as possible and to serve as a point of progression in foreign policy but also in domestic relations."
"The High Representative should therefore ideally play an active role as adviser in internal consensus-building."
"A further important topic in this six-month period is European security and defence policy."
"The Kosovo conflict has illustrated once again that the collaboration and presence of the USA remain indispensable for the defence of our fundamental values of peace, human rights and democracy in Europe."
"However, the USA's predominance in both the military and political handling of the Kosovo conflict has also shown how urgent it is that we in Europe strengthen our ability to act in foreign and security policy if we ourselves are to be capable of effective crisis management in future."
"Tony Blair's initiative in Pörtschach and the Franco-British meeting in St Malo have provided us with a good model, and it has been a vital concern of the German Presidency to use this new dynamism."
"We secured the unreserved support of NATO at its Washington summit for the development of the European security and defence policy."
"The importance of future partnership between the EU and NATO also became clear here."
"The presidency is preparing a report for the European Council in Cologne which will establish the basic consensus that is emerging for the guidelines we presented and a decision on the integration of the WEU into the EU in accordance with Article 17 of the EU Treaty, including a target date in the foreseeable future."
"If we were to reach agreement on this the conditions would be in place for Europe to take unified action."
"In my statement of 12 January I highlighted the prospects for the further development of European integration, and I would like to do this today for the CFSP."
"I would like to emphasise four points."
"Firstly, the European Union, as a global political actor, must take account of the increased importance of human rights through a committed human rights policy."
"For the first time, therefore, on a German-British initiative it is to draw up its own human rights report this year, which should increase the transparency of EU human rights policy and deal with both subject-related and country-related issues."
"For Europe it has been a fundamental experience to discover how important the work of human rights groups was in the former Warsaw Pact area and how crucial Part 3 of the Helsinki Agreement was for the end of Communist dictatorship in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe."
"This parallel nature of political dialogue, economic openness and defence of human rights is a legacy for Europe that must inform its human rights policy in other regions of the world too."
"In this respect we must tirelessly continue to support democrats and human rights proponents wherever they are oppressed."
"For this reason the EU clearly expressed its criticism of the human rights situation in China to the Geneva-based Commission on Human Rights on several occasions, most recently in the EU declaration on the Chinese no-action motion."
"We condemn in particular the action taken against political dissidents, for example the imposition of the death penalty on a scale unprecedented in international terms, and the treatment of minorities, especially in Tibet."
"The EU strongly urges the Chinese Government to ensure progress in the human rights situation in practice, with respect for democracy and the rule of law."
"The EU must also, within its own borders, show greater support for the observance of human rights."
"Human rights, democracy and the rule of law are stated clearly in the Treaty of Amsterdam as conditions of membership, and if they are not observed membership rights may be restricted."
"We hope that the EU will lay the foundations at the European Council in Cologne for the drafting of a European charter of fundamental rights to reinforce the rights of its citizens."
"Such a charter could later become a constitutive element of a European constitution."
"Enshrining civil rights may also serve as a model in the enlargement of the Union."
"Secondly, the EU must offer the states of south-eastern Europe a political and economic perspective that goes beyond the Kosovo crisis, a far-sighted vision and all-embracing concept for peace and integration."
"The stability pact for south-eastern Europe was roundly welcomed in the previous debate."
"Thirdly, we also want to achieve the following. The greater the Union's ability to act, particularly in the CFSP, the greater the democratic control and legitimacy of European policy must be."
"The German Presidency therefore wants to include the extension of the European Parliament's rights on the agenda for the next intergovernmental conference on institutional reform, for which we intend to draw up a timetable in Cologne in June."
"Fourthly, in the long term we will only be able to strengthen the common foreign and security policy by presenting a united front in the G8, in international financial institutions and particularly in the United Nations, and by extending the use of majority voting."
"Yet in the forthcoming phase the common foreign and security policy is not concerned with further institutional reform but with maximising joint action and the intensive application of the new instruments."
"We must learn increasingly to change our thought patterns and to place our national interests after the greater interests of Europe."
"During the German Presidency we have succeeded in maintaining or even increasing the EU's unity and ability to act in many difficult foreign policy issues in relation to Kosovo, China, the Middle East and many other areas."
"This is a success for all of us, and we must continue down this road."
"We must succeed in the next few years in realising a Europe that is capable of political action, as it is only in this way that the European Union will be able to defend its interests and values adequately in the multipolar world of the 21st century."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by taking the opportunity of wishing Mr Spencer well in the future and expressing the hope that his considerable abilities can be put to good use."
"It has certainly been interesting working with him for the last two and a half years, if only because I never knew what he would be getting up to next."
"To return to the debate, I have to say that there have been times in the last few years when I have felt that the initials CFSP have not stood for common foreign and security policy but for coreless, fudge and sclerotic posturing."
"There has been a lack of direction and decision quite frequently."
"Some of that is understandable: we are operating in the most sensitive area of national sovereignty; it has been difficult to bring together nation states with different interests and practices and clearly we have had to walk before we could run."
"As Mr Spencer said, if we can achieve the euro, we ought to be able to achieve a genuine foreign and security policy."
"Certainly Kosovo has shown the inadequateness of our response and we need to use that as an example to spur us on further."
"We have been, in many ways, guilty of complacency: we say often that the justification of the European Union is to get rid of wars within Europe's borders and forget what is happening just outside Europe's borders and our responsibility for that."
"Clearly we must change."
"The policy planning unit is going to be very important, but it must link in with other organisations, like the conflict prevention network, which Parliament was instrumental in setting up."
"We need coherent long-term thinking that will allow foreign policy issues to run through both pillar 1 and pillar 2 issues."
"I should like to see us focus on the longer-term strategic questions, such as the role of water supply in conflict prevention."
"Obviously the High Representative will be very important but what is crucial is that this appointment should not be a fudge and that we appoint somebody who we know can do the job and whom the Council is prepared to allow to do the job."
"That High Representative must work with the other institutions, the Commission and Parliament."
"Indeed, I would like to see these institutions working much closer together throughout the CFSP."
"As I said in the previous debate, in particular I should like to see the Council listening more to Parliament."
"We have put together some coherent and important positions, particularly in our recommendations."
"We should like to believe that the Council is listening and responding to them."
"Parliament, for its part, must stop demanding the impossible."
"We cannot take action in every area of the world: we have to prioritise."
"There can be no morality without practicality."
"We must remember the greatest contribution we can make to peace and stability is the enlargement of the European Union."
"That should be our main focus in the next parliament."
"Clearly we also need a European defence identity but we should remember that the fifteen Member States spend two-thirds of what the Americans spend on equipment and yet we have a fraction of the equipment they use."
"We must have more coordination on not only defence policy but also defence procurement and we must look to restructure our defence industries."
"We must have military thinking which reflects the new realities, as has happened in the United Kingdom with the defence review."
"We must have clarification of the position of the WEU and the role it is going to take in the European defence identity, and that must happen in Cologne."
"Finally, we must consider whether or not we need to increase defence expenditure if we are to meet our ambitions for the CFSP."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Spencer on his excellent report and to say that this report comes at a very important moment in the history of the European Union."
"At least three crises - those of Kosovo, Russia and the Middle East - demonstrate that the superpower that is Europe could have handled these issues much better."
"The Spencer report goes some way to answering the major question that is tormenting all of us: 'why did this happen?'"
"This is both a conceptual and an institutional undertaking, which does not stop with the establishment of institutions, or the appointment of 'foreign policy' representatives."
"It is an issue relating to the conditions under which the foreign policy representatives, or those mediators who are appointed by the European Union, will work."
"Mr President-in-Office, I address you in the light of the Council summit meeting in Cologne, and I say to you that, in Cologne, you will have in your hands a historic opportunity to establish the conditions and the prerequisites to enable the new Intergovernmental Conference to do for foreign policy what the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam did for the economy; a European foreign policy which, as you more than anyone else are aware of because of your background, cannot stop at diplomatic processes, but must contain answers to challenges such as the economy, the environment and culture."
"Mr President, as the previous speaker said, our annual debate on the Union's role in the world is taking place at a special point in time."
"A war is raging in Europe, a war with military input from the Member States. And a few days ago, the Amsterdam Treaty entered into force."
"That may perhaps give a new impetus to foreign policy."
"So I shall not concentrate so much on looking back at our common policy over the past year, but will try to look forward."
"One of the biggest changes in foreign policy will be the new instrument of common strategies."
"At first sight, the plan does not look all that remarkable, but it is a first step towards real majority voting in this area in the Council."
"The effect of this majority decision making will be to reduce the power of national parliaments, and that must be counterbalanced by an increase in influence for the European Parliament."
"Only Union actions which draw their democratic legitimacy from the common foreign and security policy will be able to count on support from the people of Europe."
"For these reasons, a future High Representative will need to appear before Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy to seek its endorsement."
"Only in this way, I believe, can a close link be forged between this representative and the European Parliament."
"A word or two now on Europe's identity in the field of security."
"The current war in Kosovo has shown once again the desperate need for the EU to have its own capability for military crisis management, as so often advocated in this House."
"In this area too, the Union must be able to act more independently of the USA if need be."
"So the WEU really must be merged into the Union without further delay."
"Finally, Mr President, this is my last speech to the House on a report, and I am especially pleased that it is a report by my friend and colleague Tom Spencer."
"My thanks to him for the leadership he has sought to give, and has given, to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"My compliments and good wishes."
"Mr President, we are living in difficult times in Europe."
"The Social Democrats and Greens in Germany, which holds the Presidency of the Council, are bombing the Yugoslavians, that is to say, the Slavs, with no formal declaration of war."
"There are still more Slavs in Russia."
"In the prevailing circumstances, Mr Spencer's report is well-balanced and carefully thought out, serving the cause of peace and cooperation, and serving also to maintain talks among the parties involved."
"It touches on some issues that have been largely overlooked."
"It is by no means self-evident that Russia must be helped."
"The EUR 400 million in food aid granted by the EU is a big mistake, as it is counterproductive and destroying markets."
"In addition, no decision has been taken on the basis on which debts are to be waived, and it what way this should be dealt with."
"The IMF is not rescuing Russia, but American and German banks, and it is therefore responsible for yet more disorder in Russia."
"Its country's central bank cannot receive currency loans; its own reserves are located in Jersey."
"Thus I welcome Mr Spencer's report, as it avoids setting out the sort of political conditions that Parliament usually does, but approaches the issue in a balanced way."
"Mr President, I should like to welcome the President-in-Office. Ladies and gentlemen, reconciliation with Russia is the most crucial peace strategy for our continent."
"In this respect the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia without a UN mandate represents the most criminal violation of this principle."
"The Western community has cast aside the peace principle in view of the massive human rights violations and ethnic expulsions in Kosovo."
"However, in my opinion it is a mistake whose consequences will set us back for a long time in our attempt to develop a common security strategy in Europe."
"The end never justifies the means as the results for our continent cannot yet be predicted."
"I would like to touch on a few of these."
"Firstly, every bomb makes the return to the negotiating table more difficult."
"I see only one way out: Russia must be given an increasingly central role in the political solution."
"Attempts have been made, but Russia's offers to negotiate have to date been rejected and in the end it has not been given this role after all."
"Secondly, the Washington option of taking military action without a UN mandate and against international practice forces Russia to define its own zones of influence and to assert its right to do the same here."
"We need think only of the many conflicts in North Caucasia and Transcaucasia and the dangers that have re-emerged there too."
"Thirdly, the ABM Treaty and the ratification of START 2 are likely to be indefinitely postponed, and with them goes our desire for worldwide disarmament which ties up so many financial and material resources."
"Therefore it is important that we develop a common strategy, and that we do so as the first act under the new opportunities offered by a common foreign and security policy."
"But it must not be used as an alibi."
"I would also say that unless there is interinstitutional change in terms of involving the European Parliament's democratic right of control, then we will have less power of influence over foreign policy than we have had up to now."
"This is why we need interinstitutional change."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank Mr Spencer for his report and also in general for his work in committee."
"As I come from a town on the Danube I would like to thank him for his statement today and for emphasising the importance of this strip of Europe that has very often been an area of crisis and war but could also be an area of peace and cooperation, linking western and central Europe with the Balkans and also with Russia, Ukraine and finally also Turkey, as he mentioned."
"It is on the one hand a positive sign for Europe that the crises and political conflicts are not inside but on the edge of the European Union."
"But this is no cause for satisfaction, as we need to devote extra-special attention to achieving peace on our borders."
"The President-in-Office was the first in today's debate to ask what has happened to the political solutions. I would like to ask the further question: where were the crisis prevention measures in recent years?"
"Crisis prevention is not a miracle weapon, if I can use the term 'weapon' here."
"But bombs are not a miracle weapon either!"
"Nor are ground troops, as we know."
"We must bear all these instruments in mind, but if we are building a common foreign and security policy here I would urge that we begin primarily where we should begin, which is with crisis prevention."
"This is an important task which we must bear in mind particularly in the near future, and to which this Parliament must also contribute accordingly."
"One final comment, again about the work done by Mr Spencer over the last few years."
"Being an enthusiastic parliamentarian he has often brought us into confrontation with the Commission and the Council, whether we wanted to or not."
"What is important is that he lent weight to Parliament and its Members."
"I would ask the Commission and the Council to take note of the fact that we parliamentarians are capable of more than simply holding debates such as these, which are not always very interesting or exciting, and that the Council and the Commission should in future involve Parliament more in the drafting and also in the implementation of policy."
"Then the policies of the European Union are sure to be even more efficient than they will be under the new High Representative."
"Mr President, the shameful war in Yugoslavia and the cataclysmic turmoil in the Balkans lend dramatic currency to the report by Mr Spencer."
"With composure our rapporteur has attempted to elaborate a strategy for our relations with the former world super power, Russia, and he has succeeded."
"However, in my opinion it is essential that, in the pain and confusion that surrounds us, we send a clear message and that we acknowledge the role that Russia can and must play without delay in order to avert the visible dangers: the military entanglements; the broader destabilisation of the region; the revival of cold-war rivalries."
"Unfortunately, however, while the relentless bombardments continue, disinformation on both sides is rife and self-criticism is in short supply."
"Even the call for a political solution, which Kofi Annan sought following his meeting with President Yeltsin, is scoffed at by those who fear that the military credibility of NATO will be compromised and that the Clinton policy on Kosovo will be discredited, if logic is brought to bear on self-sustaining acts of stupidity."
"The stance taken by Mr Prodi this morning, and what the President-in-Office has said just now concerning the importance that the Russian Federation will have in the immediate future for the success of the major policies of the European Union, such as enlargement and the CFSP, are encouraging."
"However, we must not wait for the new President to assume his or her duties before we call for immediate and feasible solutions to the explosive problems of today."
"Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy considered two very important and closely related reports at the same time."
"One was by Mrs Piha, on the Union's northern dimension, and the other was Mr Spencer's report on the Union's strategy with respect to Russia."
"The committee was unable to create a link between the two reports, since the one on the strategy with respect to Russia only mentions the northern dimension in passing."
"The report on the northern dimension declines, for its part, to take a position on Russia, as that was seen to be more relevant to the report on Russia."
"The northern dimension must be seen as an essential part of both the EU's external relations and the decision-making process that impacts on its internal development."
"In external relations the northern dimension will be responsible for the creation of a separate common strategy, in which relations with Russia will have a key position."
"In developing the Russian strategy further the aim will be for the instruments already available to the Union, and especially the TACIS programme, to effectively implement jointly established goals."
"In its EU policy, Russia must also be able to broaden its pan-European network of contacts."
"The EU has to develop its institutions so that it can broaden its scope to cover the whole of Europe."
"This will require internal differentiation on the part of the Union, and its development as a confederation of states, rather than as a federation."
"The Union, in principle, must also be open to Russian membership, although this seems a long way off at present."
"The Liberal Group approves the report on the strategy with respect to Russia as it stands, but we wish to remove the proposal to postpone decisions on it."
"The strategy must be put into effect without delay, and its implementation has to get under way in as effective a way as possible."
"My congratulations go to Mr Spencer for an excellent report."
"Mr President, the Russian Federation is struggling with enormous social, economic and political problems."
"The standard of living of its people has continued to fall, insecurity and the influence of various mafias have increased alarmingly and the country is heading towards disintegration."
"For these reasons and also because we must continue to improve our relations with Russia in light of the serious crisis in Kosovo, we support the decision taken on 26 April by the Council to adopt a proposal for a common strategy towards Russia."
"This common strategy sets out the need for democracy, the rule of law in public institutions and the integration of Russia into a European social and economic area as well as the common challenges which are facing the European continent."
"However, it will be necessary to improve the judicial system, the public administration, the police forces and the regional authorities through training, support for reforms, the reinforcement of relations between the European and Russian political systems and support for the NGOs and for an independent press."
"On a social and economic level, there are various areas of action: restructuring businesses, public finances, the banking system or access to international financial markets, standards and certification, competition policy, access to the market, cooperation on technology and the development of agricultural reform and social dialogue."
"The reforms of the PHARE and TACIS programmes should be aimed at making the best use of the impetus for cooperation with European business sectors."
"In terms of stability and security, joint initiatives must be proposed to Russia on foreign policy, through contacts made by the High Representative for the CFSP, and on increasing Russian participation when the EU uses the Western European Union for operations commonly known as 'Petersberg tasks'. Also, joint initiatives are needed to strengthen cooperation in order to prevent and resolve conflicts within the OSCE and United Nations and also in respect of disarmament control."
"Other challenges include the protection of the environment, nuclear safety and the fight against organised crime through regional or transborder actions."
"We feel that a stable, democratic and prosperous Russia, firmly anchored in a united Europe, is essential for ensuring lasting peace on the European continent."
"Our support for the current and future democratically elected Russian authorities must continue."
"We also believe that this common strategy towards Russia must be adopted at the next meeting of the European Council in Cologne."
"We will therefore vote in favour of this and will not support any postponement."
"Thank you, Mr President. I very much welcome the fact that the Council firstly wants to adopt a common strategy with Russia."
"According to the Treaty of Amsterdam a common strategy requires the consultation of the European Parliament."
"In view of Parliament's schedule the Council feels that consultation is not possible if the common strategy is to be decided at the June summit, as the final draft of the document will not be available until 17 May."
"It is therefore particularly important that we make it clear to the Council that the procedure of a report with recommendations to the Council on a common strategy is a one-off solution because of the elections."
"In all future common strategies Parliament will insist on being consulted by the Council."
"I should like to look at a few issues of substance, although it is difficult to make recommendations about a text that we do not have before us."
"I would like to emphasise one point in particular: I would oppose the rapporteur's endeavours to postpone the common strategy on our relations with Russia, which is of the utmost importance at this present juncture, as the strategy goes far beyond bilateral relations with this country."
"Both the Member States and the Commission have stated clearly that any delay in adopting the strategy could be misinterpreted by the Russians, and I believe that it is in all our interests to avoid any increase in tension between the European Union and Russia in the current complicated international situation."
"Russia's efforts to solve the conflict in the Balkans serve only to further underline the importance of this country for Europe's security structure, and I very much support the President-in-Office's desire to adopt this strategy as quickly as possible."
"The European Union's policy towards the Russian Federation has not always been exemplary to date, but I would hope that the combination of a comprehensive strategy and the new TACIS regulation that is due to enter into force in the year 2000 will lead to a significant improvement in decision-making and implementation in the European Union's policy on Russia."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to endorse what Mrs Krehl said."
"I too consider it to be a mistake to postpone the issue of our relations with Russia and what form the strategy should take."
"I believe in fact that, particularly in view of current events, it is absolutely essential that we not only maintain the line of communication with Moscow but develop it further."
"It has been said several times today in the various debates that without Russia a European security structure and a flourishing Europe would be inconceivable."
"It is also the case that on visits to Russia and in talks with Russian colleagues we are repeatedly asked about the European Union's strategy towards Russia."
"In fact - at least this is the impression I get - this strategy has up to now been inadequate."
"We have had the partnership agreement, but what should come after that and how it should be developed are questions that have so far not been given sufficient attention."
"I believe these questions must be answered so that we can tackle the issue methodically and in accordance with our objectives."
"When we are in Moscow our Russian partners often end up by asking whether we can imagine Russia perhaps one day even becoming a member of the European Union."
"I always reply that I cannot imagine it today but that I cannot say whether I might be able to imagine it in 30, 40 or 50 years' time."
"Our strategy need not go this far but I believe that at least the framework conditions for the development of this thriving cooperation must certainly be established immediately so that the Russians also know where they stand."
"In addition, the work from the partnership agreement must also be developed further, of course."
"Russia itself continues to have a great many serious problems."
"I can only say that it is also our duty as the European Union and as a party in negotiation with them to do our best to make it easier for them to tackle and resolve many of these home-made problems."
"Wherever we can lend support we should do so."
"Mr President, it is highly significant that the whole foreign policy discussion has centred around Russia."
"Russia is indeed the most important problem in our foreign policy."
"But this has been the case for a long time in our history."
"Unfortunately, I sometimes have the impression that many of our leading politicians who talk about this have not read history or, if they have read it, have not understood it."
"We need a realistic relationship with Russia that should not be determined by fear but a policy that knows what the facts are and takes them on board."
"Enrico Berlinguer once made a very true comment, which was that we should take what the Russians tell us seriously."
"We do not take it seriously."
"We have not taken on board that this is an imperialistic power with whom we have to coexist, but we must recognise that it is an imperialistic power and that attempts to make the poacher turn gamekeeper, as it were, sometimes go astray."
"We must pursue a realistic policy that is based to a large extent on the fact that Russia today, at a time of worldwide decolonisation, is the last great colonial empire on earth."
"Russia will join Europe one day, but I am convinced that this will only be possible when it has been decolonised, since we do not want to be dragged into any new colonial wars with the countries of the Far East, which is a very real danger."
"Anyone who has dealt with China - and I would hope that our politicians will devote more attention to China - knows what its plans are."
"China is a power that also has commitments in Siberia; every day 5 000 Chinese cross the Amur border illegally. These are the things we need to think about."
"I am grateful to Mr Spencer for his report; I would only ask that we keep to the situation in reality."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that the CFSP must be strengthened, particularly in the areas of early warning, conflict prevention and the development of the European security and defence identity."
"The recent Washington Summit and the future Cologne Council have further focused attention on how we can promote human rights and secure peace in Europe in the next millennium."
"Ever closer partnership with the Russian Federation will be essential to achieve these aims."
"May I say at this point that the central conclusion of Mr Spencer's report on Russia, namely that we must postpone agreement on a common strategy beyond the Cologne Summit in June, is - and I think many agree here - diplomatic lunacy."
"What sort of signal would this give Russia at a time when we look to Moscow to play a positive role in assisting with peace talks on Kosovo."
"Such a delay in fostering closer political and economic ties with Russia would merely be a gift to anti-western, communist and nationalist forces in Russia, as has been mentioned during the debate."
"But the rapporteur is correct in calling for the common strategy to have real substance and the means for implementing it."
"The economic, environmental and social situation in Russia is dire, but Russia must also do more to help itself by reforming the economy and banking sector, collecting taxes and overhauling the legal system."
"The European Union and international financial institutions should play their part in assisting an effective reform programme."
"But there must be political will on the Russian side to eliminate the 'robber baron' style of capitalism which has developed since 1991."
"With the resurgence of nationalism in Russia and the growing social deprivation of the majority of the Russian people, it is both our duty and in our interest for Europe to work with Russia to enhance democracy, security and prosperity for all our citizens."
"Mr President, 1 May was the day on which the Amsterdam Treaty and the common foreign and security policy became a reality."
"It is my belief that if we had had this foreign policy in place several years ago, we would not have experienced the crises in Bosnia and Croatia - far less the war in Serbia."
"The prevention of crises is, as our colleagues have mentioned, extremely important."
"I therefore believe that we should be careful not to put the cart before the horse, talking more about technical options such as bombs and armed conflict than about crisis resolution."
"So I say: crisis prevention first, military hardware second."
"It is vitally important that we achieve agreement as far as the analysis is concerned, and that those in charge of the common foreign and security policy cooperate closely with the Member States."
"The new institution, 'Mr or Mrs Foreign Policy, ' should be primarily preventative and cooperate with the OSCE, the UN and so on. It may be regrettable that it did not succeed in the Balkans and that intervention was necessary, but that is something we must be prepared for when human rights are so grossly violated."
"Mr President, it is good that the issues of the northern dimension are seen in the report as being an essential part of policy on Russia."
"The northern dimension, however, should have been accorded greater substance, such as the creation of free trade zones for northwestern Russia, which would help it to develop."
"However, the report talks about an economic and social crisis as if that were the heart of the matter."
"It is merely the result of a political crisis. That is the core issue."
"That is why the world's richest country, in terms of natural resources, has become poverty-stricken."
"First and foremost, Russia needs a credible, stable political system."
"Shameless, large-scale corruption on the part of politicians and dubious businessmen has destroyed the credibility of the administration in the eyes of its own nation."
"Furthermore, loans from the west have been transferred to private tax havens, which must not be tolerated."
"Prime Minister Primakov has vowed to address the problem of fraud."
"We are waiting for the Russian Government to ask Interpol for help in sorting out accounts and finance."
"Loans from western financial institutions must be made conditional on the eradication of corruption at high levels."
"Besides, it does not cost anything, or at least no extra loans are required."
"In fact, corruption rots the whole system from top to bottom, and it stifles many of the reforms."
"That is a lot more important than adhering to every detail in the budget."
"The report also rather passes over the fact that the nation has descended into poverty because a small elite has been clinging onto the nation's wealth."
"This has had the unfortunate result that life expectancy has fallen by ten years in ten years."
"We need a strategy that will tackle the essential issues."
"In addition, the banking system and the criminal chains associated with it must be changed, reformed and straightened out."
"We should nevertheless bear in mind that Russia has an educated population and a splendid culture which will challenge the individualism and materialism of the west."
"Mr President, I should like to comment on the review of foreign policy presented by Mr Spencer, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"I feel that this review underlines the extent to which the Union's foreign interests depend on its internal strength and are closely linked to it. It is not enough therefore for us to wring our hands and regret that we have not yet consolidated our common foreign and security policy."
"Instead, we need to use all the means at our disposal to ensure that this foreign and security policy - and also our defence policy - is in line with our interests and responsibilities."
"I should like to draw attention to two important considerations. The first relates to the speech made by Mr Fischer, the President-in-Office of the Council."
"We are entering a new stage that will be characterised by the Council's appointment of the High Representative for the CFSP. Only this morning we heard Mr Prodi, the President-designate of the Commission, talk about reorganising the Commission and suggest that it would be useful to appoint Vice-Presidents and restructure departments."
"In my view, we need to do more than simply appoint a High Representative for the CFSP."
"As things stand at the moment in the Commission, five Commissioners are involved with issues of this nature and rationalisation would certainly be helpful. It should also be borne in mind that we need to move forwards towards a defence policy."
"Personally, I am very much in favour of integrating the WEU into the European Union. Such a common defence policy would enable us to cope with the challenges we are currently faced with."
"Mr President, first of all my thanks to Mr Spencer for his balanced report, which rounds off what has been for him, I believe, a successful parliamentary term."
"I wish to take this opportunity of offering my personal thanks to him in particular, and to all the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for the very intensive and for me extremely stimulating discussions I have been privileged to have with the committee during the past term."
"I should like to look both back a little and forward a little."
"Back, because I note that since I became Dutch foreign minister in 1982 - when we were still talking at European level about European Political Cooperation, although the Tindemans report was already eight years old and gave an extremely visionary description of the kind of common foreign and security policy a Union would need - since that time, since the Tindemans report and in the course of the last 15 to 17 years, quite a lot has been achieved in this respect."
"I say that because we tend to allow our achievements in the area of common external policy to be overshadowed by what we have failed to achieve, with Bosnia and the Bosnia issue probably marking the low point as regards the lack of effectiveness on the part of what is now the European Union."
"Before I come to the points of criticism, let me recapitulate - not in detail, but just a quick tour."
"Mention has been made of it today, and the project of the enlargement of the European Union is certainly a major undertaking, or will be so, but it is also a serious step in terms of preparing the foreign policy of the European Union."
"The same can be said of the contractual and therefore structural ties, including political dialogues, which we have developed with Russia, Ukraine and in fact with all the countries of the former Soviet Union."
"I am thinking of the broader and deeper transatlantic ties which the Union has developed."
"I am thinking of the Barcelona process."
"I am thinking too of the broad consensus which has evolved over the years on the very sensitive issue of Middle Eastern policy."
"And, last but not least, I am thinking of the policy and ties we have developed with so many countries in the third world, developing countries, as part of the ACP process."
"As I said, I shall not go into detail, but all these things are positive achievements."
"Where we have underperformed is in the area of crisis management."
"I think we are all agreed on one thing."
"We have not really had enough instruments for preventing and resolving crises."
"The Kosovo crisis on the one hand and the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty on the other, which gives us a number of new instruments which may further improve our capacity for crisis management, are two events which to my mind represent a dramatic coinciding of circumstances."
"We were far too late in reacting to Kosovo because, while we had no warning of Bosnia, we could have seen Kosovo coming."
"At the same time, though, we did not wait for countless people to die in Kosovo before collectively resorting to the ultimate weapon in an attempt to stop the barbarities happening in the Balkans."
"We did not wait until more than 200 000 people had died, as we did in Bosnia; after one and a half years of intense diplomacy, using all our resources to try to reach a political solution by these traditional means, including economic sanctions, we did not shrink in the end from collectively using the ultimate instrument of military force in an effort to bring Milosevic to his senses, difficult though that choice was."
"The new instruments of the Amsterdam Treaty can never replace the political will of the Member States, of course."
"But I think there is some cause for optimism and, saddened as we are by the tragedy of Kosovo, Kosovo has given a boost to the political will of the Member States to make a collective stand against reprehensible political actions in our continent."
"I hope that this trend will be reinforced by the appointment of the High Representative, by the creation of a planning and early warning unit, and by the instrument of common strategies now being deployed."
"As an outgoing Commissioner, I would venture to say - and not because the Council President has now left - that according to my interpretation of the Amsterdam Treaty, the devising of a common strategy, with all the opportunities for action which this affords the Union, is something that warrants prior discussion with Parliament."
"As I understand the text, Parliament has to be consulted on the truly fundamental issues of foreign policy, and on matters of implementation it must also be regularly briefed and kept informed."
"In the course of the last parliamentary term, I have done my best to further that process."
"I am very much in favour of the common strategy towards Russia, which the President-in-Office mentioned."
"It would be sending out entirely the wrong signal - certainly in the present circumstances - if we sought for whatever reason to put off finalising that common strategy on Russia."
"I hope the Heads of Government will reach agreement on that in Cologne."
"And I would add the express hope that the newly elected Parliament - because this Parliament has now run its course - will be prepared in the context of this common strategy towards Russia to give a measure of priority to the very important instrument we need in order to carry out that action, namely the new TACIS regulation."
"The Amsterdam Treaty also offers us the chance to move closer towards an integrated foreign policy combining political, economic and financial instruments with military instruments as well, in a new troika made up of the presidency, the High Representative and a Vice-President - rather than five Commissioners - and presenting a new face of continuity, visibility and as a result, to my mind, greater effectiveness too in the European Union's foreign policy."
"Also partly as a result of Kosovo, the pace of the debate on a European security and defence identity is steadily quickening."
"There are interesting echoes of this in the Washington communiqué following the events to commemorate 50 years of NATO."
"Clear progress has been achieved here."
"I agree with Mr Titley that a common foreign and security policy is not really feasible unless we also have closer cooperation in the defence industry."
"This is a subject which has been raised many a time in this House, and I have the feeling that while some progress has been achieved among the Member States, you would like to see more."
"If the Commission can do more to help - once again, I should say, because in the past it has already done so two or three times in a number of communications - I am confident that the new Commission will be more than happy to do that."
"I will leave it there, Mr President."
"Once again, my compliments to Mr Tom Spencer on his report and my thanks to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, but also to the other honourable Members with whom I have been privileged to hold such thorough-going debates over the last parliamentary term on matters of foreign and security policy generally, though I am mindful too of the role which Parliament has played over this past term in promoting policy on human rights."
"Parliament's voice is one which, it is fair to say, is heard by a very wide audience around the world."
"I hope the new Parliament will make that voice heard more loudly and more often, because the tragedy currently unfolding in the Balkans is proof enough that there can never be too many words of warning and incitements to action, not least on the part of a democratically elected forum like the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I am aware of the bad parliamentary habit of writing one's speeches in advance and then making them without listening to the rest of the debate."
"Indeed I have even been guilty of that myself on occasion."
"So could I say very gently to Mr Truscott and other colleagues that if they had listened to my speech at the beginning, by accepting Amendment No 2 on the Russian recommendation - which is a Socialist Group amendment - it deletes the reference to 'delay' in the adoption of the common strategy with Russia and replaces it with what I feel is a very valid statement of what that recommendation should contain."
"I want to make it absolutely clear to the House that I am completely comfortable with my report on the recommendation as I trust it will be amended tomorrow."
"As I am on my feet I should like to thank colleagues for their overly generous remarks towards me."
"I return the compliment to the Commissioner."
"Commissioner van den Broek comes from a country with a powerful parliamentary tradition which he has embodied."
"He did the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy of Parliament the courtesy of engaging in intelligent debate."
"It is that intelligent debate which is the lifeblood of properly formulated foreign policy."
"I hope that in the next and all future Parliaments the Council will learn from his example."
"The High Representatives may be part of the mouthpiece of the Council but it is good debate between all three institutions which holds out the best hope for the future."
"Thank you very much indeed, Commissioner."
"Mr President, I did indeed listen to Mr Spencer's speech from my office."
"I would like to congratulate him for his U-turn on Russia during the course of the debate."
"I am glad to see that Mr Spencer is upholding the fine traditions of ideological inconsistency which we see all too often in the Conservative Party in Britain today."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Statute for MEPs"
"The next item is the report (A4-0267/99) by Mr Rothley, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the draft European Parliament Decision regarding a Statute for Members of the European Parliament (7528/2/99 - C4-0217/99-00/0823(COS))."
"I give the floor to the rapporteur, Mr Rothley."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 3 December the European Parliament adopted by a qualified majority a draft Statute that was moderate, balanced, clearly reasonable, simple and practical and certainly also had a certain intellectual charm."
"By a qualified majority!"
"To date we have not had any response from the Council to the draft."
"The Council can accept or reject it, but if it rejects it it must give its reasons so that we can verify whether they are legitimate."
"Instead the Council has put forward its own draft which is not acceptable to Parliament."
"For example, it has established a permanent inequality by giving Member States the right to subject the incomes of Members of Parliament to national taxation."
"The three Scandinavian Member States and the United Kingdom have now made use of this option, and France may do the same."
"It may no longer be on the agenda for the German Presidency, however, as it can no longer approve it."
"Now we not only have the new draft from the Council, but attempts are also being made in this House to adopt a different text tomorrow, with a motion from the Liberal Group."
"How politically stupid does one have to be to change a text that Parliament has adopted by a qualified majority before we have even negotiated with the Council on it?"
"The Council will probably say: if we wait for another three or four months Parliament might adopt another new text and another one again another three months after that."
"I have to say that the potential for self-destruction in this Parliament is enormous!"
"Every new text is simply weakening Parliament's position."
"Furthermore, how can you expect your colleagues to vote on a constitution that is supposed to solve all their existential problems without having had the chance to discuss them in committee and without the groups even having had the chance to discuss them!"
"Do you expect us to be able to vote on such a text?"
"That is ridiculous."
"Mr Wijsenbeek, we discussed my original text in this House very thoroughly and in great detail, and the result was a qualified majority."
"This was a huge step forward, and now you want to turn it around!"
"I do not know what your reasons are, but they are not very important."
"The European Parliament should not decide on a constitutional text in haste."
"And Parliament would be well advised only to adopt such a text if there is a broad consensus on it in the House."
"Furthermore, there will be no Statute this week."
"The Council is not aware of any forthcoming negotiations."
"When are they to take place?"
"They will never take place!"
"How can we expect governments that have already said that they will use the opt-out clause to agree tomorrow to allow us equality?"
"This is nonsense."
"We really are clutching at straws here."
"There will be no Statute this week."
"It is as simple as that."
"I therefore believe that it makes more sense to follow the recommendation of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and to say that we confirm Parliament's resolution of 3 December 1998."
"We are of course prepared to negotiate with the Council, and we should have concluded the negotiations by the end of October."
"The Statute can enter into force on 1 November, 1 December or 1 January."
"So why not?"
"There is absolutely no problem with this."
"But today - and I will conclude here - we must say a clear no to all attempts to change Parliament's text of 3 December 1998."
"Applause"
"Mr President, a great many accusations could be levelled against Members of the European Parliament, but they could never be accused of putting their own interests first, because on the occasion of a debate on their own rights, privileges, interests and immunities, the House is practically deserted, as you can see. Our own interests are clearly not a matter of great priority for us as Members of the European Parliament."
"I have to say however that I do not share the apocalyptic vision presented by my colleague and good friend Willi Rothley on what has happened to relations between Parliament and the Council."
"According to Article 190(5) of the Treaty, 'the European Parliament shall, after seeking an opinion from the Commission and with the approval of the Council acting unanimously, lay down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the duties of its Members'."
"I believe that the Council - and the governments - have demonstrated their goodwill towards Parliament. Firstly, they agreed to something we felt it would be difficult to achieve: the inclusion of this very article in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"We in Parliament had requested it, but we expected the Council - or the governments - to disagree."
"Secondly, Parliament's proposal on the matter received a prompt reply. In other words, the Council studied the matter very quickly and presented us with its opinion."
"The adoption procedure referred to in Article 190 is not the assent procedure."
"The assent procedure is used in connection with international treaties, because once the text of the treaty has been agreed, it cannot be changed by Parliament."
"Parliament cannot amend an international treaty, and that is why we have the assent procedure."
"What we are dealing with here is an adoption procedure."
"The Council has to give its unanimous approval to what Parliament presents."
"Parliament then makes the final decision."
"I do feel however that the Council has shown goodwill in this case. The Council has put forward an alternative text which it would be prepared to accept."
"In so doing, the Council has suggested a way of ensuring unanimity amongst its members."
"In addition, we have the impression that the Council is not totally entrenched in its position."
"Some of the proposals in the Council's text are unreasonable, such as the references to national taxation."
"It would obviously be incompatible with Community rules for Member States to obtain additional funds by taxing Members of the European Parliament. It would amount to a kind of additional Cohesion Fund."
"Nevertheless, the Liberal Group have tabled an amendment that many Members are prepared to support."
"It is based on the text presented by the Council with the opposite aim in mind. In our view, the text of the amendment stands a good chance of being approved by the Council."
"In essence, what is at issue is a principle established by the case-law of the Court of Justice: the principle of loyal collaboration between the institutions."
"Parliament makes a proposal which requires Council authorisation. The Council lays down the conditions for authorisation and Parliament has the chance to study and discuss them again."
"There is therefore no need to overreact. I believe that the stability and definition of the legal basis are of great importance for Parliament and its Members."
"Parliament and the Council should therefore continue to work together to this end. We should not entertain the thought of confrontation without any compromise solution."
"Mr President, Parliament and the Council are of one mind."
"We agree that uniform arrangements for Members of the European Parliament are necessary, that they must be in place soon and that they must be suitable, although we do have certain reservations as to their suitability."
"Nevertheless, I share Mr Medina Ortega's view that it should be possible to resolve our difficulties in the near future."
"In the first place, I should like to make it quite clear that there is no difference of opinion in Parliament regarding the basic salary for Members of the European Parliament, a matter which has provoked much interest amongst the general public."
"Parliament and the Council are agreed on this."
"Where we differ is on the interpretation of the Treaty, on how we understand European law."
"I shall quote a few examples. Firstly, we cannot accept different arrangements for Members from different Member States."
"Parliament is no longer simply an assembly composed of representatives from national governments without any power to act for itself. This change must be appreciated by everyone, and the Statute appreciates it."
"Parliament has been representing the people of Europe for a good many years now. We are therefore seeking a uniform statute which takes account of the present situation, as provided for in the Treaty."
"Mr Medina referred to the law of treaties."
"Reserve is a standard cutting tool used in public international law."
"Reserve is also the tool chosen by the Council to rush through what amounts to de-communitarisation, differentiation and discrimination between Members of the European Parliament."
"We are fundamentally opposed to the method chosen. Clearly, we are required to reach an agreement, so if the method has to be retained, it should be subject to a time restriction and covered by transitional arrangements with a clearly defined time limit."
"This is the only way to a solution, because I think this is the most important point."
"Of course we would like to see a statute in place but not if that meant sacrificing its very essence: equal treatment for all Members of the European Parliament."
"We must also uphold Parliament's rights. It is not a case of defending them against attack, but of upholding them for the benefit of all, because the Treaty requires a particular interinstitutional balance and none other."
"Given that the Treaty lays down an extremely unusual procedure insofar as it is for Parliament to devise a text and for the Council to approve it, we ought not suddenly and surreptitiously to disrupt that balance."
"Let us agree to start with what we have before us, discuss matters and reach an agreement as soon as possible."
"Nevertheless, it is essential for each party to be quite clear as to its role under the Treaty."
"This is not the only difficulty we have at present. There are areas where the actual role of Member of Parliament is unacceptable to us."
"I could quote the clear example of the pension scheme, which is neither logical nor acceptable. Parliament has now come of age and the Statute should therefore allow it room for manoeuvre on clearly defined issues such as its own rights."
"Provision would therefore be made for all the necessary arrangements relating to the implementation of this Statute in a different way from that laid down in Article 190(5). This article is cumbersome and calls for unanimity in the Council."
"It could almost be said that a number of mechanisms are unreasonable and lacking in proportion. Greater flexibility is called for so that specific points can be changed to suit the real situation."
"As I conclude my final speech of this parliamentary term, replying to Mr Rothley on behalf of the European People's Party, I am put in mind of a splendid speech made in the Spanish constituent assembly which drafted our 1812 constitution. One member of that assembly said to another that he would defend his own arguments steadfastly and passionately whilst remaining loyal to his opponent."
"Mr Rothley is worthy of the same treatment. Thank you, Mr Rothley, for your work on this report and on all the others for which you have been rapporteur before this House."
"Mr President, I have to say that Mr Rothley has been consistent."
"Throughout the whole procedure, he has endeavoured to put a stop to it."
"If the Liberals had not forced the pace of the discussions in the Legal Affairs Committee, there would have been no report on 3 December."
"Mr Rothley did not think there would be."
"If we had not driven it home in all the capital cities of the Member States that we should speed up the deliberations in the Council, then I do not think this would have materialised."
"But the position adopted by Mr Rothley has been consistent."
"I am quite sure that if we do not reach a decision now, reform will be brushed aside in the future, and we shall not achieve what we would like to do, namely to get rid of the lack of clarity surrounding pay and allowances before the June elections."
"My sense of legal justice is deeply offended by the way in which the law is being used as a shield by so many people against what they do not want to face, or in order to avoid saying what is really at issue. There is an old expression: the end justifies the means."
"I think it is rather strange that after many rounds of negotiations with the Council, it is then suddenly announced, just before the finishing post, that it is not possible to alter Parliament's position."
"That is illogical and we cannot accept it."
"We Liberals have been prepared to accept, for the most part, the position of the Council."
"My view is that we would then have a unique legitimacy."
"Unlike many other parliaments, we would have rules governing our salaries which are laid down in conjunction with another democratic body."
"We would be able to combine the best of the Member States' traditions."
"It is vital that we now have a system where the rules governing what is acceptable in terms of expenses are clear, and we must have greater transparency when dealing with resources."
"It is true that the Liberals are the first to have tabled an amendment which aims to ensure a compromise, and which I hope can be adopted by the House tomorrow and accepted by the Council."
"Most of the points in the amendment refer to aspects that have already been approved by Parliament."
"Finally, I should like to put a question to the rapporteur: what is there in our compromise proposal that he is unable to approve?"
"Mr President, it is difficult to contain certain feelings of indignation when discussing the Statute for Members and all it involves. This indignation is due to the atmosphere in which the debates have been held, under pressure from the claims made by some in the media which resulted in the debate becoming rather unbalanced."
"As we are all aware, these circumstances combined to create unnecessary tension. This was not at all helpful as we sought to achieve our aim: establishing a unified legal status for all Members."
"At this juncture we find that the pressures which had a negative influence on discussion of the report have been considerably aggravated by the imminence of the elections."
"Nevertheless, we must keep two points very much in mind."
"The first is formal in nature: as the rapporteur stated, the Council has infringed Article 190(5) of the Treaty."
"Secondly, the Statute must be adopted during this parliamentary term."
"Further, its adoption must entail collaboration between both institutions, Parliament and the Council."
"It is certainly not acceptable for the Council to present a proposal to Parliament expecting it to be approved."
"Such an approach calls Parliament's independence into question."
"Nevertheless, Parliament and the Council must find a way of cooperating with a view to adopting the Statute."
"Outright rejection of the Council's proposal does not seem wise if we are to move ahead with the Statute according to the agreed timetable."
"Therefore, although I agree with the rapporteur's criticisms of the form and content of the proposal, I am in favour of urgent collaboration and negotiation between Parliament and the Council so that work on the Statute can be concluded and the Statute adopted."
"Mr President, the Council has put forward its own proposal and the European Parliament is now about to get on its high horse over it."
"Why?"
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights is saying that the Council must not put forward its own proposal and has to support Parliament's proposal."
"But how is it possible, I would then ask Mr Rothley, that you have spent three months negotiating with this selfsame Council in the knowledge that the Council, which has to reach a decision by unanimity, would very probably put forward amendments?"
"I find that a particularly feeble argument."
"The gist of what those opposed to this are saying is really that Parliament should defy the Council and not allow it to walk all over us."
"You know my group."
"We are usually in favour, but not now, not on this matter."
"The danger is that Parliament will lose sight of everything except procedural mistakes and problems over the implementation of certain parts."
"Those exist, it is true."
"But supporting the Rothley report will mean that the European Parliament shows itself to be both touchy and short-sighted."
"There is no solution which pleases everyone completely, but I think that we should settle for half a loaf rather than no bread."
"That means giving and taking."
"My group is willing to do that."
"Together with the Liberal Group, we have tabled an amendment which makes changes to the Council proposal."
"It contains things which I do not agree with, in all honesty - and that goes for the majority of my group as well."
"But we are very keen to do absolutely everything possible to reach a solution this week and to adopt a statute this week."
"If we do not manage it, if we do not get a statute this week or in the very near future, I wish all Members of the House good luck as they confront a public opinion which will justifiably wonder whether there is anyone at all in the European Parliament who has the slightest sense of responsibility."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Italy we have a saying that the hunter should beware lest he himself ends up the hunted."
"And that is exactly what happened to the European Parliament when it gave responsibility for this issue to Mr Rothley, whose intellectual honesty I would never question but whose strategy - as you know - I find very unsound."
"We wanted to have our voice heard and we are now in fact having to square up to a Council which, needless to say, within the space of 48 hours, is presenting us with its own version, the way it, the Council, wants to deal with Members of this House, including allowances, mission expenses and so on. Before we know where we are, the Council will also be deciding on the level of pay to which we are entitled, whether or not we should sign up and at what level."
"And that is all because this suicidal - and I do mean suicidal - strategy of seeking to fit in with the Council's approach was adopted."
"We ought to have demanded the right to give ourselves a statute - that ought to have been the strategy! - a statute with a capital 'S', covering incompatibility, Members' privileges and status, but not our financial arrangements, which are an internal matter."
"But we went for a different strategy: we decided that the Rothley line was the one to follow, and here we are today with Mr Rothley himself complaining that the whole thing is unacceptable."
"But the damage has been done and clearly, yet again, the Council has us cornered."
"All of us, from the Greens to the Liberals and the rest, fretting over three newspaper articles, will tomorrow be compelled to accept the Council text."
"I hope that we do not accept it;"
"I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that although we all want a statute, we reiterate tomorrow what we said on 3 December."
"I do not see why what was acceptable on 3 December, when some of those principles were affirmed, should not be voted for tomorrow."
"Let us perhaps proceed to the vote, but let us give the text on the Members' Statute real substance, or the opportunity will be lost to us."
"Mr President, at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents this afternoon, we agreed to try to arrange the voting so that there was a clear vote showing who wanted to clean things up and who did not."
"The secretaries-general will now meet tomorrow morning to organise the voting."
"My starting-point in the Europe of Nations group is that we will vote in favour of the Council's draft Statute, even though in principle we are strong opponents of turning Members of Parliament into EU officials."
"A common statute turns us into the EU's representatives in the Member States instead of the countries' representatives in the EU."
"In principle, we want to be paid the same as members of the national parliaments and to pay tax like the members of the public who vote for us."
"If we nonetheless feel able to vote for the Council's proposal, it is because in practice a majority of those here in Parliament want to continue claiming EUR 1 000 for a journey costing EUR 400, for example, and we give higher priority to cleaning up travel payments than to our objection in principle to common salaries and conditions of employment, and here we would particularly emphasise the fact there will be the possibility of taxing EU salaries nationally."
"In the circumstances, the proposal which the Council has arrived at is a good one, and we recommend the Council to reach corresponding rules for the appointment of the new Commission and new civil servants in the institutions."
"The counter-argument that there should be equal pay for equal work is not feasible when it comes to international cooperation."
"The Council's members would then have the same salary, staff at the EU countries' embassies would have a uniform salary and experts would have the same, regardless of whether they represent agricultural organisations from a poor or a rich country."
"Equal pay is a nice principle, but the countries are not yet the same, and at the moment it is more important to get rid of Parliament's wastefulness."
"Mr President, Mr Rothley's report rightly points to a number of shortcomings, imperfections and even errors in the draft Statute for Members of the European Parliament which the Council of Ministers has put before us."
"I agree with some of the rapporteur's criticisms."
"But nevertheless, we shall be throwing the baby out with the bath water if we approve this report tomorrow."
"We must after all have the courage to speak the truth."
"The imperfect Statute which the Council has submitted, and it can certainly be improved, is at any rate better, a great deal better, than what we have at present."
"More to the point, it is precisely because Parliament has never succeeded in putting its own house in order that we were firstly, and rightly, held to account by public opinion and secondly, equally rightly, that we are being treated like children by the Council of Ministers."
"It is totally inappropriate to invoke the subsidiarity principle in this report for our own ends, when we never apply that same subsidiarity principle when the interests of the people in our Member States are at stake."
"In short, I entirely agree with the minority opinion of Mr Fabre-Aubrespy which is appended to the report."
"I would add that I am against the Europeanisation of our mandate, because I am in this Chamber to represent Flanders and not some kind of European superstate, because I am opposed to the tax advantages inherent in that Euro-statute, and I therefore remain in favour of a national tax regime which taxes us in exactly the same way as our voters."
"There is still a good deal wrong with this Statute, I believe."
"Unless the amendments make major and fundamental changes to the Rothley report, we shall in principle be voting against tomorrow."
"Mr President, there are four basic reasons why the text as adjusted by the Council is not acceptable, in my view."
"In the first place, it seriously prejudices and curtails Parliament's autonomy, just when the Treaty of Amsterdam accords us prime responsibility - albeit within the framework of an appropriate interinstitutional agreement in which the Commission and the Council participate in full - for drawing up our Members' Statute, along with clear rules governing their material conditions of work."
"What we have here is not the kind of cooperation the Treaty requires, not comments on the text, but a whole new text, and we are being asked to take it or leave it."
"Secondly, the text does not achieve the fundamental objective of equal treatment based on what are effectively equivalent allowances: the possibility of double taxation, at European and national level, is an outrage."
"Thirdly, it rigidly determines a range of figures, rejecting a system of equal, flexible and evolving parameters, thereby penalising future Members of this House in particular."
"Fourthly and lastly, it lays down in detail administrative procedures which cover even secretarial expenditure, and the effect is to create detailed and unduly bureaucratic rules; this impinges on Parliament's own area of responsibility for adopting measures which the House should be drawing up independently, through its own internal bodies."
"I therefore agree with the position taken by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights that the discussion should be continued in a constructive way and a text rapidly established which is satisfactory to all."
"We all agree on the objectives that we wish to achieve."
"But it would be absurd to approve, in the form of a miracle amendment, a statute that has neither been properly discussed nor examined in great enough detail."
"I would remind the House that, along with the Statute, there are other crucial issues on the agenda."
"Ineligibility and incompatibility, for instance, the limit on the number of times Members may stand for re-election, reducing the number of Members and resolving conflicts of interest."
"We have to take a stand against attempts to conceal what is effectively lobbyism, against the growing trend towards professional parliamentarians which is increasingly detracting from the function of democratic representation."
"Max Weber pointed out in a classic of its kind many years ago that even independent people will in general want to live for politics, stressing that, were this not the case, all parliaments would be left with no more than paid party officials representing specific interests."
"I hope that, however we may vote, we each have a proper sense of our own dignity and take pride in the fact that a statute will be helpful and useful if it enables every representative of the people to enjoy real independence and freedom."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what the Council has presented us with in the last week is in my view a double distortion of the content of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Article 190(5) states quite clearly that Parliament lays down a statute and the Council approves it."
"If a codecision procedure in the sense of Article 189(b) had been intended, the founding fathers of the Amsterdam Treaty would have written that the Article 189(b) procedure applied. But they did not do so."
"They expressly stated, with good reason, that the Article 190(5) procedure applies, in which Parliament lays down a specific text and the Council approves it."
"But what the Council has now done is to present us with a completely new text."
"The only element that is the same is Article 1(1)."
"The other 14 pages are different."
"With the best will in the world this cannot be described as an assent procedure."
"Added to this is the fact that the Council has doubly violated the spirit and meaning of the Treaty because it has violated the Treaty's intention to establish equal treatment of MEPs by introducing a special tax to align MEPs' incomes with the national parliaments, and it restores this inequality by the back door, as it were."
"This is a double violation of the provisions of the Treaty."
"In my opinion we cannot as a result approve the Council's proposal."
"Furthermore, I consider it unacceptable for a freely elected Member of Parliament, a freely elected Parliament, to be treated like an employee of the Council and to have to engage in collective bargaining with it."
"This is particularly unacceptable as we adopted a very even and well-balanced paper on this in the December part-session, making MEPs' parliamentary allowances in future lower than those of the Members of Parliament of the three largest EU Member States in terms of population."
"For the Germans this means giving up almost DM 1 500 per month, to put it in concrete terms."
"I consider this to be very balanced."
"Moreover, many of the provisions in the Council draft are impractical and unusable."
"Without going into detail, as time is short, I shall say quite bluntly that I feel some of the points, particularly those on medical cover and the calculation of pension rights, are malicious."
"The text presented here by the Liberals as an amendment is in my view already inadmissible because it changes the whole text and therefore contravenes Rule 125 of the Rules of Procedure."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force on 1 May, and Parliament has gained significantly more power as a result."
"If we were to approve the Council proposal and the Liberal amendment and not the paper drafted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights under Mr Rothley, then we would be depriving ourselves of power again on a crucial issue that affects us directly."
"I cannot imagine that the House will do this at tomorrow's vote."
"Therefore we support the Rothley report."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I would like to say to both the rapporteur and the Council of Ministers: settle your differences now, and stop being so self-important!"
"It is now or never."
"Either we adopt a modified version of the Council's proposal or we will still be squabbling about this in five years' time."
"That does not bear thinking about."
"It would destroy Parliament's reputation and spoil the pleasure of our work."
"To my protesting colleagues in the large groups, I would say: you have held this up for long enough with all your explanations and legal hair-splitting, which I have sat on two committees and listened to."
"Now try to be a bit constructive!"
"To the Council of Ministers, I would say: stop wasting time on trivialities."
"The proposal which the Council of Ministers put forward was far too concerned with wanting to 'make it better'."
"We Liberals are able to accept the Council's proposal, but we are proposing some modifications so that we can achieve majority support for it here in Parliament."
"If it still goes wrong, the voters will have to give their verdict in June."
"Finally, in spite of everything I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, for accepting my proposal to allow countries with high rates of income tax to impose an additional tax on top of the EU tax."
"I wish he had shown the same consideration and flexibility with regard to the wishes of other countries."
"Is Parliament prepared to cultivate its own garden, Mr President?"
"There was a majority in favour of that last December, and the Council has taken things forward on that basis."
"That is not to say that I welcome the Council's proposal."
"Getting rid of the once-only chance to choose for Members who are re-elected may perhaps make for greater clarity, but it seriously undermines the basis of the system."
"The possibility of national taxation on top of European tax is a logical consequence of subsidiarity."
"But the European tax of up to 40 % does not allow the offsetting of items such as relief on mortgage interest."
"The average of the 15 current Member States is a socially acceptable level of remuneration."
"The fact that many European officials receive more suggests above all that the pay scales for officials should be reviewed."
"Unfortunately, the rules on the end-of-service allowance are not at all generous."
"For example, a Member who has served two full terms will cease to receive any income after ten months."
"The Member States are responsible for providing an adequate transitional arrangement."
"To sum up, the Council proposal deserves the benefit of the doubt."
"Parliament would be showing itself in a very poor light if it rejected this chance of a serious and responsible system of remuneration."
"Mr President, I am speaking on my own behalf, like Mr Medina Ortega, as we will not form a group opinion until this evening."
"I do not wish to dwell on details as we will discuss these in any case in due course."
"Today we are concerned with the fundamental issues."
"We are concerned with the European Parliament and the self-image of the only legitimate, freely and directly elected body of the European Union."
"The Members of this Parliament are subject only to their consciences and to the will of the people of Europe."
"We do not need anyone to tell us what to do, not a group chairman, nor a Conference of Presidents, and certainly not the Council."
"The people of Europe are concerned with much more urgent problems than a statute for MEPs."
"If we are to be able to solve the really significant problems as a Parliament we must not allow ourselves to become puppets on such a minor issue as this Statute."
"This is exactly what the Council is trying to do."
"It is simply not fulfilling its Treaty obligations and is ignoring the decision approved by Parliament on 3 December 1998 by an overwhelming majority."
"Instead of this we are being given a mass of detailed rules that are incomplete, inconsistent, amateurish and highly dangerous for democracy."
"I have to say that I am extremely concerned about this."
"We must not allowed ourselves to be restricted by financial dependency or to be given a binding mandate."
"If we do not succeed in safeguarding individual MEPs' freedom of decision we cannot claim to be able to accomplish anything for the people of Europe."
"So let us continue along the right path that has been outlined for us by our rapporteur Willy Rothley, a path which Parliament has already agreed on."
"It is only by doing this that we can retain our standing with the electorate and continue to hope for their trust."
"Mr President, I do not agree with Mr Rothley, because to start with it is completely incorrect - as he well knows - to say that we can adopt a statute in October or November."
"Time is pressing."
"We shall not be part of it, neither he nor myself, but Parliament is about to face the electorate and you simply cannot afford to say: 'ah yes, this Statute which has taken so much work, that can wait a while, the voters will trust us'."
"Mr Rothley is wrong to say that there is no need to talk about this any further this week."
"He knows full well that Coreper is meeting again tomorrow."
"If we do not take this chance of reversing an illegal situation of discrimination on grounds of nationality, which is at odds with Article 6 of the Treaty and which we ourselves have allowed to persist here for years, we shall not get the chance again, but we can discuss it here openly and honestly with the Council."
"Consequently, the Liberal Group has put forward a proposal on the basis of Mr Rothley's proposals, brought into line in some respects with the Council's proposal, and I hope that we shall get a majority vote in favour of it tomorrow."
"Mr President, Mr Rothley, ladies and gentlemen, I would be happy to believe the rapporteur, if some of his supporters were not a little suspect."
"Because the fact is that I am struck by one thing, Mr Rothley, namely that when we voted on your text, some people were completely and utterly opposed to it."
"Today, they are in favour of putting it on ice."
"So I think we must not be naive here."
"It may be that your legal reasons and arguments are valid, but I have the feeling that some of your supporters have a hidden agenda and do not really want some of these privileges to be called into question, because so many strange arguments are being used."
"They say that what the Council is suggesting creates inequality."
"Let us be honest, we have inequality here today."
"Today there are MEPs who are earning four times more or four times less."
"Even our European Parliament text contained inequalities, because we worked out a transitional arrangement for the salary for a parliamentary term, and we worked out the same thing for the supplementary pension."
"There too, there were two systems."
"So the question is this: is the Council proposal a fair basis on which to negotiate in the immediate future and reach agreement before the new term starts, or is it not?"
"There are some in the Socialist Group who think it is, and that we should negotiate on that basis: not just because of the media, not just because of public opinion, not just because of the voters, but because we need to set things to rights in our own House and to prove, when we speak for the peoples of Europe, for our democratic voters, that we do have some small degree of affinity with ordinary people and that we are putting a stop to a number of practices as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, I believe that we must insist today that there has to be a common statute for MEPs, and that this issue must be addressed this week."
"It is an issue that can no longer be pushed aside."
"Regretfully, it has to be said that the Council was slow in dealing with this matter."
"Parliament approved it more than six months ago, and the criticism voiced here that Parliament has had too little time to become acquainted with the document that the Council drafted, is to some extent justified."
"But it is vital that the Statute should be approved before the new Parliament commences its term of office."
"We need to have talks with the Council, and I agree that these talks will be worthwhile in order to achieve results and settle a few fairly minor details that are seen as problematic."
"The agreement, however, should contain a solution for harmonised rates of pay and scope for national taxation, so that the extra tax generated can benefit each Member State."
"We should also abandon the system of flat rate travel expenses and adhere to one of bona fide costs incurred, but one that includes expenses incurred through travel in one's home country."
"I believe this is also a matter of fairness."
"MEPs must also be prepared to have their overheads and office costs expense claims checked to ensure that resources have been used according to what has been agreed, as the Council proposes."
"In any case. I cannot approve the position that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has adopted, as it only means postponing the issue."
"A solution has to be reached now."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have followed this afternoon's debate in the House with great interest. For my part I shall merely stress the importance of reaching agreement on the Statute for Members at the earliest opportunity."
"As you are aware, we have participated in the relevant procedures agreed at the Vienna European Council last December."
"In March, we provisionally issued the ruling called for in Article 190(5) of the Treaty."
"The ruling was formally confirmed by the Commission and forwarded to Parliament when the Treaty came into force."
"We appreciate that a number of exceptions or a transitional period may prove unavoidable for reasons of political expediency."
"We are prepared to accept these in the interests of an agreement provided that the number of exceptions is kept as low as possible and that they serve to pave the way to a single and uniform statute. Above all, they must lead to the implementation of a system of equal payment for all Members of the European Parliament as soon as possible."
"What we are certainly opposed to is any solution involving a review of the European Communities' protocol on privileges and immunities."
"This issue has been taken into account."
"We have also made every effort to guarantee that the cost to the Community budget of implementation of the Statute is taken into consideration in the financial perspective."
"I believe that the text of the Interinstitutional Agreement reflects the progress made in this direction."
"We trust that a solution acceptable to Parliament and to the Council will be reached in the near future. Nevertheless, we understand that Parliament has to decide if the Council's present position is acceptable in full or in part and we hope agreement will soon be possible."
"Before concluding I must convey to Mr Rothley how much I have valued his work over the years."
"I have no wish to express an opinion on Mr Rothley's views on the issue before us today. I do however want to say that as a Commissioner and in previous years as a Member of this House, I have always valued the power of his arguments and the strength of his convictions, whether or not I have agreed with them."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The sitting was suspended at 7.02 p.m. and resumed at 8 p.m."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I first have an announcement to make. In the votes this afternoon, Parliament confirmed its opinions given on Commission proposals subject to a change of procedure following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"In this context, the Council has informed me that the following common positions which it had adopted on these proposals remain unchanged."
"This concerns: Agenda 2000 - European Social Fund;"
"Agenda 2000 - European Regional Development Fund; protection of workers in explosive atmospheres; and finally, charging of heavy goods vehicles."
"Budget estimates for the European Parliament and the European Ombudsman for 2000"
"The next item is the report (A4-0227/99) by Mrs Müller, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament and the estimates of revenue and expenditure of the Ombudsman for the financial year 2000."
"Madam President, I would like to ask for your help."
"I can see nobody at all here from Parliament's administration, and Mr Wynn and Mr Samland are already all too familiar with what I have to say."
"In view of this, I am really not prepared to speak here."
"Perhaps you could advise me what to do."
"I could hand in my speech in writing, and then we would save five minutes and you could move straight on."
"But I do not think this is the right way to proceed."
"Of course everyone is in group meetings discussing the Statute, and that is where I should be now too."
"So please tell me what I should do."
"However, I feel that it would be beneath my dignity - and this is of course not intended as a criticism of those who are present - to complete the procedure in this way."
"I can quite appreciate what you say, and this is something that unfortunately happens to us very often."
"We had just finished in the groups, and then we quickly came running along here."
"I hope our colleagues will also be with us soon."
"We shall try to get them here without delay."
"I would ask you not to submit your speech in writing, since we do have Mr Wynn, Mr Samland and others with us in the Chamber."
"I should like to hear your speech, Mrs Müller, I really would."
"So please do make it!"
"I am very fond of you all, but perhaps you could request once again that somebody from Parliament's administration should be present, because what I have to say is of course primarily aimed at them."
"Having my target audience absent really makes this rather difficult."
"So, I shall just grind out my speech, like it or not."
"Madam President, acting Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday evening and this morning we discussed the reforms that a new Commission needs to tackle as a matter of urgency."
"We formulated conditions that both individual Commissioners and the Commission collectively should fulfil, not just in terms of substance, but also as regards procedure."
"I hope and indeed I am confident that the vitality of this debate will also infect this House."
"The European Parliament's preliminary draft estimates for the year 2000 provide us with an opportunity to do this, and as rapporteur I would like to make a brief introduction to the debate - assuming there will be one, that is."
"I believe that the influence wielded by political institutions is not just a matter of legal clauses and treaty articles."
"As parliamentarians we are particularly aware that political subject matter is only as good as the scope for communicating it through the process of public debate."
"So we will have to ensure that the new powers conferred on us by the Treaty of Amsterdam a few days ago are underpinned by our collective credibility."
"That is our true political capital."
"The first of the two central themes that I would like to see governing the future administrative development of the House is therefore 'greater trust based on greater transparency'."
"I am firmly convinced that adopting the Statute for Members of the European Parliament would be a crucial step in this direction."
"In the expectation that a decision to this effect will be taken this year, the Budgets Committee has therefore included an amount of EUR 60 million in the reserve and has created a staff reserve to cover the additional administrative requirements expected."
"This means we can finally dispense with special pots of money such as the two special pension funds for Members, which have repeatedly been the subject of public criticism of Parliament."
"Furthermore, it is worth remembering at this point that the amount originally earmarked for setting up a supermarket, EUR 3.8 million, is no longer included in the preliminary estimates."
"Another relevant point in this context is that the repayment period for the new buildings has now been definitively set at 10 years instead of 15, so that the interest burden over the whole period has been reduced by some EUR 60 million, thus avoiding the need for a hidden loan from future budgets."
"I feel that this sends the right signals if we are to regain the confidence of the electorate. The target of not spending more than 20 % of the entire administrative expenditure category for the Parliament is one which we ourselves have observed for years, and the Budgets Committee believes, as do I, that this target must definitely be respected."
"A one-off overshoot is only tolerable if the Statute for Members is budgetised, but it should be partly reduced towards the previous level in the coming year and return to that level in 2001."
"At the same time, improvements in Parliament's administrative efficiency are both necessary and achievable."
"If we are to exploit the scope for greater efficiency, we need less bureaucracy and more decentralisation - in short an improvement in motivation by delegating more responsibility, including to those at middle management level."
"So it is now a question of actively implementing - both in the House and within the groups - the budgetisation system on which the Budgets Committee has already held a hearing."
"I am delighted that the administration has assured us that the additional tasks it will have to take on because of the Amsterdam Treaty coming into force and preparations for enlargement will be totally covered by the existing staff complement."
"We can do this only in cooperation with the staff, and we would not want it any other way."
"That is why the Budgets Committee has fundamentally signed up to the new staff policy, the centrepiece of which is promotion on the basis of sustained merit, with an average promotion cycle of five years."
"For the coming budget year, this means that the decision taken to completely clear the promotion backlog will lead to upgradings for 26.5 % of staff with scope for promotion."
"Furthermore, this system will help to put a stop to the practice of party-political or nationally motivated promotions through several grades at a time."
"I would like to conclude by addressing several systemic problems that I have encountered under the budget procedure to date."
"A problem that I have come across in relation to ad personam promotions is that I as rapporteur am supposed to approve individual promotions which I assume are justified, but for which I cannot really take responsibility."
"I therefore propose that there should be a system for ad personam promotions, for example by means of an annual budget including all long-term costs."
"Another problem, as I see it, is that the short period which rapporteurs have to acquaint themselves with the subject matter is scarcely adequate to grasp the complex interrelated issues within the administration."
"From a purely informational point of view, the annual reporting process is too weak in relation to the administration."
"And one last point: I am firmly convinced - and I have to say that my views have moved on in this respect - that we need more efficient simultaneous self-regulation by the House itself, particularly in relation to the Bureau."
"This includes both budgetary and staff policy debates and a new system of Bureau rulings and political control of this."
"But the golden rule for Parliament is still 'greater trust leads to greater transparency'."
"Madam President, I thank Mrs Müller for her contribution."
"I am glad she did not just put it in writing."
"As the Socialist coordinator let me say that the group will be supporting the report as it stands with the amendment from the Committee on Budgets which was voted on last night concerning the extra upgradings for the ad personams ."
"Having said that, I have discharged my duty as the coordinator."
"As there are so few people here and whilst very few people are concerned about the debate, I shall concentrate on two points on which I will speak in a personal capacity."
"The first is on paragraph 1 where we mention the need for a Members' statute and an assistants' statute."
"Our group wants a Members' statute and an assistants' statute."
"I want a Members' statute."
"I am fed up with everybody thinking I am some sort of crook."
"I want the clarification to be such that my expenses are paid from Parliament, are audited, are accounted and that no one can point the finger at me."
"Because I have that attitude when we look at what is being called for, nothing will happen until we get the statutes."
"It is pretty obvious from the discussions I have heard over the last two days that the Members' Statute will be an ongoing discussion for the next few weeks, if not the next few months."
"Having said that, we could actually take two courses of action which would help us considerably and would be a sign of good faith to the Council to show that we are serious."
"There is nothing to stop this Parliament as from 20 July having assistants paid directly by Parliament, rather than being paid by the Members."
"We could do that."
"We could have the safeguards on redundancy payments and we could have the safeguards on pension contributions from Parliament rather than Members being responsible for it."
"On the other proposal which the Council has been asking for, namely the audits of our general office allowances, there is no reason why on 20 July, if we do not have an agreement on the Members' Statute we should not say there will be an annual audit of the general office allowance which must be submitted to Parliament, carried out by bona fide auditors and must be submitted to Parliament for Members to receive their annual allowance."
"We could do those two things without the Members' Statute."
"On the final paragraphs where we talk about the cost of the buildings and the total budgetary amounts, we are almost up to EUR 1 billion for Parliament's budget."
"If you look at those figures that works out at about EUR 1.5m for each Member."
"When the press sees that figure I am sure it will make a lot of it."
"But of course we cannot be compared to national parliaments."
"They do not have interpretation and translation costs."
"National parliaments do not work in three places of work."
"National parliaments are not buying their buildings like we are or renting a variety of buildings."
"So that figure can be somewhat misleading."
"The one thing about these figures is that we have to look for prudence."
"We cannot just call on the other institutions to tighten their belts."
"We have to look at every available opportunity to save money."
"One of my pet hobby-horses is the two sessions we are now bound to have in October in Strasbourg."
"Much as I love Strasbourg, coming here twice in October for two five-day sessions is a waste of our time and energy."
"There is no reason why we could not have two sessions in Strasbourg - one being of three days and one of two days within the same week."
"If we did that we would save a considerable amount of money."
"Madam President, I should like to thank Edith Müller who, despite the low turnout, personally presented her report."
"It is a good report in my view and its content is entirely relevant. Reports are always better received if they are presented by the rapporteurs themselves, and even more so in Edith's case."
"As I said, Madam President, this is a good document which I shall broadly support. What is more, the report's content seems entirely logical, given that a Parliament that intends to take on bigger responsibilities certainly needs to grow in terms of telecommunications, computing and personnel."
"At present, only the Council seems to believe it is possible to broaden and deepen the European Union by making budget cuts."
"Perhaps the most striking aspect of the report is the issue of promotions, particularly since it talks about 490 promotions when in recent years there have been an average of 150."
"However, what we need to do here is to listen, just as we have listened, to the administration and to look at how it has changed and how staff policy will change further still, that is, how staff are managed in this House."
"I therefore think that this new system of promotions based on sustained merit and not solely on the availability of a particular job will be of benefit to Parliament."
"I therefore fully support this idea."
"With regard to promotions, and more specifically paragraph 2, which contains a reference to them, Mr Filippi and myself intend to table an amendment which, further to accepting the 490 promotions, also supports those permanent and temporary jobs that have already been accepted, as well as the three ad personam promotions."
"Madam President, Mrs Müller has produced an excellent report as a basis for next year's budget, and I would like to thank her sincerely."
"I would just like to raise one issue, which relates to the European Ombudsman's budget."
"This is a new institution, which was created only in 1995."
"However, it has proved to be both a much-needed and viable arrangement."
"The problem is simply a lack of resources."
"The number of staff employed in this office, in proportion to the number of cases they have to deal with, is considerably smaller than that in their counterparts in the Member States."
"The problem is made even worse by the fact that the staff required need to be exceptionally well qualified, and for that reason they are difficult to recruit."
"Up till now, Parliament has reacted reasonably favourably to the proposals of the Ombudsman, Jacob Söderman, for addressing the most urgent staffing problems."
"This has to be acknowledged, although our reactions have been helped along by the fact that the funding required has not been on a very large scale."
"However, improvements should be allowed to continue."
"Now that the new interinstitutional agreement has been reached, financial resources are quite limited, but nevertheless the number of staff working in this institution should be increased."
"I hope that there can be a systematic increase in resources made available to the European Ombudsman in the budget proper, as that is the way we can best promote the public's confidence in the work of the EU generally."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, well, those of you who are still here, I think that as we are amongst experts, there are only a few key points to make about the budget for Parliament for the year 2000."
"First, we are deciding on a budget which takes us into the next millennium."
"This will be the first year of the new millennium, and a new Parliament will of course have to implement this budget."
"We will also have a new Commission."
"And this budget may also be based on a new interinstitutional agreement."
"That brings us to the first and most important point."
"If we do not accept the interinstitutional agreement this Thursday, that is if we cannot summon up 314 votes for it, then the additional EUR 155 million provided for Category 5 will not be available."
"That would mean that the additional 20 % which would in turn be available to the European Parliament from the EUR 155 million would not after all be available."
"As a consequence, with continuing expenditure we would exceed the 20 % ceiling."
"In other words, we would not be able to keep expenditure within the 20 % limit."
"This is simply one more argument for Members to vote in favour on Thursday, if we do not want also to cut back our activities."
"Second, we have taken a very major step in staff policy."
"The Secretary-General is sitting next to you, Madam President, and my comments now are addressed to him."
"The decision we have taken in committee and recommended to Parliament involves promoting around 20 % of all staff with scope for promotion."
"This is an enormous step, and as I said at the beginning of this debate, I cannot help feeling - as we were in a situation of deadlock - that there is always a wave of promotions in the year when one Parliament steps down and the next is elected."
"During the discussion that we had with him during the conciliation procedure and also in the committee itself, the Secretary-General assured us that this was the start of a new staff policy, under which quality and not the passport you hold would be the key to promotion."
"I have no way of monitoring this, but I would urge those Members who return to the House to watch very carefully that the measure that we have agreed to as a concession continues to be observed over the next few years."
"I am confident that the Secretary-General will continue to adhere to the undertaking he has given us in future, with the new Parliament."
"I particularly welcome the fact that by virtue of a Bureau decision we have upgraded the 60 posts for ushers, including those here in the Chamber, from Category D to Category C, in four stages. This follows on consistently from the steps we have already taken in recent years."
"I would also like to be very explicit about the buildings - these comments are addressed to you, Madam President, and to the Bureau."
"We have expressed our willingness to retrospectively implement the ad personam promotions resulting from Mrs Müller's amendment, on condition that the Bureau respects its undertaking to finance the buildings within a ten-year period."
"The corrected Berlin decision means that all the prerequisites for this are in place."
"I am asking you too to respect this promise - just as we have done one our side - by honouring the ad personam promotions."
"I would like to make one final and very personal comment."
"I believe that a parliament that wishes to be equal to the tasks demanded of it, and this applies all the more so following the Treaty of Amsterdam, needs to have an employment structure for assistants that allows it to do full justice to these tasks."
"Over the last ten years, since 1989, I have been one of the people who have secured a more than 100 % increase in the flat-rate allowance for assistants."
"I stand by this, as I believe that good and well qualified academic assistants are essential if a Member who takes his work seriously is to carry out his duties to the full."
"I would therefore recommend that the new Parliament should return to this subject, as things have been at a standstill for two years now while we have been dealing with other issues, but we must come back to this point if our assistants are to work well."
"Madam President, firstly I would like to thank Mrs Müller for an excellent report, the contents of which I entirely endorse."
"Considering that the European Parliament aspires to purge the European Union of abuses as a responsible wielder of budgetary power, I personally have problems with the fact that the European Parliament is promoting 490 of its officials in the year 2000."
"That number is three times what it was for this year, for example."
"It would be easy to put things in black and white and state that I cannot approve of these promotions."
"When, however, I listened to the report of Mr Priestley, Secretary-General of the European Parliament, in the Committee on Budgets, I had to admit that things were the same as ever: knowledge breeds problems."
"I myself know that over the period 1995-1996, when I worked here in Parliament, the practice and bases for promotion were not always fair."
"For that reason, I believe that we have to be able to correct distortions in staff promotion, especially as Mr Priestley has assured us that this will be a one-off occasion used to correct distortions and that in the future we will follow established practice and fully comply with the rules that promotion is to be based solely on qualifications and ability, rules which maintain the principle of transparency."
"Our role in the European Parliament is to keep to a tight budget for ourselves as well."
"Our role is to ensure that there is transparency."
"I hope that Mr Priestley will find a way to keep MEPs informed about progress made in positive administrative reforms."
"Thank you, Mrs Laurila."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Preliminary draft general budget - year 2000"
"The next item is the presentation by the Commission of the preliminary draft general budget for the financial year 2000."
"I am in a bit of a difficult position because the audience is more limited here today than it was in the Committee on Budgets yesterday and all the people that are here listened to me yesterday on the same item."
"So I will be brief."
"With the adoption of the preliminary draft budget for the year 2000 the Commission has launched the budget procedure for the budget authority."
"But as the question of the new interinstitutional agreement is as yet undecided: it is to be discussed tomorrow and voted on Thursday, and the preliminary draft budget will have to be completed in the autumn."
"This can be done by means of an amending letter."
"As the chairman of the Budget Committee mentioned yesterday, in the Budget Committee there is a problem with timing: how to guarantee that both arms of the budget authority can deal properly with the amending letter."
"That must be discussed in this Commission and with the new President, to find a convenient way."
"The Commission envisages a budget for the year 2000 which will require, overall, less commitment of appropriations than the 1999 budget."
"This is mainly due to a slight decline in agricultural spending and because of the new financial framework for structural funds."
"The payment rates will, however, grow substantially due to the backlog, in particular for structural funds but also for research and external relations."
"For agriculture, if the interinstitutional agreement is accepted, it means that the new budget structure makes it possible to distinguish clearly between, on the one hand, the traditional market expenditure on income support which will be obligatory and, on the other hand, the new rural development expenditure which would be non-obligatory expenditure."
"We must say today that, on the basis of the current estimates, the ceiling on market expenditure adopted in Berlin provides a new and immediately effective element of budget discipline."
"With regard to structural expenditure, BDP for the year 2000 is based on the decisions of Berlin."
"We understand that with certain modifications Parliament is about to follow them."
"At first glance the budget appears to indicate a radical reduction - 16 % - in commitments from 1999."
"But the fact is that rebudgeting in 1999 and the transfer of rural structural expenditure to Category I distorts the picture."
"All things considered, the reduction of structural commitments is more modest, closer to 6 %."
"At the moment BDP does not provide for the Community initiative URBAN, but the decisions on this matter will be incorporated into the budget proposal at a later stage in the procedure."
"The margin for manoeuvre for internal policies is more limited than Agenda 2000 had hoped for but if the interinstitutional agreement is accepted, it will provide a welcome extra breathing space."
"The Commission has proposed continuing the efforts of recent years to focus the internal policies on growth and employment-related expenditure, in particular research and technical development, trans-European networks, education and training, and on the small- and medium-sized enterprises, which has been a parliamentary initiative."
"The budget proposal for 2000 has been prepared in full application of the 1998 agreement on the legal bases."
"It distinguishes autonomous pilot and preparatory actions and thus provides a reliable base for the decisions of the budgetary authority and for uncontested execution of the 2000 budget."
"As to the external expenditure, there is a marked increase in the total amounts because of the new and reinforced pre-accession assistance."
"We must note that the situation in the Balkans may require a substantial addition of financial resources from the Community budget."
"The institutions have already, for that reason, agreed to review the situation in the light of developments."
"If necessary there is the possibility of revising the financial perspectives, and that has been declared by the Council also."
"Finally, administrative expenditure, which was discussed for Parliament a while ago: given the growth in pension expenditure the ceiling set in Berlin is just about sufficient to finance the status quo in terms of personnel."
"This has always been made clear by the Commission."
"The preliminary draft budget therefore had to postpone the question of possible new staff and its pre-allocation until the margins which will possibly become available under the new institutional agreement have become clear and until the new Commission has had a chance to define its requirements."
"Of course all the necessary preparatory work will be done by this Commission."
"But we find it appropriate that, after the vote of confidence, the new Commission should allocate resources."
"The question of staff policy will be a key question in the autumn."
"I agree that the Community institutions require adequate human resources to be able to execute their new tasks properly."
"There are certainly bottlenecks, in particular in financial management, which will be overcome most quickly with new posts."
"But still, let us not forget that human resources will always be scarce and measures of redeployment, retraining and flexibility will lose none of their importance for the future."
"Further work is required by Parliament, particularly as it debates and votes on Agenda 2000, and by the next Commission and Parliament to complete the Community budget for the year 2000."
"But today's BDP already gives the first hint that the new financial framework will work for the Union, that a balance has been found between the rigour prevailing throughout Europe and the financial requirements for the key policies of the Union."
"But very much depends on decisions this week."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we have listened to you very carefully."
"Your PDB reflects what you have been able to achieve; it is not entirely to our satisfaction, but we shall not make things difficult for you."
"The exercise is in effect an academic one."
"You are making a proposal in a context which there is no reason to suppose will be the right one."
"You quite logically acted on the conclusions reached in Berlin."
"So if there is an interinstitutional agreement you will have additional margins, and if not, the position will be entirely different."
"So we have here a text which is more or less academic."
"You have not sought to hide the fact from us, and we appreciate that."
"Regarding Category 1 expenditure, the funds are in fact adequate overall, although you are already a little short on sub-ceiling 1 'Organisation of the markets', and you are counting on all this being dealt with by some kind of favourable outturn."
"But our resources are already limited."
"As regards Category 2, there are a number of things which cause us some concern."
"The reduction in commitments, which you mentioned, seems to us to make sense and we are not worried by that."
"There is in fact a rebudgeting of earlier commitments which will not happen, since we are at the end of the programme."
"There will, however, be massive appropriations for payment which we shall have to find."
"Efforts will be needed to limit, address and settle what we call in French the 'RAL ', the balance to be cleared."
"When it comes to Category 3, internal policies, we are quite frankly unhappy."
"The proposals you put forward are broadly negative, and we simply see that whatever the scenario adopted, we shall have additional margins."
"The figures for Category 4 are, as you say, totally unrealistic since this is a draft budget which takes no account of Kosovo."
"And Kosovo will be a factor in our finances."
"The same applies to Category 5."
"You cannot plan ahead meaningfully, you have neither the means nor the willingness to do so."
"You cannot anticipate the administrative reforms which will be carried out in the months ahead."
"In other words, this is a starting-point which will need a good deal of work on our part and yours before it becomes a true budget."
"Madam President, I rise to make just one point, but an important one."
"It relates to an issue that the Commissioner touched upon rather tangentially."
"I have in mind the issue of adjusting expenditure in line with a decision that may be taken this week."
"If we accept the interinstitutional agreement on Thursday, Parliament is then free on the basis of that agreement to implement appropriations from Category 1 to Category 4 at first reading."
"However, we cannot do this for Category 5, where we need a letter of amendment from the Commission."
"As I indicated during the discussion with Mr Prodi this afternoon, the present timetable Parliament has set for appointing the new Commission, which involves the Commission being appointed by the earliest in mid-September, means that there are only two weeks left to submit this letter of amendment."
"Whatever happens, we ought to have it before the European Parliament's first reading, as otherwise we will be at the mercy of the Council when it comes to making additional appropriations available in Category 5, because if the letter is not submitted until after Parliament's first reading, an amendment will only be permissible if both parts of the budget authority, that is the Council and the Parliament, agree to it."
"I would therefore ask the Commissioner and the officials responsible for this to start work on the preparatory process now."
"Mr Prodi also gave an undertaking to this effect in the meeting with the committee chairman, so that an appropriate letter of amendment can be presented within this time frame, allowing Parliament to take it at first reading."
"Thank you for that comment, Mr Samland."
"I think the Commissioner has taken it on board, and the Bureau will ensure that the point is passed on once again."
"The debate is closed."
"Charging of heavy goods vehicles"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0245/99), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council (13651/3/98 - C4-0037/99-96/0182(COD)) with a view to adopting a Council Directive on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures (Rapporteur: Mr Jarzembowski)."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I beg for your attention on certain legal and factual issues."
"Perhaps the Secretary-General could remain with us - we need a lawyer."
"Mr Secretary-General, I would be grateful if you just stay here for a minute, because this is important."
"Madam President, I believe that a vote tomorrow on my report would be erroneous in law, illegal and impossible."
"I would like to give my reasons for this statement and to call on Parliament and the Bureau to use their authority to postpone tomorrow's vote on my report."
"My justification for this is as follows. We considered these issues in the Committee on Transport and Tourism last week, but the situation has changed now that the Treaty of Amsterdam has come into force."
"This morning we quite rightly resumed the procedure during first reading and we repeated Parliament's position from the previous first reading."
"The committee services have now published a report numbered A-0000, which is a corrected version of my report A-0245, which is on the agenda."
"So this is a new report which I have not even been able to read properly yet, because the procedural page includes explanations in French, and I assume that you should be able to read your own report in your own language."
"And what does the procedural page say, as far as I can make out?"
"It says that the Council has confirmed its common position."
"First of all, I consider that to be illegal, because according to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Council should have consulted the Committee of the Regions."
"I do not know how it did that in just a few seconds, because we only had the first reading at 12.00 noon and I think this is a result of earlier this morning, before we had the first reading."
"That is the first legal error!"
"Secondly, in the procedural page of a report that I have never signed, it says that today, during the sitting on 4 May, the President of the European Parliament has confirmed the common position and has referred the common position to the Committee on Transport and Tourism as the committee responsible."
"However, the Committee on Transport has not met since 12.00 noon today, nor is a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning."
"So I do not know how it is possible to complete the second reading of a report in the Committee on Transport in a procedurally correct manner, if this report is to be voted on tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Madam President, the report on the agenda is not therefore valid, as it is has been drawn up in accordance with Maastricht."
"The report that I have now been given has a zero number instead of an agenda number, it is not even in my own language, and it refers the report, the common position that is, to the Committee on Transport, which is not meeting."
"The explanation given by some administrative services to the effect that we knew this last week and anticipated it, and that we considered last week what we wished to do, may be all very interesting from a legal theory point of view, but it is not acceptable for us to have a first reading today, for a report to be referred to the Committee on Transport when it is not meeting, and for the administration to amend my report from last week and to say that it is a second reading report."
"Well, you clever lawyers, I informed the Sittings Service about this yesterday, so that they could consider it in good time. In my opinion, the report cannot be voted on tomorrow and it must be officially deleted from the agenda."
"I attach particularly great importance to this because we are looking at a report on road user charges, and the European Court of Justice declared the first directive to be void because of a legal error, namely inadequate consultation of Parliament, and declared that it would only remain in effect until the renewed decision-making process had been completed."
"I would regard it as being highly inappropriate if Parliament were tomorrow to adopt a proposal for a directive that was once again defective because of a legal error."
"I call upon the administration to check this very carefully, and I must insist that, as is quite right, it should be Parliament, its Members and committees that decide, and not some officials who take it upon themselves to do this by altering the procedural page."
"I do take this very seriously, Madam President, and I hope that your staff, when they examine this objectively, will come to the conclusion tomorrow that the report - whatever report that is, whatever number it has, I mean report A-0245, which is on the agenda and has a definite subject matter - well, I would consider it as highly questionable for a report to be rewritten by officials and suddenly put on the agenda."
"That cannot be right!"
"In my view the Council common position, as the President has said, and no matter how defective it may be because of failure to consult the committee, is now with the Committee on Transport, and that committee is not meeting this week."
"Now let me turn to the actual content of the report, as we must after all say something about that."
"I regard the decision taken by the majority last week to approve the common position as being a crass error."
"I would like to illustrate this with one or two arguments."
"In my second reading report, we simply reiterated the reservations we had at the first reading."
"These were swept aside by the Socialists, because Austrian Members and their Swiss friends want to sew up the EU/Switzerland convention come what may, and have therefore brushed aside any reservations."
"That is simply not acceptable, and I shall give you two reasons why."
"I think it is highly questionable for the Commission to declare, in a political agreement, if the common position gets through, that we should withdraw our complaint against Austria regarding excessive toll charges as a matter of political agreement."
"I still believe that the current Commission and Neil Kinnock are subject to the law, and that if the Commission has justifiably made a complaint, this complaint cannot be withdrawn as a result of political chicanery and by way of a political deal. I say that because I believe that the Commission should be bound by the law and not by political trickery."
"Secondly, I believe that the level of toll charges agreed by the Council is quite simply intolerably low."
"I have never understood the Socialists, who are calling for a great hike in road user charges in principle, but whose demands fall short of the level Parliament judged to be correct by a large majority in 1997, which was higher than the Council has proposed now."
"I regard this as grovelling before the Council, which has effectively said 'you can like it or lump it!'."
"According to Maastricht we have the right of codecision and of approving the common position in this case."
"As Christian Democrats, we cannot consent to withdrawing from the codecision procedure at the expense of our road haulage companies and at the expense of the environment."
"So I hope that we can still achieve a reasonable form of consultation at second reading."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I am sorry that our last transport policy debate before the elections is taking place in such unsatisfactory circumstances. But, Mr Jarzembowski, this is pure cynicism on your part."
"You have consistently tried everything to prevent a system being adopted and have done everything to prevent external costs, for example, being included in toll charges or road user charges. And now you, of all people, are suddenly pretending that this agreement would be far too low and would not help the environmental situation."
"Secondly, there are the legal arguments."
"Although I am a trained lawyer, I am not a European Parliament lawyer."
"I would not be so presumptuous."
"Nevertheless, Mr Jarzembowski, it was your proposal - your specific proposal at the last meeting of the committee - that we should vote on the second reading, and that we should confirm the first reading again for formal reasons so that we could take a decision on this subject today."
"You yourself, Mr Jarzembowski, said that we should take a decision and proposed this procedure."
"You have said today that parliamentarians should take this decision, and not officials."
"It was the parliamentarians who made it!"
"Even if the officials have perhaps made incorrect allocations here and there, it is the parliamentarians who have made the decision here, on the basis of your proposal."
"But let me get to the heart of the matter, because that is what I am really interested in."
"The central issue is that in recent years transport policy proposals have been blocked, for two reasons."
"First, because we have been unable to reach a solution on the Eurovignette, because of opposition from members of your party, not because they argued that the result would be too low, but because they were fundamentally opposed to it, as they were against making progress on European Union transport policy."
"The second reason was that Switzerland opted for a solution which although it might be understandable from its own point of view, was not a solution that sat well alongside European integration."
"That is why it was right that there have been negotiations on this, and with negotiations you always find that you cannot achieve the ideal solution, as otherwise there would be no compromise and no consensus, but at least you reach a consensus, even if not all interests are reconciled."
"However, in this case we have managed to achieve a consensus with Switzerland which opens up that country and which fits in well with European integration, including transport policy issues, and which at the same time makes it clear that the principles of an environmentally friendly transport policy can be realised with the introduction of the Eurovignette and by diverting transport from road to rail."
"Madam President, I would particularly like to think Commissioner Kinnock very sincerely for all his understanding and patience when taking part in negotiations here and in always keeping to the law."
"But he has also got a good political head on his shoulders, thank goodness, because we need Commissioners who can think in political terms, whilst respecting the law, and who want to make progress."
"Commissioner Kinnock has achieved progress, and on behalf of my group I would particularly like to thank him on the occasion of this last transport policy debate."
"We do not know if he will continue to be the Commissioner for transport policy."
"He has some splendid achievements to his credit in recent years, in this field as well as in others, and that should not go unrecorded."
"We have complained enough about Commissioners here, but we can also give praise where praise is due."
"Mr Jarzembowski, I have a word of advice for you. It is a Danish proverb which I hope can be translated."
"It says: 'people who ride oxen get there too'."
"You are very concerned about certain principles in this matter."
"I can understand that."
"On the other hand, there is always room for improvements."
"You should not feel victimised by the Socialists in this case."
"On the contrary, there is cooperation here, but the important point is to get something on the table and to make it stick, so that it has real meaning."
"From that point, we can take things further."
"Even this proposal can be improved."
"In fact, I do not understand the squabbling we have had which Mr Swoboda touched on."
"It is irritating that we should be talking about it on the last evening, during the debate on the last transport item."
"We have been through many good items together, such as the 'port state' and 'short-sea' issues, so I would urge you to support this decision."
"We are working towards environmentally friendly transport, and it can still be improved."
"That is why I have asked for speaking time this evening."
"It is in order to appeal to you personally, because I believe we have misunderstood each other on this matter."
"Madam President, may I also be permitted to thank Mr Kinnock, and I am sure we shall see him for many years to come in this House."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Members of this honourable House for the kind things they have said, and also to say to Mr Jarzembowski that he will know that I completely respect the thoroughness and effectiveness of his work even when, on odd occasions, I am not in total agreement with his conclusions."
"Tonight we have in the House three very fastidious, excellent Members of Parliament and even though Members will know my political pedigree, and it diverges from that of Mr Jarzembowski, nothing could take away the affection and respect I have for him and his work."
"On the procedural points, which he makes with force and sincerity, I know he will forgive me if I do not get engaged in these arguments because the expertise and, indeed, the responsibility for dealing with the issues lies elsewhere."
"I should like, therefore, to concentrate on the substance of this issue, which, as both Mr Sindal and Mr Swoboda have said, is a matter of critical importance, so far as I am concerned, and so far as the development of the common transport policy is concerned."
"As Mr Jarzembowski reminded us, it is nearly four years since the European Court annulled the first and only directive on road charging."
"It is nearly three years since the Commission submitted its proposal to replace that annulled directive, and nearly two years since Mr Jarzembowski's first report was debated here at first reading."
"We have grown old together with this measure."
"In the time since then, a great deal of work has been put into trying to achieve the present state of progress in all the Community institutions."
"I am very grateful for the commitment that has been shown in dealing with the second reading of the Eurovignette proposal, particularly in this Parliament."
"This new piece of legislation is both necessary and significant."
"It will fulfil the Community's legal obligation to adopt a new directive to replace the annulled directive and, most important as far as I am concerned, it is a vital step towards a common framework for differentiated charging systems in the whole of the European Union."
"Naturally the legislation, as Mr Swoboda says, is the product of a compromise that reconciles a variety of concerns and interests."
"Honourable Members may take some satisfaction from the fact that, whilst it differs in a number of points from the Commission's original proposal, the directive, as it turns out, is closer to the opinion of Parliament in several respects."
"For example, the compromise does not contain an explicit provision to include external costs in existing charges, although it allows, and in some cases requires, differentiation of existing charges in order to reflect environmental and other effects."
"I know there is not unanimous enthusiasm for that principle but it is certainly one that I would seek to uphold."
"The Commission feels that this directive as it now exists represents a useful first move towards fair and efficient pricing in road truck haulage, and we welcome the willingness of Parliament and the Council to make that advance while, at the same time, we continue to emphasise the need for further work on quantifying external costs for all modes."
"As honourable Members will recall, that was also specified in Mrs Schmidbauer's very good report on the Commission's White Paper on fair payment for infrastructure use, and we are currently embarked on that task of quantifying the externalities with the help, obviously, of an expert group."
"When the results of that work are available, they will provide another component for use in the ongoing consideration of the internalisation of external costs, which will, I know, be an increasingly important subject of attention in the next Parliament."
"Meanwhile, as the House will know, the main features of the common position reached on the current directive are the setting of minimum vehicle tax rates at the levels of the existing directive and without differentiation according to Euroclass, the maintenance of certain transitional measures on vehicle taxes, the establishment of maximum rates of user charges with a differentiated structure as proposed by the Council, the provision for an enabling power so that toll rates can be differentiated according to the emission class of the vehicle and the time of day when the road is used, provision for Austria to apply an infrastructure cost-related toll on the motorway section between Kufstein and Brenner, and provision for a 50 % reduction in user charges for vehicles registered in Greece."
"As the House will know, the Commission proposed Article 75 as the legal base for this measure since we maintain that it is appropriate for developing the common transport policy even when legislation contains some elements relating to fiscal provisions."
"The Council disagreed and it added Article 99 of the Treaty as a legal base as a result of ministers' view that the provisions on annual vehicle taxes in Chapter 2 make it a substantial fiscal measure."
"I am sure this will bring the citizens of Europe cheering out on to the streets."
"The Council's common position is an acceptable balance between what is needed and what is feasible."
"It maintains progress in the common transport policy and it is consistent with the purposes pursued by at least the substantial majority in this House over several years."
"All of us have some cause to be encouraged by the fact that a long and sometimes arduous legislative process has been concluded successfully."
"I want to express particular thanks to Members from all parts of the House, especially in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, for the valuable contributions that they and Parliament in general have made to achieving that success."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my dear Neil, it is a great honour for me, as we reach the conclusion of the transport debates over recent years, once again to express my group's appreciation for the excellent cooperation we have achieved."
"We may have different political views, but we have always had trust in each other."
"I believe that it is important for there to be trust between the institutions and for each to recognise the competence of the others."
"We have always done that."
"I would therefore like to thank you once again, and to say farewell, whatever office you may hold next time."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote is scheduled for tomorrow."
"We shall establish beforehand whether it takes place at 12 noon."
"You commented on this at the beginning of the debate."
"I shall ensure that we decide on the basis of legal advice whether we vote tomorrow."
"If so, the vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Distance marketing of financial services"
"The next item is the report (A4-0190/99) by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive concerning the distance marketing of consumer financial services and amending Council Directive 90/619/EEC and Directives 97/7/EC and 98/27/EC (COM(98)0468 - C4-0647/98-98/0245(COD))."
"Madam President, it is quite some time ago that I was rapporteur on the general directive, the parent directive if you like, on distance selling to consumers."
"Financial services were a subject for distance marketing then as well."
"But the objections voiced at the time by the financial sector meant that we did not in the end get any uniform rules for the distance marketing of financial services."
"If I worked in financial services, I might now scratch my head and wonder if it might not have been better then to lobby in a different direction."
"After lengthy pressure from Parliament, the Commission has now come up with an amendment to the general directive of 1997."
"I would acknowledge that the proposal now before us contains a number of provisions which take particular account of the specific nature of financial services."
"I should like to make one or two comments on this proposal, and I have to say that your rapporteur is not happy with the way in which the vote on the proposal went in the Legal Affairs Committee and in the Committee on Consumer Protection."
"It would be unprecedented for the rapporteur to refrain from expressing a point of view."
"I am happy, however, with the amendments tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for which Mrs Kestelijn was draftsman."
"Let us consider the proposal."
"In it, the Commission is opting for a maximum of harmonisation."
"Right from the start, I fully endorsed this idea of maximum harmonisation."
"If we want the single market to work as well as it possibly can, then in the fast-developing area of new media like the Internet and e-mail, all consumers must be entitled to the same high level of protection in every Member State, irrespective of where a purchase is made."
"To my mind, the often cross-border nature of financial provision means that this is absolutely essential."
"For these reasons, a number of amendments were adopted in the Committee on the Environment which cause me considerable difficulty."
"I will also look at one or two other points, for example the question of the reflection period."
"When I drafted my report, I had numerous discussions with the financial services sector and with consumer organisations."
"I very quickly realised that the so-called reflection period, Article 3 of the proposal, was not at all welcomed."
"If the provider has to hold a price for 14 days, that means unacceptably high financial risks which are certainly not in the consumer's interest either."
"So the sector is very much in favour of scrapping the reflection period."
"The amendments now place the emphasis on providing information, and that too is consistent with the parent directive."
"A number of amendments have been tabled, and overall my view as rapporteur is that Amendment No 47, tabled by my group, is actually the best one."
"The right of withdrawal, Article 4 of the Commission proposal, is subject to a number of very complicated conditions."
"In the interests of consumer protection and legal soundness, I think it is necessary to have a general right of withdrawal."
"But in order not to disadvantage the financial sector too much, the duration of that right must not be too long."
"The period of 14 days which I see the PPE Group is suggesting seems to me to get the balance right."
"A third point is the derogation proposed for notaries public."
"The Commission proposal also seeks to protect the consumer against entering too hastily into agreements concluded by distance marketing."
"But if a notary assists in the conclusion of an agreement, I do not think you can claim that the consumer is being steamrollered here."
"So I do think that agreements concluded with the assistance of a notary can be exempted."
"Then there is the problem of unsolicited communications."
"Communications to the consumer which he has not requested have to be controlled."
"The Commission does not really make a choice here."
"I am making a choice, and I favour the so-called 'opt-out' system."
"Looking at the whole thing, I am bound to say that this should work."
"When we looked at the parent directive, I was all for having financial services included at any cost, but now I think that this has to be done in a proper manner."
"I hope that if things are not looking too good after the first reading, then in the second reading at least the consistent logic of your rapporteur will win the day in the plenary."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a key theme in the debates in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has of course been whether we should go for the principle of maximum harmonisation proposed by the Commission or whether we should stick to minimum harmonisation for the time being."
"In the end, a majority was in favour of the minimum harmonisation approach."
"We agreed that it might be sensible to switch to maximum harmonisation in the foreseeable future."
"However, the starting point for this principle should not be the financial services directive itself. Instead, the directive on distance marketing of goods should be included in this right from the beginning."
"There is an urgent need to bring the two distance marketing directives into line with the directive on electronic commerce, as soon as we know what form it will finally take."
"Despite the need for such adjustments in the future, we should point the way now towards the healthy development of distance marketing of financial services in Europe - healthy for service providers and healthy for consumers."
"I therefore welcome the fact that the committee responsible shares my view that we should not have a reflection period, which is an absurdity in legal and practical terms, but that a general right of withdrawal should be introduced instead."
"However, what I do not agree with is the length of the withdrawal period, which is now 30 days in the committee's report."
"I feel that this is far too long and will above all make financial services more expensive for consumers."
"I think that 14 days as from the time when the customer has full knowledge of the contractual terms and conditions is adequate."
"Furthermore, the list of exceptions to the right of withdrawal still needs to be added to. In particular, it should take account of mortgages and the contracts already mentioned by the rapporteur, 'contracts which have come into being with full notarial advice given to the consumer'."
"Nor do I share the scepticism and anxiety about electronic communication which is evident in some amendments."
"A consumer who does not want to make use of it will not have to, and can continue to have personal contact with his bank and insurance company."
"But we should not make things too difficult for those people who do want to use these new facilities, by demanding that everything is duplicated on paper, for example."
"That is not the way to develop the enormous potential of distance marketing of financial services for business and for the consumer."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, I should first of all like to point to the numerous advantages which the distance marketing of financial services can offer."
"Using the Internet, the provider can offer his services to clients across national borders without extra cost, and the consumer, without moving from his chair, can compare the services of different providers in both his own country and in others."
"Convinced of these benefits of distance selling, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted by 42 to 2 in favour of the following position."
"Above all, we are in favour of total harmonisation."
"If we want a real single market for financial services, consumers and providers must be guaranteed the same rights everywhere in the Union."
"We feel that a formal cooling-off period puts unnecessary pressure on the consumer to make a decision within 14 days."
"It is enough for the provider to state clearly how long his offer will remain open."
"The committee also favours a conditional period of 14 days during which the contract may be cancelled."
"And lastly, we believe that the consumer should be provided, at the time of the negotiation, with all the information he needs to evaluate the offer."
"We do not think it is a good thing to hand over the completed contract at this stage."
"This position closely reflects the original, balanced report of Mrs Oomen, who has indeed done an excellent job."
"While the Environment Committee has approved a number of proposals aimed at significantly tightening up consumer protection, I do not believe that this goal will be achieved with a minimum directive, a 30-day cancellation period and the exchange at the time of negotiation of a full and legally complex contract plus a summary."
"Proposals of this kind will merely discourage people from buying and selling services via the Internet, by fax and by post."
"Moreover, we wish to ensure that the consumer who makes a bank transfer or concludes a contract of insurance face to face and not by remote methods is not at any time less protected."
"On behalf of my group, I am therefore retabling a number of proposals by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in a slightly amended form, and I would commend these to the House."
"Mr President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens has just referred to, stressed very strongly the need for consumer protection."
"In the great debate that occupies us tonight between minimum and maximum harmonisation, those who are arguing, as the Environment Committee did, for minimum harmonisation, are doing so not because they wish to stall the proceedings of the Internet but because they do not want to see in individual Member States consumer protection significantly diminished, as it might be, by the levels of information provided in the directive as it stands."
"It seems to me, therefore, that the onus is on those who wish to see maximum harmonisation to put this case not merely in terms of what is good for the market and the single market but in terms of how the levels of information and protection can be raised in the subsequent stages of discussion of this proposed directive before it comes back for second reading."
"We are all open to persuasion on that issue but we simply do not believe at the moment that the case has been made."
"I have to say that to my own Member State government and to others who have taken that view."
"We believe that consumer protection is critical."
"It is not some ancillary add-on element in this."
"I would say to those who argue on behalf of the expanded single market and its dynamism, look at the facts."
"A recent survey in the UK showed that 81 % of those surveyed never intended to use the Internet at all for commercial transactions."
"50 % of those surveyed believed that they would be defrauded if they used the Internet."
"When you have that level of suspicion you have to address the point."
"I believe that the amendments tabled by the Environment Committee have done precisely that."
"We have seen that the stress lies not with the reflection period - and it is right to scrap that - but with an unconditional right of withdrawal."
"We have tried to set terms and conditions within which that right of withdrawal is to be exercised."
"We have said not to the whiz kid consumer but to the marginal consumer who is nervous of the Internet that they can have a valid copy of the contract provided to them in a medium they can understand and which appears to them to have a measure of permanence."
"Most of all, we have said that where some other elements have come in, they have to be addressed and recognised, and the way to do this is to do it piecemeal."
"To look at the problems that are raised, for example, by the distant selling of car insurance."
"Having listened to those who sell car insurance over the telephone, Amendment No 38 takes into account the fact that such a transaction must take place before the formal exchange of the durable contract."
"We accept that."
"We accept that there may be a problem with mortgages."
"But that is not to say that mortgages should be excluded from the directive, merely that one has to look at this problem again and see how it can be embraced within the overall context of the directive."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruitjen talked about notaries."
"They may, in translation, be a rather more solid profession than lawyers are in my country."
"It is said that one of the three great lies in the language is the phrase: 'I am a lawyer and I am here to help you'."
"The idea that in all circumstances the fact that you have a lawyer sitting by you guarantees you the normal minimum of consumer protection does not seem to be a satisfactory point to raise."
"Once again we want to go here as far as we can for the absolute in consumer protection and information."
"We do that essentially because we accept that the Internet is an amazingly exciting form of bringing about new transactions - expanding commerce, industry and jobs within the Community - but never at the expense of individual consumers in any Member State in the Union and as far as possible protecting those not merely within the boundaries of the Union but beyond it as well."
"Mr President, monetary union will provide new opportunities for increased cross-border trade, which should definitely be encouraged."
"New technologies also contribute towards increasing consumer choice."
"Similarly, accessibility stimulates competition, thereby making our markets more efficient."
"This report is an important one, since it reinforces the internal market in financial services."
"Unfortunately, the proposal now before us means that the directive is more regulatory and creates more difficulties, rather than making matters simpler for the market players."
"We in the PPE Group therefore wish to reject the amendments tabled by the committee responsible."
"Instead, I would endorse the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, which is based on the Commission's original proposal."
"It is important to protect consumers, but the legislators should not be allowed to forget altogether that unduly complex legislation raises prices for consumers and hinders trade between people in the market."
"The extra costs which this directive may create, if it becomes too complex and bureaucratic, will in the end always be imposed on the consumer."
"Consequently, I wish that the Environment Committee had listened more attentively to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, who - as usual where these issues are concerned - has weighed up the implications very carefully."
"As regards electronic commerce, I believe that the new technologies which offer us new sales and distribution channels really will revolutionise the markets."
"So we cannot afford to be cautious, even to the point of being hostile towards the new technologies."
"Instead, we should do everything possible to make it easy for them, since there really could be a consumer revolution that would drive down prices and provide alternatives."
"I therefore despair when I see the niggardly attitude displayed by some people towards the new ways of doing business."
"In my view, it is precisely in this sector that the European Union should be strengthening its competitiveness by accepting the new methods rather than obstructing them."
"Mr President, the aim of the proposal is to facilitate the sale by telephone, fax and Internet of financial services such as banking, insurance, investment and mortgages while at the same time protecting the consumer from fraud, high-pressure salesmanship and certain unsolicited sales communications."
"I support the main thrust of this directive as we must strike a balance between promoting commercial enterprise and protecting European consumers at all times."
"I have no hesitation in saying that promotional campaigns by banks and other lending agencies are contributing in a major way to inflationary house prices, thus putting housing outside the affordability of young people wishing to set up their first home."
"This is something which the European Central Bank, in cooperation with the central bank in each Member State, should urgently examine."
"The main provisions of this directive include the following: the consumer will have a 14-day period before concluding a contract which will give that person time to compare various proposals and study the contract in detail before giving a final agreement; the consumer will have a 14-day withdrawal period, 30 days for mortgage loans, life insurance and pensions, to renounce the contract without penalties and without giving reasons."
"This right may be exercised in only two cases: if the contract was signed before the consumer knew the contractual terms and conditions and if he was subject to unfair pressure during the reflection period."
"There is also a limitation of the suppliers' rights to payment if the consumer decides to withdraw after the beginning of the service payment."
"There will also be the implementation of an out-of-court complaints and redress procedure to settle disputes between the consumer and the supplier."
"There will be a ban on enforced sales, that is, the distant supply of unsolicited services."
"I certainly agree with some of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, including the need for setting a deadline of seven working days for the supplier to return monies that have been received from the consumer."
"I believe that if this directive is to be effective it must be implemented sooner rather than later."
"An amendment has been tabled calling for the directive to be transposed into national law by 13 June 2001, instead of the Commission's own proposal of 2002."
"I support this as a policy objective because one of the criticisms of European legislation in general is that it is just not implemented in time."
"Greater effort must be made by the European Commission, Parliament and the Council to implement European Union directives and regulations in as streamlined a manner as possible."
"In conclusion, I also welcome the fact that the Amsterdam Treaty was enacted three days ago and the European Commission has been given enhanced powers to bring forward legislation in the field of consumer affairs with particular emphasis on the protection of human health."
"I look forward to working closely with the Commission in ensuring that more EU regulations and directives on this subject are implemented in the near future."
"Mr President, thanks to the single market and new electronic communications, it has become somewhat easier to buy and sell things in Europe using remote methods."
"For the consumer, sound guarantees and clearly agreed withdrawal rights are extremely important here."
"In some Member States, consumer safeguards are very good."
"In others, there is greater reliance on self-regulation by the market."
"The subsidiarity principle requires us to see how these two approaches can best be combined."
"We can do that by setting minimum European standards and protecting the consumer in such a way that he is perfectly happy to buy financial services using remote methods."
"The radical metamorphosis which the Oomen-Ruijten report underwent in the Environment Committee is therefore quite proper."
"The maximum harmonisation presented initially by the rapporteur is not consistent with previous legislative proposals of the European Union."
"Directive 97/1 on general distance selling opts for minimum harmonisation."
"Under that directive, Member States are free to go further in safeguarding the consumer."
"If we now opt for maximum harmonisation, we shall be creating contradictory legislation."
"Lastly, I should like to point out a small inaccuracy in Amendment No 18."
"Directive 97/1 does not deal with the selling of financial services, but with distance selling."
"Perhaps we can check which directive is in fact being referred to in Amendment No 18."
"Mr President, I support the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, even though our admired rapporteur does not fully agree with its content. However, I also have a number of comments to make regarding several of the points raised because everything is open to debate and can be improved upon."
"I shall refer to three amendments."
"I shall firstly refer to Amendment No 21 to Article 3."
"The right of reflection in my view should be abolished where there is sufficient information. What is more, the reference to the principle of good faith in commercial transactions is a timely one that can be related to the oldest and most unique example of good faith in civil law."
"However, the article contains a somewhat bland, if not dangerous, reference to minors. This is because minors are obviously protected by civil law not only in the part of the transaction based on honesty and good faith, but also because in civil law any transaction will be declared null and void if minors are not old enough according to the category of goods and transactions in question."
"With regard to the other amendment, the famous Amendment No 22 to Article 4 on the right of withdrawal, I am also in favour of extending the 30-day withdrawal period for some contracts, for instance the high-risk contracts such as life insurance and pensions."
"The reference to mortgage contracts must also be qualified because, here again, we must bear in mind that 11 or 12 of the Member States give better mortgage credit protection through deeds and registration at a land registry, so it must be stressed that this text refers to a precontractual phase."
"According to the majority of Member States' legislation, there can be no contract without deeds and registration."
"Therefore, given that here the form is ad substantiam , it is not possible to talk in terms of mortgages, contracts or even credit."
"Lastly, I welcome the reference made to credit cards, because they have certainly been the subject of widespread abuse. In my view, the amendment relating to them, Amendment No 25, should be stringently applied since they are commonly abused through the use of the card number alone without a signature."
"Mr President, since it is difficult to introduce new ideas at this stage of the debate, perhaps the best thing would be to sum up what has been said so far."
"Market globalisation and the spread of new communication and information technologies have undoubtedly given rise to the economic and social changes that are revolutionising the way in which markets serve consumers; they have also transformed the consumers' expectations."
"We therefore need to urgently adapt our Community policies to these changes, particularly those changes that affect marketing methods."
"It is true that we should make greater use of the methods on offer through the Internet for carrying out commercial transactions and accessing financial services, a sector where consumers are currently proving to be more reluctant."
"Mr Whitehead provided us with some interesting figures, and there is no doubt that the use of the Internet in this type of transaction should become even more widespread. What is more, Mr Whitehead, the expression 'never, never, never at the expense of the consumer' certainly rings true."
"Here, however, I should like to tell the Commission about a recent piece of work that refers to the future policies and that is quite excellent. It states that in order for consumers to play their new role in Community policies to the full, they must understand the interdependency of their interests and other interests that also need to be protected."
"In other words, in making people aware of their rights, they must also acknowledge their responsibilities."
"This stems from the fact that we live in a Community of law in which Community responsibilities are conferred."
"As a result, we would be doing the consumer a disservice if, through a sectoral directive, we began to disrupt the balance of the highly complex relations between Community law and the Member States' law, and the principle of subsidiarity has been mentioned in this respect."
"Mr Bru Purón referred to something that he knows a great deal about as a notary, namely mortgage credit."
"To follow on from what he said, it seems to me that we must bear in mind that the European Union currently has several systems of legal traffic concerning property and registration, or advertising registration it might be said."
"However, without doubt, one of the characteristics that must be maintained, for example in Spain, is the binding nature of the constitution and mortgage registration which cannot be subject to any right of withdrawal."
"We must remember, however, that the rules governing mortgage credit are subject to the power of the courts where the asset is located. In this connection, we must give consideration to Article 16(1) of the 1998 Brussels Convention, which Community law must clearly respect, and indeed, this is something Mr Whitehead should respect for the benefit of consumers' interests."
"Here, I must digress a little as you seem deeply mistrustful of lawyers, and I disagree entirely with you."
"I would therefore like to stress that the European building is a legal structure, a structure in law, and if we do not rely on lawyers and, in general, those who work with the law to bridge the gap between the rules and social reality, European integration will fail."
"In short, Mr President, Community law must be respected."
"I personally would prefer a medium degree of harmonisation, or even basic ideas on harmonisation, which will improve and be complemented with time, rather than maximum harmonisation."
"Mr President, from listening to the rapporteur and all the speakers I have seen how important this directive is."
"This is very positive, because we have come a long way and, as you will all remember, not everybody was convinced that there was a need for a directive on financial services."
"The people who are concerned with the consumers' interests will remember the distance selling debate in this House and whatever divisions still exist - and there is still time and room to find some convergence - we have made good progress in establishing some basic rights for consumers."
"I just wish to refer briefly to the three main points I noted during the debate."
"Firstly, the most controversial one: the level of harmonisation."
"There are amendments which introduce an approach of limited harmonisation of the provision introduced by this directive, leaving Member States scope for maintaining or introducing more stringent provisions."
"So there are amendments which call for minimum harmonisation."
"The Commission has proposed that the provisions of the directive should be fully harmonised."
"This is set out clearly in recital 9 so, from this point of view, Amendment No 57 can be considered superfluous but, nevertheless, it reiterates the point."
"The reasoning was that financial services, due to their immaterial character - there is nothing to wrap up in paper - are perfectly suited for distance marketing."
"Adding to this the cross-border perspective of the introduction of the euro, it seemed particularly important to establish a common framework for marketing through these techniques."
"This would be to the benefit of both business and consumers."
"I repeat the principle: we strongly believe that the right of consumers must be seen in perspective in relation to the rights of other sectors."
"But our proposal seems to us to be to the benefit of both business and consumers because both parties would know which rules apply and both parties can be confident that the same marketing rules apply, no matter where the services come from."
"That is a very important point for confidence-building, which can be profitable for both consumers and business."
"In view of this argument, the Commission has concluded that at this stage it will maintain its proposal for full harmonisation."
"I shall just refer to two other points which have been raised in the debate."
"One is information in advance and the other the general right of withdrawal."
"As far as information in advance is concerned, the amendments concern information to consumers in advance of concluding a contract and the amendments reject the concept of a right of reflection based on a draft contract as introduced by the proposal for a directive."
"The Commission can accept the principle established in Amendment No 21 of providing to the consumers in advance of the conclusion of a contract additional or summarising information as a cover of the full contractual terms and conditions."
"However, this principle must take into account the interaction between this horizontal directive and the vertical directives on financial services that include provision of information."
"Consequently, the Commission cannot simply take over the amendments as drafted."
"In particular, we must stress that the principle of information in advance must be applied so that information offered provides added value to the information provision already foreseen in the vertical directives."
"Otherwise it is useless."
"Secondly it must avoid overlaps with the existing information provision and, finally, it must be clear beyond doubt which provisions apply or prevail in case of similarities between provisions in this directive and provisions in the vertical directive."
"So Amendment No 61, which introduces a right to waive the right to obtain information in advance means the Commission, must reject Article 11 as it establishes that consumers may not waive the rights conferred on them by the directive."
"Finally, on the general right of withdrawal."
"If we reject the right of reflection, that leads naturally to putting the emphasis on a general right of withdrawal as provided for in these amendments."
"The guiding principle of this amendment is to align this proposal with the rules of the general directive."
"Again, the Commission accepts the principle but it needs to review the implementation."
"I just wish to mention two questions which remain open at this stage: the duration as well as the scope and extent of any exemption."
"I will not elaborate in detail."
"I have already spoken too much about the amendments."
"At this stage the Commission wanted to give some ideas and reflection on the three major items you have been debating and certainly we will be looking forward to the final result of the vote on this."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees"
"The next item is the report (A4-0224/99) by Mrs Kuhn, on behalf of the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Comittee for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees (C4-0042/99 - C4-0171/99-96/0161(COD))."
"Mr President, I would like to thank both the presidency and Mrs Bonino and her colleagues very sincerely for the fact that we reached an agreement in the trialogue that was accepted by both the Council and by Parliament's delegation."
"On 17 December 1998 Parliament adopted 14 amendments to the common position of the Council."
"During the conciliation procedure, 12 amendments were adopted verbatim or in a form close to the original, which I regard as a positive result."
"In line with the compromise achieved, the deadline for transposition of the directive into national law is now to be 1 January 2002 at the latest, rather than in three year's time."
"It was particularly important for Parliament's delegation that this amendment was accepted, as it will be at that point that the majority of the EU public will handling the euro as cash for the first time, and it is likely that price transparency will lead to more cross-border purchases within the internal market."
"Minimum harmonisation of the law on guarantees will save the consumer unnecessary aggravation."
"It was also accepted that a product produced or manufactured in accordance with a purchaser's requirements, and for which the purchaser supplied the necessary materials, comes under the directive."
"An exception to this is when any lack of conformity that arises is due to the materials supplied."
"If a consumer instals a product himself and a lack of conformity arises as a result of incorrect installation instructions intended for the consumer, this is also covered by the law on guarantees."
"The guarantee directive will be included in the list of actions for restraint to protect the interest of the consumers, and in order to make purchases within the internal market simpler for the consumer, a recommendation will be made to manufacturers whose goods are sold in several Member States that they should provide consumers with a list including at least one contact address in each country where the goods are marketed."
"This is only a recommendation, as to my regret Parliament did not want to go any further, but perhaps many manufacturers of consumer durables will in time see this as an opportunity giving them better prospects for marketing their products throughout the internal market."
"In order to avoid difficulties of interpretation to the detriment of consumers, it was once again made clear in the result of the conciliation that if a product is restored free of charge to the contractually stipulated condition, any costs incurred, such as delivery, labour and materials costs, will be borne by the seller."
"That gives you a brief overview of the most important results of the Conciliation Committee."
"If you vote in favour of this conciliation result, and I presume that you will, consumers in many Member States will be given better legal guarantees for consumer goods, and you can rely on it that this guarantee will ensure a minimum level of protection in each Member State."
"It applies to all consumer goods whether new or second-hand; the legal guarantee is valid for two years, but for second-hand goods, it is up to Member States to decide whether purchasers and sellers can agree on a guarantee period of one year."
"However, in order to avoid misunderstandings, it should at least be made clear to the public that a product is only considered to be non-conforming if the lack of conformity was present at the time of purchase."
"The burden of proof is reversed within the first six months after purchase, which means that it is assumed that a lack of conformity was already present on delivery, unless the seller can prove damage by the consumer or unless the type of product or lack of conformity rules out such an assumption."
"Parliament has supplemented the term 'lack of conformity' in a helpful way."
"A defective product is defined as being non-conforming, and published statements by the manufacturers or distributors in advertising or on the label are included in this definition."
"We welcome this definition, because it is often advertising that leads purchasers to buy."
"The first remedy in the case of non-conforming goods is the right to repair without charge or a replacement product, as far as this is economically viable and feasible."
"If a repair or a replacement product are out of the question as a remedy, the purchaser still has the option of an appropriate price reduction or the termination of the contract."
"By virtue of this hierarchy of remedy options, Parliament has struck a reasonable balance between the interests of consumers and sellers."
"The directive provides for clear conditions, which is also important for commercial guarantees, that is to say guarantees voluntarily provided by manufacturers or sellers."
"In order to ensure that consumers are not misled, guarantees must contain precise and transparent information, including a statement that a given guarantee does not affect the statutory rights of the consumer."
"Unfortunately, I believe that the directive has at least one weak point."
"The common position allows Member States to introduce a two-month time limit for lodging a complaint, in other words the consumer must report the lack of conformity within two months of discovery."
"Even if only one Member State were to introduce this time limit, this would run counter to the philosophy of the directive, which is to achieve minimum harmonisation."
"Unfortunately, at second reading Parliament could not achieve the majority needed to delete this provision."
"Nevertheless, as we stand at the end of the end of this Parliament's legislative term, we have once again succeeded in giving Europe's citizens more rights as consumers, and I would like to thank all the Members of Parliament, the Commission and the Council for achieving this."
"Mr President, it may be appropriate in my few minutes to pay tribute to the rapporteur and with her to the Commissioner who is also with us in this last but one consumer debate of this Parliament, and, indeed, to the processes of co-decision, which we have implemented and which have perhaps meant more in this field than almost any other."
"This has been a significant success for Parliament and also for both the Commission and the Member States in Council."
"I wish I could say that these procedures always go so swiftly but in this case we have a model where many of the reservations that were stated at the outset, many of the fears of commercial interests, many of the fears of parliamentarians, were set at rest by the way in which these procedures went."
"As a result we now have a situation in which there is adequate protection for the consumer both when dealing with the issue of goods that may turn out to be faulty even if those are in part manufactured by the consumers themselves."
"We have successfully addressed the issue of second-hand goods which many feared could not effectively come into this directive."
"We have shown that 'where there's a will, there's a way'."
"You can show that although second-hand goods are, by definition, different from those that are purchased new, a different period of reflection and remedy suffices."
"The whole mechanism of the hierarchy of remedies can and will work effectively and beautifully here."
"So I am very pleased with this."
"I should like to thank Commissioner Bonino for all here help, not just in this but in many other ways in this five years."
"My last words should be to Mrs Kuhn."
"This is her last report in her last Parliament."
"In my opinion she has been a model comrade and a model colleague, diligent, direct, dedicated."
"I wish we had more like here and I wish those outside knew the work that really goes on in the interstices of this Parliament."
"Mr President, like Mr Whitehead, I am pleased to arise in support of Mrs Kuhn."
"This is a very good consumers' report."
"It is as well to remember that in June 1996 the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive of guarantees for consumer goods and after-sales services."
"The intention of the proposal was to create minimum harmonisation of a statutory provision within individual Member States concerning the need for legal guarantees, all of which Mr Whitehead so eloquently referred to."
"The simple aim of the proposal is to ensure that wherever consumers shop in the European Union, they will enjoy minium levels of guarantees and will be able to seek redress in their home countries."
"The directive ensures that Member States must transpose international law by January 2002 and this will create a common set of minimum rules entitling the consumer to redress."
"These are free repairs, replacement, price reduction or the cancellation of the contract in the event of defective purchases."
"At the insistence of this Parliament, free repairs or replacements will also include postage, labour and materials."
"This is excellent work done by this Parliament."
"We have also ensured that compensation for the incorrect installation of goods, for example wardrobes will also apply for the protection of consumers who have been misled by faulty instructions."
"It will be recommended to the producers of consumer goods to attach to their product a list giving at least one contact address in every Member State where the product is marketed."
"The idea is that cross-border shoppers can contact this address if they have problems."
"Member States will be able to create mediation bodies to handle consumer complaints irrespective of whether they are national or cross-border."
"There is also a strong recommendation to provide consumers with manufacturers' contact addresses where goods are sold in several Member States."
"This is important because so many people travel not only across Europe but across the world."
"So, as a member of the Consumer Protection Committee, I have at all times, along with Mrs Kuhn and Mr Whitehead, supported measures that will ensure that the needs and concerns of consumers are given real and appropriate protection by means of European legislation."
"In conclusion, the four-year consumer protection programme for 1999-2003 is worth over £91m and if requests are made for further increases in this budget, I am confident that Parliament would support such recommendations in the future."
"I would like to be associated with Mr Whitehead's remarks in relation to Mrs Kuhn."
"I compliment her on her dedication and commitment in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection down the years and I wish her every joy and good health in the future."
"Mr President, I do not take the floor to repeat the content of this piece of legislation but to commend the good work of Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"If we look at the timing I am particularly pleased that I am speaking on the final point of this directive at the last part-session of our Parliament - which for me is also the last session, at least on consumer matters."
"The Commission introduced this piece of legislation in June 1996."
"It was transmitted to Parliament in August 1996."
"In the meantime some points have changed."
"However, at the end of the day we managed to come forward with a good piece of legislation which will produce better protection for consumers."
"So, as I said, I will not repeat the points of the legislation but I will congratulate in particular the work of Mrs Kuhn and all other colleagues in Parliament."
"For once I will also praise the work of the Commission service."
"When I introduced this directive I told them it would never be approved."
"In fact, in the three years we have been able to work together in such a way that finally this directive is approved."
"This is a good legacy for the next Parliament and the next Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Civil protection"
"The next item is the report (A4-0124/99) by Mrs González Álvarez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Decision establishing a Community action programme in the field of civil protection (COM(98)0768 - C4-0072/99-98/0354(CNS))."
"Mr President, no one doubts the need for a new programme of Community action in the field of civil protection, in this instance to 2004, in spite of the House's lack of enthusiasm for such a programme."
"In 1998, the so-called 'natural' disasters that occurred - although I do not believe that they are always natural - caused 50 000 deaths and losses amounting to ESP 12.4 billion as a result of floods, fires, hurricanes, such as hurricane Mitch, and environmental disasters, such as the problem in Doñana, which has yet to be resolved and which is still causing difficulties. In all of these disasters, civil protection organisations play a vital role, especially if these organisations operate well, if their members are highly trained and if they also form part of a Community cooperation network."
"The amendments that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection approved by a substantial majority have developed several aspects of the Commission's proposal which we believe to be important."
"a)Greater and more effective cooperation between the Member States is needed as there is insufficient cooperation at present.b)The Community must help ensure that there is a better and more intelligent relationship between the protection of persons and goods and nature, which in the future may make it possible to prevent disasters that can be prevented, as many of them can.c)Special mention must be made of the isolated and outermost regions and the difficulties they experience because of their geographical situation, terrain and social conditions."
"Last week our group met in Madeira where we had the opportunity to visit several isolated communities."
"Given the difficulties the people there have in exporting their agricultural produce and the difficulties the Members experienced in travelling there, I cannot see how, in the event of a disaster, for example, these people could possibly cope without adequate resources."
"Some colleagues who had come over from the Azores could not even travel directly to Madeira."
"Instead they first had to travel 1 300 kilometres from the Azores to Lisbon and then a further 900 kilometres from Lisbon to Madeira. They therefore had to travel an enormous distance to participate in the group's work which, on this occasion, centred on ways of tackling the problems facing the outermost regions."
"It is therefore vital to pay more attention to the problems these regions suffer.d)The importance of training is to be highlighted to help citizens protect themselves, even in the event of an environmental emergency."
"I cannot forget some of the environmental emergencies experienced in my country and also throughout the rest of Europe.e)We would stress the need to step up efforts at national, supra-regional, regional and local level in the area of prevention, cooperation and the exchange of experiences.f)We also propose that we should detect and analyse the causes behind these disasters and publish these findings so that they can be used as the basis for prevention.We have adopted the amendment tabled by the Committee on Budgets and are thus ratifying the European Parliament's position on the committee needed to implement the programme, which should be a consultative body. This amendment proposes that the committee should be more transparent and participative."
"We therefore do not agree with Amendment No 24, tabled by Mr Schnellhardt, which proposes that this committee should be of a different nature, even though it does defend the Member States, including my own."
"We believe that we must continue to defend the European Parliament's policy regarding these committees."
"We also agree with the vital role that non-governmental organisations have to play."
"The Committee on the Environment has accepted the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets on cooperation with the countries participating in the PHARE, TACIS and MEDA programmes, that is, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, although as rapporteur I had my doubts."
"We are not against such cooperation, but we are concerned that a small budget of EUR 2 million also has to cover cooperation projects with these countries."
"Nonetheless, these amendments by the Committee on Budgets were approved by the Committee on the Environment and I must defend them here."
"The Committee on Budgets is also concerned that 25 % of the cost of this programme is taken up by administrative expenditure."
"However, the draftsman of the opinion - who is not present - does acknowledge that this might be due to the cost of experts, networking, analysis and training."
"In other words, it is not surprising that administrative costs are so high, although they should be reduced where possible."
"In short, although this programme does not generate much enthusiasm, Commissioner - as I said at the beginning - I believe that it is important."
"I am aware of the work people are carrying out, sometimes on a voluntary basis, in civil organisations, especially in the regions, and I believe that if we work to ensure that these organisations continue to operate, we will be able to help prevent or mitigate the effects of some disasters."
"Since there are no colleagues taking part in the debate, the Chair would like to congratulate you on your report and say that the lack of interest is probably due to a consensus rather than any dislike of the subject."
"Mr President, I agree entirely with your remarks. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and especially its rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, for the work which has been done and also for the interest she has shown during the consideration of this proposal."
"As you know, and as has also been mentioned, the purpose of this proposal is to ensure the continuation of the current action programme in the field of civil protection, which is based on the Council Decision of 1998 which expires on 31 December 1999."
"I also think that this programme, which is aimed at supporting and supplementing the efforts of the Member States in the area of civil protection, is an important one, and it is important to make it as effective as possible."
"Twenty-three amendments have been tabled, of which the Commission is able to accept 14."
"We believe that they help to improve the text and also to clarify it."
"Some of the amendments emphasise the gaining of experience, which forms part of the basic principles of the programme. Some call for greater involvement of the public and NGOs, and then there are some which strengthen the environmental aspects."
"We are therefore able to accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18 and 22."
"Finally there is Amendment No 23, which is acceptable in part, and Amendment No 19, which is acceptable in principle."
"Amendment No 19 and parts of Amendment No 23 are aimed at increasing the involvement of NGOs in civil protection, which is something I naturally agree with, and so I also accept this in principle because it gives NGOs the opportunity to participate in the exchange of expertise."
"Then there are a number of amendments which we are not so happy with."
"These are Amendments Nos 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20, 21 and 24."
"I recognise that some of them attempt to improve cooperation with countries participating in the PHARE, TACIS and MEDA programmes."
"That is of course an objective which commands a great deal of sympathy, but where civil protection is concerned, such cooperation is organised outside our action programme."
"At the moment, two projects are being carried out under PHARE and MEDA, and a third, which may be financed through TACIS, is in preparation."
"I would also like to draw attention to the second part of Amendment No 20, because there it says that, if isolated regions are involved, the maximum financial contribution for pilot projects should be up to 100 %, instead of the 50 % proposed by the Commission."
"It is our firm belief that responsible budget management also requires joint financial responsibility on the part of the participants in the project, and so we cannot accept the amendment."
"Mrs González Álvarez also mentioned the question of the comments by the Committee on Budgets on the proportion of administrative costs in relation to the total operating budget, and Mrs González Álvarez made some very sensible remarks on that."
"In my department, we are currently in the process of examining this question, and it is of course important to ensure that these administrative costs are kept to a minimum when the programme is implemented."
"Finally, I hope that through its cooperation, Parliament will help to ensure that the proposal now before the House is adopted quickly, so as to ensure continuity between the Community's current action programme and the proposed programme, which is due to enter into force on 1 January 2000."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Pollution by agricultural tractors"
"The next item is the report (A4-0128/99) by Mr Fitzsimons, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on action to be taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants by engines intended to power agricultural or forestry tractors and amending Council Directive 74/150/EEC (COM(98)0472 - C4-0512/98-98/0247(COD))."
"Mr President, in the interests of brevity, and because of the heavy volume of plenary business we have dealt with this evening and the lateness of the hour, I propose to confine myself to a few pertinent remarks on my report, which was drawn up on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"It basically deals with agriculture and forestry pollution by agricultural and forestry tractors."
"As we all know to our cost, road traffic is increasing and with it air pollution."
"On a daily basis a potentially lethal cocktail of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and particulates assault our nostrils and our respiratory systems."
"So the European Union has come up with measures to curb road vehicle emissions."
"These are being refined and added to as technical and scientific knowledge advances."
"However, further studies have emerged which establish very clearly that emissions generated by off-road mobile machinery and by agricultural or forestry tractors also add significantly to air pollution."
"So this proposal for a directive on action to be taken against pollutants from engines for tractors follows the lines of the 1997 directive on emissions from engines in off-road mobile machinery."
"The proposed directive aims to help both the industry and the user, so it is certainly not anti-user or anti-farmer in any way."
"It seeks to offer a compromise between having uniform requirements on the one hand and facilitating European Union access to world markets by aligning European Union industrial specifications to the broader requirements set out in the 1995 United Nations Regulation of the Economic Committee for Europe."
"I would ask you to support this report."
"It basically endorses the Commission's position in the draft proposals."
"I apologise to the Commissioners for bringing them in at this late hour of the night."
"I should like to thank the members of the Environment Committee for the support they have already given to my report in committee."
"As ever their comments were constructive and helpful."
"The Environment Committee has made its presence felt in the increasingly important area of environmental legislation and I know we will continue to do so."
"I hope my report on pollution by agricultural and forestry tractors, with Parliament's support, will make a further positive contribution to a cleaner and safer environment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, traffic is still an important source of air pollution."
"There are already European regulations with limit values for gaseous and particulate pollutants and corresponding test requirements and type-approval procedures for private motor vehicles, heavy goods vehicles and off-road mobile machinery."
"Nevertheless, since 1996 the European Parliament has also been calling for legal specifications for agricultural and forestry tractors."
"It certainly amounts to a success that we are discussing this today, as this regime will make an important contribution to environmental protection, and will also facilitate trade in tractors between the EU Member States, as well as making it easier for European manufacturers to access third country markets because of the equivalence that will be achieved between Community legislation and the technical requirements of UN/ECE Regulation No 96."
"Our group wishes to thank Mr Fitzsimons for his report on this very complicated and technical proposal and supports the amendments he has tabled."
"Finally, I have a question for the officiating Commissioner, as Council Directive 77/537 relating to emissions from agricultural and forestry tractors remains in force."
"This, however, uses a different reference fuel for emissions testing than the directive before us."
"Could you therefore confirm that this discrepancy still exists and above all whether it is not in fact necessary to bring the 1977 directive into line with the new legislation on fuel quality?"
"Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fitzsimons, not only for his work on the report itself but also for the very precise presentation he has made this evening."
"We set limit values for emissions from the engines of mobile machinery and equipment in general back in March 1998, and our objective now is to lay down limit values for agricultural tractors as well."
"This would apply by extension to the test requirements for reducing emissions, enabling us to achieve equivalence with other legislation already in force."
"Parliament has tabled five amendments."
"We can accept Amendments Nos 1 and 3, but not Amendment No 2, which suggests that the Commission should present a further proposal in 2002 tightening the limit values."
"We regard that as both unnecessary and unacceptable, as the limit values enshrined in this directive would only just have been transposed by the Member States at that point."
"It should also be borne in mind that the timetable for implementing the limit values in this directive is intended to run parallel with the timetable for the directive on mobile machinery and equipment, that is in 2004."
"Furthermore, if we are to tighten up limit values, we must take account of available technology and above all of the cost/benefit principle recognised by Parliament, which forms part of all our proposals for environmental measures."
"That means that we cannot just pluck a statement out of thin air and say that we will tighten these up further."
"Amendment No 4 is also unacceptable."
"It concerns bringing requirements into line with technical progress under Framework Directive 74/150."
"That directive is at present being totally reworked."
"I do not therefore feel that it is right now to make and accept proposals for amendments in individual directives."
"Amendment No 5 is also unacceptable to us."
"Nor does it make sense any more, as the present Commission proposal very precisely adopts both Stage 1 and Stage 2 of Directive 97/68 on emissions from the engines of mobile machinery and equipment."
"So this amendment has really become superfluous."
"As to the question that Mrs Schleicher asked, I do not know who it was directed at, but I am here as an acting Commissioner."
"I am not an officiating Commissioner, that is quite wrong!"
"Since its resignation the Commission has continued to be fully active in all its rights and duties, and that applies to me also."
"So I am not sure if your question was meant for me, but I will assume it is."
"There are two sides to this question: first, the issue of type-approval, concerning what such regulations on fuels apply to, and second, the issue of checking whether these regulations are observed in practice."
"We consider that the Member States have applied type-approval in accordance with good practice up to now, and we will have to find a reasonable system of checking practice in future."
"Of course we may also have to take other fuels into account, as these fuel values are applied in practice."
"Type-approval may mean coming up with other fuel values."
"You will see from all this that the Commission is not officiating, but that it is very much present in spirit."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses"
"The next item is the report (A4-0225/99) by Mrs Sandbæk, on behalf of the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses (3607/99 - C4-0154/99-94/0076(COD))."
"Mr President, as you know, the European Council meeting in Edinburgh called for a simplification of EU legislation."
"That has only happened to a very small extent."
"But it is at any rate welcome that the Council has reduced the original list of nine categories of foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses to five specific directives."
"The list should have been just four, because in its opinion at first reading, Parliament quite rightly found that there were no grounds for drawing up a specific directive on foods for sportsmen."
"For us to be able to define a food as intended for a particular nutritional use, it should fulfil particular nutritional needs for certain categories of persons who cannot eat ordinary food, either because there is something wrong with their digestion or metabolism, or because in a particular physiological condition they can derive particular benefit from the controlled intake of certain substances in their food."
"Infants and young children are one category, but sportsmen hardly fit into this definition."
"And there is a fear that ordinary foods with special characteristics which are particularly suitable for sportsmen, such as pasta and various drinks, will be brought into the specific directive. This would create confusion for consumers and directly work against the simplification of rules which the directive is intended to encourage."
"The interests of industry appear to have weighed more heavily than those of consumers when the Council insisted on this entirely superfluous directive."
"The opposite should of course have been the case, so that consideration for consumers was the decisive factor."
"In this respect, I am pleased that the Council has put on hold the question of a specific directive on foods for diabetics."
"My colleagues in Parliament wanted this directive, but I think that in this case we should listen to the diabetics' organisations, which have expressed the unanimous opinion that the marketing of and easy access to diabetic products creates a false demand among diabetics."
"In fact, diabetic products have no place in the modern treatment of diabetes."
"They contain a high level of harmful fats, have inadequate labelling and typically cost up to 400 % more than ordinary foods, which is a completely unnecessary and unreasonable burden to put on diabetics."
"What is needed is sensible information and a proper and, most importantly, individually worked-out diet."
"The result of the Council's compromise, which is to obtain an opinion from the Scientific Committee for Food, will hopefully be that no directive is drawn up."
"And so to the specific directive on baby foods, which is the reason why the adoption of the framework directive is taking so long."
"I would first and foremost like to congratulate Mrs Breyer for proposing and insisting on the amendment requiring baby food products to be pesticide-free in order to be covered by the directive."
"I must admit that at the second reading of the framework directive, I agreed with the Council that the framework directive was not the right place for the specific directive's provisions on pesticide levels in baby food, although I of course agreed entirely with Mrs Breyer that baby food should be pesticide-free."
"Nonetheless, thanks to Mrs Breyer's amendment, Parliament has succeeded in putting pressure on both the Commission and the Food Committee."
"The long conciliation procedure we have been through has had a decisive influence on the fact that the maximum level for pesticides in baby food has been set at 0.01 mg/kg, which means in practice pesticide-free baby food, because it is not possible to measure any lower levels."
"In practice, if the provisions of the directive are to be met, it will only be possible to use organic products in baby food."
"Hopefully, the next step will be for the EU therefore also to improve the opportunities for organic farmers to produce the necessary products in a competitive way, which is something Agenda 2000 unfortunately does not do."
"The handling of some of the specific directives which have already been issued has been rather problematic."
"The directive on baby food is a welcome exception."
"It should lead us in Parliament to realise that directives of a technical nature may also have a political content which cannot be left to a committee of experts."
"I hope that on Thursday, Parliament will adopt the Aglietta report on the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission, so that the baby food success story can be followed by many others."
"In any event, adopting this directive in accordance with the Conciliation Committee's joint text will be a good start."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there remain a great many important issues to be discussed this week in Parliament: the nomination of the new Commission President, Mr Prodi, Agenda 2000 and many more besides."
"The framework directive on dietetic foods does not appear to be the most important issue here, as is evident, moreover, by the number of Members present."
"However, I believe that there are some important points which need to be addressed here. Mrs Sandbæk has already addressed the particularly contentious issue of pesticides in baby foods; this issue concerns the health of babies and small children."
"I believe that the public would not understand it if Europe agreed to reduce this issue to its lowest common denominator; what is important here is the precautionary principle."
"As Members of Parliament, we have always insisted on this precautionary principle and stated that pesticides have no business being in baby foods, and we have also made this clear by means of an amendment."
"I am very satisfied with the outcome of the conciliation procedure - as is my group - since this principle was adopted in the course of the conciliation procedure, obviously not as part of the conciliation procedure, but politically as part of the negotiations."
"I should like to reiterate clearly that as Members of Parliament we have relied on scientific opinion whatever the issue, such as the opinions expressed by ESPEGAM, for example, which has clearly stated that as long as there is no ADI for infants, an extremely strict value of virtually zero needs to be set."
"I should like to thank the Commission which - I want to get this right - has resigned, but which is still in office."
"It has not been an easy time."
"I think that, exceptionally, Mr Bangemann can also be singled out on this issue for having supported the campaign for consumer protection."
"I regret the fact that he initially experienced so much resistance within the Commission, particularly from Mrs Bonino, who should in fact have supported consumer protection."
"However, a happy outcome is worth waiting for."
"We have obtained a good result, and we shall be able to give our assent tomorrow."
"Mr President, we shall also be giving our assent tomorrow."
"I was very pleased that Mrs Sandbæk also reiterated that it was the amendment tabled by the Greens which provided that baby foods should in future be pesticide-free."
"I think that this is a great victory for consumer protection, and it contributes in a significant way to making agricultural policy more environmentally friendly."
"We have proved with this decision that we can succeed in making the highest standards, namely the no-trace limit value already in force in Germany - a standard for the whole of the EU."
"We can now only hope that the manufacturers of baby foods in the EU make the necessary adjustments quickly, since it is clear that baby foods must be free of all poisonous substances."
"Harmonisation in this area really cannot be reduced to the lowest common denominator; instead, we must demonstrate the highest degree of precaution and duty of care towards the youngest members of our society."
"However, we hope that this will now also be the starting point for an initiative against the ADI concept for all foodstuffs, particularly those for school children and young people, since it in fact refers to the recommended intake of pesticides for an adult."
"It is not only babies who absorb on average much more per kilo of body weight, but also school children and young people."
"I now think that we must start to reconsider the whole ADI concept, and we must build on this success in an attempt to extend it in future to school children and young people, since it has been proven that even the minutest quantities of pesticide can result in serious illness, particularly among children."
"Mr President, I should firstly also like to express my thanks to the rapporteur."
"We had been instructed by the European Council to reduce the number of acts governing dietetic foods."
"We have not managed to do this now because we have two more, but at least we have achieved a certain degree of clarification."
"I am being quite frank with you when I say - and you already know this from previous debates - that I would have preferred it if we could at least have done without the directive on foods for sportsmen; this is more likely to result in misinformation in any case, especially as it will be very difficult to obtain clear provisions for the different types of sport because the foodstuffs that can be recommended or are important for a certain type of sport vary considerably from sport to sport."
"But I do not believe that it would be right to reject the outcome of conciliation on this issue or on account of this issue."
"On the question of pesticide residues in baby foods, the Commission has taken a very clear position which corresponds exactly to the one we eventually adopted on this."
"The only difference was whether this should be laid down in the specific directive or the framework directive."
"Nonetheless, we agreed on the general and practical issues."
"Admittedly, there was discussion within the Commission, but such discussions take place often anyway."
"After all, it is also a fact that not all Commissioners can be of the same opinion from the start."
"However, we managed to agree that special consideration of the precautionary principle is appropriate for babies and toddlers."
"That is to say, the very low level of pesticide residues will apply - this has been proposed by us, and will be adopted - even though the results of scientific research are not available yet in all cases or for all pesticides."
"We have therefore abandoned our usual position on this point, although we will still keep to it in the future, unless really strong grounds exist for proceeding only on the basis of the precautionary principle without scientific findings. This means that we will still aim to base our legislative measures on scientific findings."
"I still consider this to be the correct approach; otherwise, we would be in a state of confusion which would not be helpful to consumers either, since it results in arbitrary action which is also not the way to help consumers."
"I should therefore like to reiterate - this holds true for the present Commission and I hope it will also hold true for the next one - that if we cease to base our decisions on the results of scientific research, then we will open the floodgates to all types of decisions being taken, and we will basically no longer be able to explain why a decision has been taken."
"The precautionary principle, whereby the results of scientific research can be ignored, or results can be achieved without them, is clearly an exception to the rule in this case. The Commission has also supported this, but we cannot make it the norm."
"I would point this out to Mrs Breyer."
"She is starting now with school children. Then come those reaching the age of puberty, for whom it is particularly important not to be exposed to any danger whatsoever."
"Then come those in their twenties who suffer from not being able to go to discos any more, and then those up to the age of forty."
"Then, for those aged over forty, the dilemma is the same as for babies."
"They have to be protected against everything."
"Mrs Breyer, the Commission will not support you on this."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"New codecision procedure"
"The next item is the report (A4-0206/99) by Mr Manzella, on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, on the joint declaration on practical arrangements for the new codecision procedure (Article 251 EC)."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by presenting the apologies of the rapporteur who could not be with us tonight."
"It is quite well known now that the Amsterdam Treaty extends the codecision procedure from some 15 articles to 38 articles under the Treaty, so that most non-agricultural legislation will be subject to codecision."
"This actually changes the legislative authority of the European Union into a real bicameral legislative authority."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam also changes the procedure itself, and that is less well known, to provide for absolute equality between Parliament and the Council throughout the procedure."
"Something that was first thought of by yourself, Mr President, when you worked on the Martin reports."
"I had the privilege of working with you in those days on that."
"The first drafts were made of a possible future codecision procedure, always envisaging equality between Parliament and the Council."
"Now we have that for most legislation."
"That is very important."
"It means that to be adopted European legislation now has to pass two hurdles, two tests as to the quality and the acceptability of such legislation."
"It must be acceptable to a majority of the elected governments sitting in the Council and a majority of the directly elected MEPs in Parliament."
"Parliament brings greater diversity to the examination of European legislation."
"After all, in Parliament you have not just government ministers coming from their national capitals but also elected representatives from all the regions of all the Member States, from governing and opposition parties in their full diversity and plurality."
"Imagine for one moment the European system without the European Parliament."
"It would be totally dominated by diplomats, technocrats and bureaucrats, with ministers occasionally flying into Brussels to try and keep track of what is happening."
"The fact that you have at the heart of the decision-taking system a body of full-time representatives in that full diversity that they represent, knocking on doors, making phone calls, asking awkward questions, probing, questioning, going through matters in detail and going back to their regions to talk about it with interest groups, trade unions, employers, consumer groups and local governments in their regions."
"That is what brings full pluralism, diversity, openness and democracy to the European system."
"Recognising that now by giving Parliament equal status with the Council in the codecision procedure, is a tremendous step forward for the European Union."
"The changes which were made to the old procedure are threefold: the elimination of the so-called negative version of the third reading, whereby if there was no agreement in conciliation the Council could go ahead and adopt its own text and challenge Parliament to reject that by an absolute majority within six weeks."
"That unbalanced the procedure in favour of the Council, even if it was rarely used - the Council only tried it once, we rejected it and the Council never tried it again."
"Nonetheless, it was an unhealthy part of the procedure."
"That goes with Amsterdam - full equality, therefore."
"Simple rejection by Parliament when we are opposed to a text instead of a two-phased rejection is now possible under the Amsterdam Treaty - simpler, easier and puts Parliament in a stronger position."
"Thirdly, the possibility for first-reading agreements."
"These changes, as I said, put us in a position of equality but they also necessitated a revision of the 1993 agreement on the operation of the procedure."
"I am very pleased - and I must congratulate Vice-Presidents Imbeni, Fontaine and Verde, Ken Collins, De Giovanni and the rapporteur whom I am replacing, on the text they have negotiated with the other institutions."
"It is a good text: practical and flexible."
"It goes beyond the 1993 text, which was limited to conciliation: it covers the whole codecision procedure in full."
"Let us not forget that most codecisions result in agreement without needing the Conciliation Committee, so it is very important that has been brought into the text."
"It recognises the practice that the negotiations do not take place 15 plus 15 but in a smaller group: the committee chair and rapporteur with the Council President and the Commission, then reporting back to the full Conciliation Committee."
"It allows for first-reading agreements and it tries to draw the Council into a dialogue with us in the first reading, as we have recently done in our new Rules of Procedure as well to encourage that sort of dialogue at an early stage."
"Finally, but above all, right the way through the text it recognises the equality of Parliament and the Council: the committee is to be chaired jointly; it will meet alternately on Council premises and on Parliament premises; texts have to be signed jointly by the two chairmen; letters have to be signed by the two chairmen; even the juridical linguistic review by the staff will now be jointly between Parliament and the Council."
"All this recognises the equality of the two institutions and, as I said earlier, sets up this new era where we are two parts of a bicameral legislative authority at European level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Corbett is not only due credit for having done such an excellent job in taking over from the original rapporteur; he has also described in great detail the practical developments and progress made on the codecision procedure, which forms the basis of this report."
"I do not want to go into this now, though I would like to take the opportunity to point out one thing: however much we have progressed as a result of Amsterdam on the practical aspects of parliamentarianism, we must nevertheless not overlook the fact that important elements which constitute genuine parliamentary government are still absent in the European Union."
"I am thinking of the third pillar, which is particularly important for human rights and the nation state, and on which there is admittedly a timetable due to the Treaty, but the political discussion about giving Parliament greater powers in the third pillar is in fact lacking."
"Moreover, it should be mentioned that our Member States still consider it unreasonable to subject agricultural policy to a decision by Parliament, particularly in the area of the budget, and our power of codecision is still very much underdeveloped when it comes to amending the Treaty."
"I just wanted to mention these points because they are important to me."
"We want a strong European Union with a strong Commission and Parliament, since this is what guarantees a democratic European Union."
"A powerful European Union can only be a democratic one, and we must therefore continue our efforts to give Parliament greater powers in the European Union and not give up on this."
"This should also be mentioned briefly on this occasion."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is fortunate, as Mr Corbett pointed out earlier, that this sitting is being chaired by Mr Martin as he is a great expert on institutional issues."
"All of us that have worked with him over the years have benefited from his experience and I personally have benefited from that wonderful report he presented during the parliamentary term that began in 1989. This is why I should like to pay homage to him now."
"I should also like to congratulate Mr Manzella and Mr Corbett as well as the negotiators from the three institutions on their excellent work and on having been able to strike a balance between a dynamic application of the provisions and the obligation to fully respect the Treaty."
"The working methods formally approved and adopted by the Commission seem particularly useful for several reasons."
"First, they offer the institutions the opportunity to conclude any legislative codecision procedure at first reading, as provided for in the Treaty, provided they have reached an agreement, as is only logical."
"It is precisely during this first stage that the institutions can fully exercise their powers."
"Second, the Commission participates fully throughout the procedure and, in particular, can play an important role as mediator during the conciliation phase."
"In my view, its responsibility in this area should be enhanced in the future."
"And lastly, I believe that the key to success in developing the legislative procedure lies in close and flexible interinstitutional cooperation."
"Moreover, with the application of the new Treaty, this agreement marks the end of what could be termed a test or trial period for the codecision procedure and Parliament's role as a co-legislator."
"The success of the codecision procedure in the first years of its application was a clear signal to the last Intergovernmental Conference that it should be extended to cover almost all the main legislative activities."
"Codecision has now become the general rule and Parliament's role as a co-legislator has been consolidated."
"I think we should be pleased in this respect because democracy has, in fact, been strengthened as a result."
"As regards the codecision procedure in the Amsterdam Treaty, we should firstly look at the possibility of concluding the legislative procedure at first reading in a positive light."
"This should speed up legislative decision-making and, as a consequence, enable us to advance along the road mapped out by the institutions following the Single European Act."
"In spite of the exceptions which still exist, the duration of the Union's legislative procedures is quite reasonable, generally speaking, particularly if we compare it to national procedures."
"Sometimes the European Parliament works even faster."
"Secondly, as regards conciliation, it is important to emphasise that the procedures have been streamlined."
"Should Parliament and the Council fail to reach agreement, the draft lapses."
"This confirms the European Parliament's responsibility and prevents totally futile disputes between the two institutions."
"Furthermore, in practice we can see that the clause that provided the Council with a last attempt to overcome the European Parliament's opposition has never been seriously used."
"In this way, we also wanted to put an end to the lack of confidence surrounding the European Parliament's decision-making abilities, which centred mainly on bureaucracy."
"Finally, the end of small-scale conciliation is absolutely vital to the process of simplification."
"Similarly, the possibility of inviting the European Parliament to hold a debate before finally rejecting a proposal is no longer essential given that the political debate among the political groups and the institutions can begin at first reading."
"I nonetheless believe that a key element of the reform is the extension of the range of issues that come under the codecision procedure."
"I do not know if such an extension is sufficient or incomplete, and I feel it may be necessary to go further in certain areas."
"What is vital in my view is to accept the Commission's proposal that states that no legislative act can be adopted in the Community without the European Parliament's approval."
"The new Treaty confirms that, in principle, the areas in which codecision is not the general rule are exceptions to the system."
"So the future Parliament is faced with a legislative task that entails greater responsibility."
"At the same time, the political debate is being stepped up and this should increase the public's confidence in the institutions, which is essential at this moment in time."
"The Commission approved the text of the joint declaration in its meeting of 9 March and the Council approved it last week."
"It is now Parliament's turn to add its support so as to enable the three Presidents to confirm the agreement of their institutions in a joint declaration at a signing ceremony this week."
"Therefore, on behalf of the Commission, I would ask you to agree to this declaration."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I must say that the symmetry of the committee chairman, the rapporteur and the secretariat all being involved ten years later in this debate has a certain appeal to me."
"On behalf of the House I should like to place on record my thanks to you for the work you have done both as a Member of this House and as Commissioner."
"It has been much appreciated."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The sitting was closed at 11.44 p.m."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I would like to make a point regarding a letter I received from the President's office on 20 April in response to a request for information on the procedures followed in relation to the petition forwarded by the spokesman for the Areeta residents' united platform in the province of Álava."
"I was born there and still live there, which is why I am very interested in this matter. This document was included in the European Parliament's list of documents received on 12 April and I was informed that it was to be officially announced at the beginning of Parliament's sitting on 3 May, that is, the day before yesterday."
"I have checked the Minutes from Monday and Tuesday, but this document does not appear in either of them."
"Some might say that this is not an important issue, but such matters are very sensitive in communities that are undergoing restructuring. The town involved has spent the last four years campaigning to have the area's sewage treatment plant moved two or three kilometres away in order to get rid of the bad smell."
"It is a sensitive petition and I feel that the correct procedures should have been followed."
"I would ask the President to kindly ensure that this reasonable and just petition is advanced as soon as possible."
"Thank you, Mr Valdivielso."
"We shall check on all the details of the matter you have raised."
"Mr President, I received a letter from your office which said that, as there was to be a debate on Kosovo yesterday afternoon, the questions to the Council that I and other colleagues had tabled for this afternoon would not be discussed."
"Firstly, we did not manage to get speaking time from our group to present the question during yesterday's debate.-Secondly, as you will see from the Minutes, the issues we were asking about were not covered during yesterday's debate either by the Foreign Minister, Mr Fischer, or by Commissioner van den Broek.Our question concerned the environmental impact, and the impact on public health, of the bombardments taking place in Kosovo. I would be very grateful if my question and the questions of my colleagues, which are of course related, could be discussed this afternoon in the Council, as originally planned."
"Thank you very much, Mr President. I hope my request will be granted."
"Mr Trakatellis, according to paragraph 2 of Annex II, Part A, a question shall be inadmissible if the agenda already provides for the subject to be discussed with the participation of the institution concerned, in this case the Council."
"The issue of Kosovo is included as one of the subjects in the topical and urgent debate. As a result, we cannot accept any questions relating to Kosovo during this sitting, as has been the case in other sittings, for the simple reason that the Rules do not allow it."
"Mr President, as you know, Members of this Parliament have, over the years, been extremely critical of any kind of censorship, in particular cultural censorship."
"They have also been very strongly supportive of gay rights."
"I should like to know why an exhibition by a lesbian artist was banned from this Parliament."
"This is a very crude form of censorship, there is no justification for it and I should like to know what part you played in banning this exhibition."
"At the end of the 20th century to ban an exhibition by a gay artist is completely unacceptable and no Member of this Parliament should endorse that."
"Mrs McKenna, I already explained to you on Monday that this decision was taken by the Quaestors, who followed the recommendation of the services responsible."
"The decision had nothing to do with whether or not the artist was a lesbian - I do not know if she is or not - but with the fact that it was felt that the content of the exhibition would have been offensive to some Members and some of the people passing through Parliament."
"That is why we refused to host it."
"Mr President, going back to the same question regarding the possible use of depleted uranium in Serbia and Kosovo, a specific question was asked to go on the agenda of Question Time, a specific question, not a general point as we had yesterday from the President-in-Office of the Council."
"The question regarding the use of depleted uranium oxide in Kosovo or Serbia was not addressed."
"Therefore, can you reassure us that we will be given the opportunity to receive some answer on this very vital question?"
"You know perfectly well that these have to be written questions."
"What I can do is have an oral question in this session because we have the subject of Kosovo on the agenda."
"You could have asked the Members who spoke in the name of your group to raise the question."
"If they do not deem it necessary to do so I cannot make any other arrangements."
"The Minutes were approved"
"Statement by the President of the European Parliament on the occasionof the conclusion of Parliament's fourth term of office"
"Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, this week's part-session is the last in our term of office and my last as President of this House."
"It is therefore time to give credit where it is due: to you, ladies and gentlemen, and, through you, to all the people of the European Union whom I have endeavoured to serve during the last two and a half years."
"In the letter I sent to you in December 1996 asking for your vote, I spoke of five challenges the Union, and therefore its Parliament, would have to face: five major challenges to be met in two and a half years."
"The first was the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, which was underway at the time and from which Parliament emerged a winner, with greater powers and in a stronger position to serve the people of Europe better."
"Parliament has promoted these negotiations energetically and is continuing to pay careful attention to them. We hope to ensure that all the applicant countries are included in the process, with the only differences arising from the rate at which each country adapts."
"We participated actively and constructively in this process, ensuring that the transition to the new currency did not take place at the expense of consumers. We also wanted to guarantee that the new directives for the European Central Bank were given the necessary preparation and independence, and that this House, which represents all Europeans, received adequate information on monetary policy."
"Fourthly, the financial perspectives and Agenda 2000 had to be reviewed. We contributed to this decisively through proposals and amendments aimed at maintaining and improving our common acquis ."
"In my view, the coordination of the work of the many committees involved and the cooperation with the Council and the Commission have been of the highest order."
"Our final objective was to prepare our institution for the coming European elections. These elections are not a matter of electing the poor relative of the Community institutions but of electing a Parliament that the people see for the first time as a Parliament that has great power and the ability to exercise that power."
"The balance between the European institutions has, in fact, changed to become what was intended in the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties: the appointment of the Commission and its political activities are no longer dependent on the confidence of the Council alone, they also depend - and this is crucial - on the confidence of Parliament."
"This confidence is not something that can be earned once and for all. The Commission must maintain this confidence right through its term of office and it must answer to Parliament when necessary, providing - without any reservations or reluctance - all the information the House needs to enable it to carry out its supervisory role."
"For years, there have been calls for more democratic European institutions."
"We must not lose our nerve or seek a return to the previous balance between the institutions: that is of no use any longer."
"Democracy means having to be the channel for the European public's growing demand for information, and to welcome or condemn what is being done in each case."
"This, rather than anything else, is what Parliament has done."
"In my letter of nomination, I also talked about internal reforms and the uniform Statute for Members."
"Many reforms have been adopted in the last few years in relation to the way in which our House works:"
"we have improved our standards and financial organisation; -we have completely changed the top levels of Parliament's administration and introduced new systems of promotion and mobility at all levels; -we have increased the number of women in senior posts, although we have not yet reached the levels I would have liked; -we have regulated the transparency of administrative decisions, at the request of the Ombudsman; -we have brought together and clarified the existing rules so that, from now on, both Members and officials will be aware of their rights and obligations, according to clear rules that prevent arbitrary behaviour or favouritism.We also managed to find a satisfactory solution to the technical and financial problems surrounding our buildings in Brussels, thereby completing the efforts of my predecessors to provide Members with more functional and compact facilities."
"I hope that the same can happen with the building in Strasbourg and that work on that can begin during the next term of office."
"This recent stability in terms of real estate policy has allowed us to provide Members with new computer programmes and resources that make it easier for them to have direct contact with the people."
"As regards the Statute for Members, I want to make it very clear that this is an ambition of Parliament and is in no way a discipline imposed by the Council, as some people claim. That is why I wanted to remind you that it was included in my letter."
"It was Parliament that asked for the legal basis for the Statute to be included in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and this request was met."
"It was also Parliament that presented the Council with a very comprehensive text, even before the Treaty entered into force, covering all the aspects of our situation as transparently as possible, even those aspects where it has always been our responsibility to take decisions."
"We must welcome the fact that the Council has joined in with this movement - which is in my view unstoppable - and has made great efforts to reach a consensus among its members. But some parts of the text proposed need to be corrected in terms of their form or substance so as to ensure that fundamental principles are not violated."
"I am thinking here of the principle of fiscal equality among all Members: temporary exceptions may be permitted but never permanent ones."
"In any event, it is clear that we will continue to call for a uniform statute, we have gone ahead and adopted measures to control our allowances and travelling expenses and significantly reduce them without waiting for the Statute to be introduced."
"Few institutions or bodies - national or otherwise - within this Union are capable of taking such decisions on their own initiative, as we have done."
"The basic aim of all these reforms was, and is - and the people should be aware of this - to increase the efficiency and transparency of Parliament. We hope to pass on to the incoming Members a House that is ready to face up to its institutional role and the challenge presented by greater awareness on the part of our fellow citizens."
"All in all, the results over the last two and a half years have been positive."
"However, there have been both successes and failures along the way."
"It would be remiss of me to overlook our most distressing failure: our inability to ensure that our repeated warnings about the approaching tragedy in Kosovo were heeded."
"Now we are having to watch with horror as the black clouds of hatred we warned of rain down persecution, blood and violence."
"We are having to watch how the absence of adequate instruments to implement peace there has left us powerless to prevent an act of genocide."
"We can, however, throw ourselves into helping the victims."
"This is what we are doing and we will have to continue our humanitarian work for a very long time."
"But it is not enough."
"We must now begin to pave the way for peace and to collaborate with the countries in the region to build a stable system of cooperation between them and promote development so that they can join our Union as soon as possible, a Union that is based on respect for differences and on the integration of its wealth and its cultural and human diversity."
"It is a Union where there can be no room for exclusive attitudes or racism and xenophobia."
"These evils always have a tendency to sprout new shoots, and we can never let up in the fight against them because, given the slightest opportunity, they can so easily turn into violence, suffering and death."
"Parliament has been - and will undoubtedly continue to be - one of the most active participants in this struggle."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I began with a personal assessment and have ended up with a collective assessment of achievements that have come about as a result of your work, your determination and your sound judgement, as well as the active and loyal cooperation of all the staff of the Secretariat who provide the House with their services, the freelance workers, the parliamentary assistants and everyone else involved."
"I would ask you to give them a round of applause to express our recognition of their work and our gratitude."
"Applause"
"I think that we should give special recognition to our colleagues who are now moving on to new pastures in their political or personal lives."
"This House owes a great deal to their dedication and intelligence."
"They have helped build a more democratic Europe that is closer to the people and we should thank them for that."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have had the privilege of presiding over the work of this House in the firm belief that the best way of reducing the democratic deficit in the Union is by promoting this Parliament and raising awareness of it among the people of Europe."
"There can be no real democracy where there is no real parliament, nor can there be a real parliament if it does not cause the executive a certain amount of anxiety and inconvenience."
"As a result, there have been many moments of tension and many difficult negotiations throughout the last two and a half years."
"I have tried to face these with determination and with total dedication and effort, and without flinching when it has been necessary to defend Parliament's decisions and actions."
"On no occasion did I wonder whether or not other institutions would be pleased with the way I was defending Parliament;"
"I simply looked on it as my duty. When I was young, I was taught that that was the only way to act in politics with dignity, and I have tried not to forget that."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will finish as I began over two years ago, by thanking you for your support and also for your criticism."
"I consider myself to be a democrat and I therefore take such criticism as it is meant: as help rather than an insult."
"In my view, it is wise to listen to critics and ignore flatterers."
"I have been moved by the passion of Europe, which has allowed the utopia of fifty years ago to become, for the most part, a reality."
"We must continue to develop Europe with this same passion and increasing unity, prosperity, freedom and solidarity."
"Thank you very much."
"Loud applause"
"Mr President, I should like to thank you for this assessment which you have presented to Parliament."
"I believe we can safely say, as you emphasised, that in the course of this term the House has developed into a genuine Parliament."
"The major achievement of your presidency is undoubtedly the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"It is thanks to your efforts, perseverance and credible convictions, coupled with the efforts of many Members, that Parliament won the right to genuine codecision in the legislative process."
"Everyone in this House knows that this would never have been achieved without your efforts."
"The European Parliament, our Parliament, has developed into a political institution whose voice within the European Union cannot be ignored and which has exercised its political and budgetary control with great authority and great independence."
"I consider this to be an exceptionally important development which also constitutes a democratic counterbalance to the European Union's other two political institutions."
"You carried through the parliamentary reforms which were initiated by your predecessor Klaus Hänsch, encountering many difficulties in the process."
"In many ways this was not an easy task, especially as the Council did not always fully understand the importance and complexity of the reforms and because - I believe - it was not sufficiently aware, particularly in the most recent period, that we could not allow certain principles of a free Parliament to be violated."
"The reforms have not actually been completed, which must have caused you some disappointment."
"But much more importantly than all of this I believe that you have acted out of your genuine belief in Europe rather than any kind of pragmatic Realpolitik."
"The European enterprise to bring peace, reconciliation and solidarity to the people of Europe is more than an ideal for you: it is your life's work."
"I should also like to add a personal element here."
"This conviction has been passed on from father to son."
"I shall never forget the time when, in the early 1970s, as the young chairman of my party, I attended a meeting with your father in a cinema in Madrid. Few people were present and the circumstances were not easy, but under your father's leadership we were even then able to clearly communicate the ideals and conviction of our beliefs, of the Christian Democratic values and principles and above all our belief in a federal Europe."
"You also embody these same principles."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there have been two Presidents during this parliamentary term, neither of whom, I believe, have held government office, but who worked and grew in stature here in Parliament."
"These two figures represented us with credibility and force before the Council."
"As prime minister of my country I noticed how the Presidents of Parliament were sometimes only allowed to attend the European Council for a few minutes."
"Fortunately this is no longer the case."
"Both of you, Klaus Hänsch and José Maria Gil-Robles, represented and defended our Parliament in a very credible manner and achieved some outstanding results."
"I should therefore like to thank you both personally."
"We remain true to the ideal."
"We will continue to work towards it, albeit in very different circumstances."
"My sincere thanks for all you have achieved."
"Applause"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I should like to join with Mr Martens in paying tribute to your work, to your profile and to your commitment as President of this Parliament over the last two and a half years."
"You have presided over one of the most extraordinary periods in the history of the European Union and the life of this Parliament, as you yourself said in your speech: going from the intergovernmental conference, through the introduction of the euro and indeed through the unexpected ratification process of the new Commission - that though we had not quite timetabled or expected it - has also been dealt with."
"The last six months have been the most tumultuous six months of the life of this Parliament."
"You, Mr President, have ensured that Parliament's role in this entire period has been clear and has been effective."
"I want to pay, in just a few words, particular tribute to your sensitivity and your human qualities, if I may."
"You have been accessible to Members of this Parliament."
"You opened your doors in a new and innovative way to backbenchers, as President of the House."
"That has been very much welcomed and respected by Members here."
"You have always been accessible, certainly to me, as leader of my group, when I have needed to talk or to see you, your door, or indeed your telephone, has always been accessible to me."
"I thank you personally for that."
"It has helped on occasion, as you know, to sort out or to ease certain issues and events through the life of this Parliament."
"I thank you on behalf of my group for that."
"You are leaving the presidency at the end of what I have already described as a tumultuous six months."
"Parliament's prestige is enhanced at the end of this period."
"It is a coincidence, but perhaps a fortunate one, that this very week when we are in the last week of the life of this House, we are also in the first week of the life of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"It is fitting that it should be like that and we will notice the change to the rules that were made to bring in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Yesterday, for instance, during the vote, 39 reports were dealt with in one and a half hours which is probably something of a record."
"I thank you, Mr President, for your role and the work you have done and would just like to join Mr Martens in saying that you are indeed a thoughtful, deeply committed and heartfelt European."
"Applause"
"Mr President, on behalf of the ELDR Group I too want to be associated with the words of thanks to you for your term of office."
"It has been - indeed, even as we finish it - and remains an extraordinary and eventful term."
"It represents a term when European democracy itself, when parliamentary democracy has reached a new level of maturity."
"In some ways, as we enter, in terms of direct mandates, our twenty-first year we have now achieved this new age of maturity."
"I believe, with your help, particularly when we have dealt with many of the sensitive political controversies of recent months and the Conference of Presidents, we have been able to hold together, with the stresses and strains and points of emphasis that groups may wish to bring to debates, a coherent parliamentary view."
"That is in no small measure a result of your role in the Chair."
"I am aware also, of the extent to which, in your many years of service in this House, you personally were committed to issues of institutional reform."
"Therefore it must be an issue of great personal satisfaction that, having given so much of your particular attention to institutional matters, you should preside over this last session under the new Treaty of Amsterdam."
"I can confirm in the several months that I have had the privilege of leading my own group the courtesy which you have shown to me - which I acknowledge here today - and also confirm the extraordinary openness with which you do your business."
"You are a frank and decent man to deal with."
"I deeply appreciate the openness you have shown to me when I have needed your advice and assistance."
"May your future go well."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I am very pleased to be able to speak at the end of our term of office, which is beginning to seem like the end of the academic year, when students finish their university classes and pleasantly say goodbye to each other, remembering certain students and teachers, and there is a generally friendly atmosphere."
"I am glad there are days like this when the heart rules."
"I must admit that I completely forgot about this formal sitting. As a result, what I am saying to the House on a personal level has not gone through any political filter, and at the moment I have to say that I would vote for both you and Mr Hänsch again."
"This does not always happen."
"My group asked for a political assessment and, despite all the criticisms we have made, the work of the various political groups throughout this term of office has been very valuable."
"I would like to stress three aspects of your work."
"The first is your efficiency, which meant that you had to make yourself available at all times."
"The second aspect is your complete independence from possible pressure from governments and parties, and this is vital."
"You gave priority to your role as President of Parliament."
"Undoubtedly, there were ups and downs, but I will not go into them here."
"However, it is not easy to fulfill the institutional role to which you were elected with complete independence every day, Mr President, and I thank you for this."
"I am a member of a medium-sized group - it is certainly not small, since 34 Members constitute a medium to large group - and I have to say that we have never noticed any discrimination."
"You have treated all the groups in exactly the same way, according, of course, to our degree of support among the people."
"As far as Parliament is concerned, I think it is fair to say that the dominant feature of our term of office has been that we have left behind our short trousers. Being a man I am using the example of short trousers, though of course I do not mean to be in any way sexist."
"We are now an adult Parliament."
"We no longer need to set out Parliament's responsibilities over and over again."
"The public are aware that this is a Parliament of truth."
"They are more aware of that than they are of the Treaty of Amsterdam, since, as a Spanish journalist said, the Treaty is colourless, odourless and bland."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam does not attract much attention, although we are very much aware of it in Parliament because of our legislative work."
"The fact that we have now become a mature and adult Parliament is very important for democracy, as democracy cannot work on the basis of good intentions or personal contributions alone, as we all know. It requires institutions that go further than human beings, that ensure that the work of Members who are not returning will be continued by other Members."
"That is the greatest merit of the institutions of democracy."
"Parliament has often been critical of and hard on the Commission."
"Mr Santer is here today and I would like to express my own personal gratitude to him."
"We must thank Mr Santer for accepting Parliament's role."
"And here I am also thinking about the future, when one day the Council too - the omnipotent Council - will have to come before Parliament to face up to its political responsibilities and account for certain decisions."
"When that happens, Parliament will have fully come of age to the benefit of the people of Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again I will have to represent our group because I am the only coordinator here present."
"And I am happy to do so."
"But let me say in advance that I come from Schleswig-Holstein and am also a Green, both of which make it difficult for me - unlike Mr Puerta who is so extremely good at it - to utter the usual words of praise."
"It is not the custom where I come from, nor is it the custom in my party!"
"Mr President, I think I can assure you that we all have great respect for you."
"We really have been most impressed by your composure, your ability to handle differences and opposed views, and I personally have learnt to value not just your sense of fairness but also your awareness of the growing tasks facing this House, for during this legislative term this House has grown at least a head taller."
"And perhaps we have got over the problem of the short trousers - you know an incident occurred during the Conference of Presidents, at which I appeared in short trousers."
"Everyone survived that with great composure too - after all, it was very hot!"
"Parliament really has gained in stature and weight now."
"We have achieved that under your presidency, Mr Gil-Robles."
"Heckling"
"I have not gained weight!"
"That is a misinterpretation."
"Laughter"
"We have gained in political weight."
"I do not think anyone here in the House can mistake that."
"You, Mr President, have been active in your office and really stood up for the equal rights of all Members; you took active and successful steps to ensure that we now obtain a common European statute instead of a medley of national statutes."
"One instead of 15, surely that is a qualitative step forward!"
"In that regard, and I do not think it is only my group that believes this, your term of office really was successful and you have done this Parliament great services."
"Muchas gracias, Señor Presidente !"
"Applause"
"Mr President, it is with the utmost pleasure, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, that I say a very sincere word of thanks to you for the very able leadership which you have given Parliament over the last two-and-a-half years."
"I do not wish to repeat what has been said by colleagues who have already spoken but it has been a very great two-and-a-half years."
"We will always remember Amsterdam; we will always remember the European single currency."
"We will also recognise and appreciate in the future the stronger and greater links that you have established with the applicant countries, helping to foster democratic and parliamentary values there."
"We will always remember you as a person who has shown very great leadership at all times and someone who was open, friendly and accessible to Members of Parliament."
"That is important."
"But above and beyond that it is recognised that you are a man of strong conviction with many natural human qualities; a person of great energy and determination and a person who has always been positive and even-handed; a person who is encouraging and indeed, a person who can be very firm and authoritative when that sort of authority needs to be shown, as we have witnessed on occasion."
"As well, we will always remember you as a person with a good sense of humour."
"That has helped on occasions, particularly at meetings of the Bureau when we were getting bogged down on sensitive matters and you never failed to see the wood for the trees."
"You always got us out at the end of the day."
"I thank you very sincerely for what you did in relation to bringing a greater degree of openness and transparency to the workings of this Parliament."
"This was essential."
"There was no way out of it; we had to face reality."
"You certainly played your part, following on from the very fine work done by your predecessor Mr Hänsch in ensuring that we could, at this particular time, be in a position to face the electorate in a way that we could withstand the criticisms and cynicisms that were going to be directed at us."
"I hope we can continue down that path despite the one or two problems that are there."
"In this regard I would say a special word of thanks and appreciation to the German presidency for the great work they did on the Statute and bringing us to where we are today."
"But for you, Mr President, for the presidency and Parliament helping, we would not be where we are."
"We still have that last furlong to travel."
"I hope that we get there."
"I believe you had a very successful term of office, Mr President."
"I thank you for it."
"You put tremendous effort into it."
"Parliament has responded to your leadership."
"Parliament is undoubtedly becoming more and more, as a result of your leadership, meaningful to the ordinary citizens of the Member States."
"That is something we must continue to achieve right up to the end."
"Mr President, I want to make a point of order that is a matter of form and will take only a moment."
"I have not been a Member long enough to know what Rule allows the French Socialists to join in the praise for your work on behalf of us all."
"But I felt I should do so, on the basis of whatever Rule Mr Fabre-Aubrespy would have found had he been here."
"Thank you, Mr Duhamel."
"Thank you to everyone for these kind words, which I truly appreciate."
"I shall continue to work in Parliament as a Member, and I can assure you that I shall continue to do so gladly with all of you, in the same spirit."
"Mr President, a word of thanks is most certainly also due from your ever-devoted, critical and constructive opposition."
"I too would like to say Gracias, Presidente on behalf of the Europe of Nations Group, and to acknowledge the fact that something happens to our Presidents when they are first elected."
"They suddenly change from being political opponents into cooperative, humorous, agreeable and impartial colleagues, and we really do have a very good, cooperative community within the bodies that control Parliament."
"And you are no exception in this respect."
"You have continued the work of Mr Hänsch, and I would very much like to thank you for that."
"I suppose that I can now be counted as one of the veterans of the House, and I can recall how at one time the political group chairmen would lead the way when it came to wasting expenses and being driven around in limousines with chauffeurs paid for by Parliament, while in the meantime travel refunds were being drawn from the Members' cash office for the same trips."
"That was not so many years ago, but now we have the opportunity to take stock, as it were, and to thank you for having helped, together with Mr Hänsch, to clean up this kind of waste."
"Since 1994, the President of Parliament has been at the forefront of the clean-up operation."
"We must thank Mr Hänsch, because he set this work in motion, and Mr Gil-Robles, since he continued it."
"But there was also a time when this House was a 'Mickey Mouse parliament' which acted most irresponsibly in financial matters."
"Thirty-eight times we have tabled a motion proposing that travel expenses should be based on receipts submitted."
"Hopefully this will now happen, but we must first get through an exercise this afternoon."
"Now all of the group chairmen are leading the way in the battle against abuse, whereas previously they were the leading abusers."
"So in this area at least, a change has taken place, but unfortunately the political group chairmen are still in the minority in this House."
"We shall see evidence of that this afternoon."
"Hopefully, the chairmen will get a majority behind them in the Parliament that emerges after 10 June, so that a clean-up can finally take place with regard to travel expenses, because we are certainly not there yet."
"The proposal which has been adopted in the Bureau means that for my journey from Copenhagen to Strasbourg, I get EUR 450 more in travel expenses than I received before the cost-cutting measures were set in motion."
"So there is still some way to go."
"And so, Mr President, I would very much like to thank you for having also played a part in the campaign for greater openness within the EU."
"Over the past five years, a consensus has been created within Parliament with a view to working towards greater openness."
"And Parliament has decided by a large majority that all documents must be public unless we decide by a two thirds majority to prohibit access to them."
"There is a consensus on this stance in Parliament, but unfortunately this is not yet the case within the Commission and the Council."
"Under the Amsterdam Treaty, we are now contending with Commission proposals which do not mean a greater degree of openness, but perhaps if anything less openness."
"Finally, I would like to thank Mr Santer and Mr Oreja, because after 20 years' work we have succeeded in getting the Commission's internal telephone directory officially issued, with a covering letter stating that within a few months everyone else will also be able to get hold of it, once the prototype has become a real telephone directory."
"And so, after 45 years with a secret telephone directory, it will in a few months also be possible for the general public to track down the person in the Commission who, for example, is responsible for issuing telephone directories."
"Thank you, Mr President, for your helpful collaboration."
"Mr President, you began with a personal account and then you went on to a collective overview."
"Please allow me to make a point of order. I hope you will indulge me because of my age and also because I am coming to the end of my term of office and will not return."
"In your collective overview which, in my view, was given in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, which you have always strictly abided by and respected, thereby setting us an example to follow, you should have included the fact that this Parliament is coming to the end of its term of office and that it was unable to prevent war taking place on European soil."
"In the debate that took place yesterday Parliament was unable to put a stop to the many war crimes and crimes against humanity that are taking place. Instead, the resolutions, the debate and the reports by the Council and the Commission turned the debate into a whitewash of these crimes!"
"This is not a good precedent for the next Parliament."
"European Council of 3/4 June in Cologne - Institutional reform"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the statements by the Council and the Commission on the preparation of the European Council meeting in Cologne on 3 and 4 June; -the oral questions to the Council (B4-0334/99) and the Commission (B4-0335/99) by Mr De Giovanni, on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, on the forthcoming institutional reform."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too want to begin by thanking you, Mr President, on behalf of the Council."
"It is, of course, a little difficult for the Council to thank the President of Parliament; for if it praises him too much, that is supposed to mean it has done something wrong, which is why I would like to say that you are the Council's partner, an uncomfortable partner, conciliating on real issues but quite unyielding when it comes to representing Parliament's rights."
"But we have cooperated well and successfully, for which I give you very warm thanks."
"Let me also say quite specifically on behalf of the Council that this Parliament took a qualitative leap forward during this term of office."
"That is thanks to you, Mr President, and to your predecessor, my friend and political companion Klaus Hänsch."
"After all, it is not just that Parliament has acquired more rights and is asserting them."
"More importantly, it has become much more firmly anchored in European public opinion than any previous European Parliament, and that is the crucial difference."
"This Parliament is seen as a genuine parliament, and from the Council's point of view I can only say that it is taken seriously as such, indeed more and more so."
"Mr President, I wish you all the best, both personally and politically."
"I now come to the matter in hand."
"The phase of European development ahead of us is determined by the fact that once again we have to set a number of important signals."
"In Berlin we wanted to secure the financial bases of the Union up to the year 2006 with Agenda 2000, with particular reference to the tasks relating to enlargement."
"Here I want to give particular thanks to Parliament for its constructive approach to this question over the past weeks."
"After Berlin sought to protect the Union's financial ability to act, the Cologne summit will now endeavour also to protect and strengthen its political ability to act in the long term."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force a few days ago, a historic breakthrough."
"The Treaty provides the European Union with a wider range of instruments but at the same time raises new questions to which we shall have to find answers in Cologne."
"However, our activities are overshadowed by an issue that dominates all others, the conflict in Kosovo and the accompanying human tragedies."
"That was debated here in depth yesterday afternoon, so I need not go into it again in detail."
"I just want to establish again that against the background of developments in the Balkans, over the past weeks the European Union has demonstrated its unity and resolve, from the joint declaration by the Heads of State and Government of 24 March to the General Affairs Council's decision last week to toughen the sanctions."
"The Council continues to maintain that on the threshold of the 21st century Europe cannot allow the numerically largest ethnic group in Kosovo to be collectively deprived of its rights and subjected to severe, systematic human rights violations."
"We must ensure that hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons can return to their homes."
"No ruler should be able to claim that persecution and murder are a matter of internal policy."
"That is the lesson of the 20th century."
"We must also repeat that for us this Kosovo conflict is not just a matter of humanitarian objectives and humanitarian questions."
"It is also a matter of the general European perspective of our policy of integration and of the long-term security and stability of Europe as a whole."
"If Milosevic achieves his aim of a Kosovo no longer inhabited by Albanians, that will create a source of crisis in a region that is in any case not very stable and could lead to numerous new conflicts."
"The aim of stabilising south-eastern Europe will become remote and there will be no prospect at all of integrating that part of Europe."
"Europe would remain incomplete."
"That is why it was so important to look beyond the military objective and set out a political plan for pacifying the entire region."
"The German Presidency of the Council took the initiative and made the necessary proposals."
"The Heads of State and Government supported the German proposals at their meeting on 14 April in Brussels."
"Last week the Council decided to begin preparing a stability pact for south-eastern Europe, an initiative that the entire international community now firmly welcomes."
"Together with the international organisations and the neighbouring states concerned, we will hold the first working meeting on 27 May and will hold the first conference of foreign ministers on 11 June."
"It is against this backdrop that the European Council will be meeting in Cologne on 3 and 4 June."
"While the Council will have to take a serious look at current developments in Kosovo, it must not ignore the other central issues relating to its political ability to act."
"Cologne will look at the following major issues: firstly, the European Employment Pact; secondly, the timetable for the forthcoming institutional reform; thirdly, the European charter of basic rights; fourthly, the common strategy towards Russia; and fifthly, the further development of the European security and defence policy."
"Let me say a few words on these points."
"Unemployment is the most urgent social problem of the present time."
"Thanks to the Employment Pact, which we hope to adopt in Cologne, we want to give the people of Europe a sign that the European Union is looking at their concerns."
"The pact is to become the expression of an active labour market policy that seeks more than before to avoid unemployment, in other words that looks above all at reducing youth and long-term unemployment and at ending the discrimination against women on the labour market."
"We want to interlink the national and European level measures to promote employment more closely and link them to a coordinated monetary, financial and wages policy as also to economic structural changes."
"A working paper submitted by the German Presidency was discussed for the first time and positively received at the informal ECOFIN Council in Dresden in mid-April."
"The idea of also involving the social partners and the European Central Bank in the future dialogue on fiscal, wages and monetary policy found strong support."
"Another important item on the Cologne agenda will be institutional reforms."
"In accordance with the request of the Vienna European Council, it will have to be decided in Cologne how and when to tackle the institutional questions not resolved by the Amsterdam Treaty and that have to be resolved prior to enlargement."
"The Presidency of the Council will shortly be submitting concrete proposals on the subject with a view to Cologne."
"At present we are still at the stage of intensive consultations with the Member States."
"Insofar as Treaty changes are required to resolve these questions, they will have to be agreed in the framework of a conference of Member State government representatives."
"Pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty, a formal hearing of the European Parliament will also be necessary before such a conference is convened."
"But initially Cologne will be concerned only with the further procedural steps, with laying down the procedures, the timetable and the agenda for the intergovernmental conference."
"The Amsterdam protocol on the institutions with a view to enlargement of the European Union, together with the declarations on the subject, provide the framework for the intergovernmental conference, but we might indeed have to go further."
"The developments early this year that led to the resignation of the Commission and to a discussion about reforms certainly give reason to examine the relations between the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission in this regard."
"I think it is most important to build on the democratic control that the House has exercised so effectively here."
"We must fully restore confidence in the institutions; we must not have a repeat of the institutional crisis we have just gone through."
"In the view of the presidency, it is essential to further strengthen the European Parliament."
"The more able the European Union becomes to act, the more its actions and decisions must have democratic legitimacy."
"That also means, for instance, that in all cases where the Council adopts legislative acts by majority vote - and we want to make majority decisions the rule - the European Parliament must have equal codecision powers on an equal footing."
"The careful preparation of the intergovernmental conference will be vital to its successful conclusion."
"Here we will be able to draw on the comprehensive preliminary work that was carried out during the intergovernmental conference on the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Given this time-frame, the intergovernmental conference could be convened as early as the beginning of next year and brought to a conclusion in the course of the year 2000."
"That is an ambitious aim, but I believe that a short and clearly circumscribed intergovernmental conference could send out an important signal about the European Union's ability to enlarge and about the effectiveness of its institutions."
"Irrespective of whether the institutional questions left over from Amsterdam are resolved, we will have to look in the medium or long term at the question of the constitution of Europe."
"The German Foreign Minister, Mr Fischler, pointed out here in Parliament that following Maastricht and Amsterdam the question of a European constitution is now more serious than it once was."
"We know that the Amsterdam Treaty only entered into force a few days ago and we must begin by gathering experience from it, because even now the comprehensive debate on the future development and form of the European Union is showing more and more clearly that in addition to the European Parliament the national parliaments and the broadest possible spectrum of social groups must also be involved."
"The German proposal to draw up a European charter of basic rights also belongs in this context."
"Our initial aim for Cologne is to be asked to draw up a charter of this kind."
"At the given moment we will have to consider whether and how this kind of European charter of basic rights can take precedence over the European treaties."
"We need to tell the people of Europe that their basic rights apply in the same way at European level as at national level."
"The first talks on this charter of basic rights have now begun and I am sure that we will manage to agree on the further procedure in Cologne."
"Formulating this kind of charter of basic rights would be a typical task for Members of Parliament - they are best able to do so and it is what they must do - and we will certainly take account of that aspect in our proposal concerning the practical form that charter of basic rights should assume."
"The Amsterdam Treaty has markedly enhanced the Union's ability to act in foreign policy."
"Even if the Union is already demonstrating great solidarity now - as in the Kosovo crisis -we still need to develop the common foreign and security policy further."
"If ever there was a need for a common European foreign and security policy, then it must be now, and it is time for all doubting Thomases to hold their tongue."
"We need it;"
"Europe can no longer accept the fact that it has become an economic world power and yet does not even have the political power to resolve its regional problems."
"One way of achieving this is through the CFSP High Representative to be appointed in Cologne, as provided by the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Another is the common strategy towards Russia that we want to adopt for the first time in Cologne and which we will be able to implement on the basis of majority decisions."
"This common strategy towards Russia is a pilot project; it will very much determine the face of future common strategies."
"Work has already begun on further common strategies, but they will not yet be ready for decision-taking by the time of Cologne."
"We also need a European security and defence policy if we are to implement a common foreign and security policy."
"Here it is clear that collective defence in Europe will remain the task of NATO; but the European Union must also develop its own military crisis-management capability for cases where the European Union or WEU believes there is a need for action but in which our North American partners do not wish to or cannot be involved."
"Tony Blair's initiative in Pörtschach and the Franco-British meeting in St Malo gave fresh impetus to this question."
"After the creation of the single market and economic and monetary union, the formulation of a European security and defence identity has now become central to the European integration process."
"Without it that process would remain incomplete."
"During our dual presidency of the EU and WEU, we are resolutely endeavouring to make use of this new dynamic."
"We intend to draw up a report on means of further developing the European security and defence identity by the time of the Cologne European Council."
"That report will form the basis of a new European Council decision in Cologne that concretely defines the further procedure in this important policy area."
"Among others it will cover the question of possibly integrating the WEU in the EU, pursuant to Article 17 of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"As you can see, even without the additional challenges facing the Union as a result of the crisis in Kosovo and the resignation of the Commission, there is a wide range of tasks to be dealt with in Cologne."
"As you know, however, situations of crisis can also release forces and produce their own dynamism; the German Presidency remains confident that it can match up to its responsibility to develop the European Union into a pan-European and at the same time global community that has the ability to act."
"It hopes that here it can continue to count on the support of the European Parliament."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Cologne European Council comes at a decisive moment for the European Union."
"The entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May marks a further step forward."
"A newly elected Parliament will take up office in a few weeks' time. There is also to be a new Commission."
"Later this morning you will be voting on the appointment of the future President, Romano Prodi."
"The new President will need the support of the European Parliament to make a success of his term of office."
"All these factors need to be capitalised on to give European integration a fresh boost."
"Lessons need to be drawn from the past with a view to preparing for the future."
"Now is the time to prepare the ground for the institutional changes ahead."
"Before discussing this and replying to Mr De Giovanni, I would first like to briefly run through the other issues due to come up for discussion at the Cologne European Council in a month's time."
"The situation in Kosovo will of course be discussed."
"The European Union will obviously be called upon to play a major role here. First, there will be the reconstruction phase where the Commission will have a coordinating role alongside the World Bank, for which it will need adequate support and resources."
"The Union will then have to devote itself to defining a genuine strategy for stability in the Balkans, and Cologne will be an important step along the way."
"Cologne is also where the first common strategy under the Amsterdam Treaty is due to be adopted. As you are aware, this common strategy concerns Russia."
"This is no easy task, if only because the Council and the Commission do not, in the end, have all that much time available, but we are making good progress."
"This is all the more significant in the context of the Kosovo crisis."
"It is more important than ever to maintain and develop constructive and close political, economic and commercial dialogue with Russia."
"The Kosovo crisis is also a stark reminder of the need for a proper European defence identity."
"Following the progress made at the Atlantic Alliance summit in Washington, the European Union will need to adopt a solid stance."
"As regards the economy, the prospects for growth in 1999 are not looking quite so good. But there are some positive signs."
"Consumer confidence, which has remained high, is gradually taking a hold on businesses, whilst the drop in the European Central Bank's key interest rates is also grounds for optimism."
"It is nonetheless clear that alongside the requisite budget consolidation, Europe will also need to speed up the structural reforms of the employment, goods, services and capital markets. It was with this in mind that the Commission recently adopted its recommendation on the broad economic policy guidelines."
"This comprises specific country-by-country recommendations, including economic reform issues. I hope these recommendations will be discussed openly and thoroughly this year."
"The coordination of economic policies should not just be left on the drawing board."
"The Commission will also be reporting on the development of the trans-European networks and hopes that the European Investment Bank will make its contribution, as it did at the Amsterdam European Council in 1997."
"Moreover, the European Council will discuss a report by the Ministers of Finance on the structure of international finance."
"The crises in Asia and Russia highlighted the need for reforms in this area."
"Progress was made during the discussions at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington just over a week ago. However, I would have liked to have seen Europe genuinely speaking with a single voice."
"Let us consider, for example, debt relief for the poorest nations: why should each of the European G7 countries have to come up with its own relief plan?"
"Why should we leave it to our partners, in particular the Americans, to organise the Community's external representation for the euro, rather than acting on the decision taken at the Vienna European Council?"
"Cologne is set to be interesting from the employment point of view."
"The Luxembourg process has taken root and is starting to produce results in terms of national employment policies that are more systematic, integrated and far-reaching. At the instigation of the German Presidency, we will be taking a further step towards the European Employment Pact which I called for back in January 1996."
"To help the discussions, the Commission will be sending the European Council a communication on the best way of integrating the objective of higher employment into the formulation and implementation of Community policies and measures."
"Cologne will also see the forthcoming institutional reform begin to take shape."
"It is not, of course, for me to speculate what submissions Romano Prodi and the new Commission will want to make to prepare the ground for institutional reform, or what they will wish the reform to involve."
"I would, however, remind you that even when it was putting Agenda 2000 together, the Commission called for the questions first raised at Amsterdam to be settled and said that a more far-reaching reform should follow."
"Any delay in strengthening the institutions and the way they operate can only jeopardise the actual enlargement of the Union."
"The new reform must prepare the institutions for enlargement. But it must also supply solutions to certain problems in the working of the institutions which have come to light in the last few months."
"So the institutions need overhauling, that much is certain. But the overhaul must focus on the priorities, rather than just drawing up shopping lists, knowing, as we do, that we must not project the alarming image of Europe as a building site which is never completed."
"There is no doubt that the job needs to be done in stages; but we certainly cannot have a state of never-ending construction work."
"I would add that there is no point in dreaming up new reforms if the political will to implement what already exists is lacking. We must build on what we have already achieved."
"I am thinking, for instance, of the justice and home affairs section of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"And I would call on the public and the institutions to take a close look at how intentions are converted into procedures and working methods."
"Looking beyond the institutional reforms which must be put in place, I would like to plead for a consistent approach."
"We cannot call for new European programmes, condemn the use of technical assistance offices and refuse to provide more human resources all at the same time."
"We cannot make high-sounding declarations about the principle of subsidiarity on the one hand, and constantly demand fresh initiatives from the Commission on the other."
"We cannot expect the Commission to act as a strong political driving force and at the same time give the impression of wanting to turn it into a mere secretariat for the Council or the European Parliament."
"Applause from certain quarters"
"Some issues have already been identified: weighting the votes in the Council and reducing the number of Members of the Commission."
"But we will have to go further than that if we are to carry out a thorough reform of the Treaty provisions that govern the composition of the institutions and the way they work."
"Whatever happens, such a reform must include bringing in qualified majority voting as standard practice, as the President-in-Office just mentioned."
"Thought also needs to be given to extending the codecision procedure."
"Should we go further?"
"Certainly."
"For example, the thorny matter of collective responsibility and the individual accountability of Commissioners needs to be addressed."
"The principle that policy decisions are taken collectively is, it seems to me, as vital now as it ever was, for the very legitimacy of the Commission and the European institutional system. But that should not lead to a failure of individual accountability in certain situations where decisions are not and cannot be taken collectively."
"This contradiction - which is only apparent - will be resolved by the judicious exercise of the new powers enjoyed by the President of the Commission."
"The Cologne European Council will therefore have to take stands on some major issues."
"Be it employment, Kosovo, enlargement or the working of the institutions, the European Union must learn to speak with one voice: one voice for the 15 Member States and one voice for the institutions, too."
"This does not mean that they must always follow the same line. It means that they must work together, that a constructive approach must be taken to enhancing and strengthening the Europe of the future in the eyes of our fellow citizens and to giving it the place it deserves in the international arena."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first, as chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, starting my last public speech, I too would like to thank the President of our Parliament very much for the work we have been able to do together. I sincerely want to pay tribute to him for that, and now I will go straight on to the issue of institutional reform."
"Institutional reform is on the table again and that is greatly to the credit of the German Presidency, I have to say, right from the President-in-Office's speech to Parliament in January."
"Two fundamental issues have been raised: the need to hold an intergovernmental conference very early in the year 2000, with a method and timetable to be discussed, and the issue of the constitution, which Mr Verheugen has taken up, as I was delighted to discover this morning."
"Why do I consider it important, indeed essential, for institutional negotiations to reopen?"
"Because there is a need for more Europe, there is a need for Europe to have a role in the world."
"The historical and political context demonstrates that, and without reformed institutions and a strong political will the need for Europe cannot actually be met."
"And then, as the President-in-Office said this morning, the institutional balances are out of kilter and need to be redefined. The Council did well to appoint Romano Prodi as President so quickly, but we all know - and now President Santer has said so - there is still the problem of defining a stronger political role for the Commission."
"In short, there are institutional balances to be restored."
"The agenda for the intergovernmental conference must certainly cover 'the Amsterdam triangle' as it is called in Community jargon."
"It must certainly include qualified majority voting, which is not in fact a technical issue, as we all know, but a highly political issue calling into question the sovereignty of the nation states."
"And the agenda must certainly touch on the composition of the Commission and the way the votes are weighted."
"We know all that."
"But we need something else as well, because, as people have highlighted, the background to the intergovernmental conference in 2000 will be complex and difficult, so foreign policy and, above all, the area of freedom, security and justice are issues which must be raised again."
"In our resolution we raise the problem of the method."
"We do not introduce fundamental points like Article N, naturally, but we say that changes need to be made at the preparatory stage, because the intergovernmental method has proved inadequate, which is why we need to prepare differently if the intergovernmental conference is to be a success."
"We are pressing, as we did before in the November 1997 Méndez de Vigo and Tsatsos resolution, for a Commission document to underpin interinstitutional coordination involving civil society and national and regional parliaments."
"To put it as briefly as I can, what we need is a highly authoritative document on the intergovernmental conference table, because preparing for the intergovernmental conference in a different way may guarantee safer results in terms of reform."
"That is the point!"
"We do not include Article N in the discussion, we do not discuss the need for final unanimity, but we do say we must prepare for this conference in a different way."
"Why?"
"Because Europe demands it, because Europe needs strong institutions!"
"Let me make one final reference to the issue of the constitution."
"I am, I repeat, delighted that the President-in-Office returned to this subject this morning."
"We know the problem today is not to write a constitution, as we have done in the past and as we have demonstrated that we are capable of doing."
"We know there are two problems today."
"First, there is the need to simplify the principles in the Treaty to present clear rules, principles and values to the public, so that they know what we mean when we talk about Europe and Europe's constitution."
"Secondly, there is the area of freedom, security and justice, where flesh and blood people live and move. Those people need legal and jurisdictional guarantees."
"That is why we talk about including fundamental rights in the Treaty - Mr Verheugen reminded us of that again this morning - and I believe we can build a political Europe and a people's Europe at the same time on that basis because the two either move forward together or do not move forward at all."
"Thank you, Mr De Giovanni."
"Given that this is your last speech, I would like to thank you, on behalf of Parliament, for all the work you have done and for your dedication and determination."
"Mr President, I would like thank you for letting me speak and ask if these statements by the Council and the Commission are to be followed by motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37 of our Rules of Procedure."
"Yes indeed, and they will be put to the vote tomorrow."
"So they shall be put to the vote tomorrow."
"This means that a special decision was taken as an exception to Rule 37(4), which states that they should normally be put to the vote on the same day."
"I just wanted to verify that point."
"Yes, that has been decided."
"Mr President, before I begin, I would like to add my voice to the statements already made by some of my colleagues, on behalf of the political groups, congratulating you on your work."
"In this case, because of the personal relationship I have had with the President for a long time, I would also like to congratulate him on having carried out his work so successfully."
"I also wanted to take this opportunity to say goodbye to Mr Santer as President of the Commission, as I believe that this is the last debate he is going to attend."
"I would congratulate him, too, on his work while in office."
"The German Presidency has done a great deal of work since it took over."
"Contrary to expectations it managed to conclude the Agenda 2000 package, which seemed extremely difficult, and now it has just informed us about the fairly ambitious programme for the Cologne European Council, on which I must congratulate it."
"In his speech, the President of the Commission set out five very clear points that represent genuine requirements of the Union."
"The first requirement is the European Employment Pact."
"The German Presidency is right to give priority to this proposal as, in spite of other issues, there is no doubt that the main everyday problem for Europeans is employment."
"The only question mark is whether or not the European Union will have sufficient resources in the years ahead to implement an employment policy of its own given that the financial perspective for the 2000-2006 period has been reduced and practically all Community policies have had to face cutbacks."
"We are naturally very pleased with the specific reference to an intergovernmental conference in the year 2000, which my colleague Mr De Giovanni has already mentioned."
"The question of institutional reform was clearly left unresolved at Amsterdam. If it is not resolved, enlargement will be impossible."
"Allowing all the countries applying for membership of the Union to join under the present conditions would require significant changes to the structure of the EU."
"This intergovernmental conference will face a difficult task, but I would still like to thank the German Presidency for having addressed the issue so clearly."
"Of course, the European Union's Achilles' heel is still the common foreign and security policy, and the German Presidency has stressed the need to develop Article 17 of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The first step towards creating a European defence identity - which is proving essential - is to incorporate the Western European Union into the EU system."
"Another important element is the appointment of a prominent figure to be responsible for implementing this policy, in other words the CFSP High Representative."
"We must point out that, from Parliament's point of view, it would have been better to leave this in the hands of the Commission, rather than trying to turn the Commission into a form of secretariat for the Council, as President Santer mentioned."
"Finally, I would like to end by congratulating the German Presidency - and Mr Verheugen in particular - on the excellent work that has been done since the beginning of the year."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, we have been given an introduction here to the difficult questions facing the Cologne summit, which have to be resolved in our common interest. I am particularly grateful for the fact that so much emphasis has been put on the concept of the common foreign, security and defence policy, for Kosovo shows us how necessary it is that we achieve results in terms both of prevention and of the EU's ability to act."
"If the German Presidency intends to make appropriate use of its dual presidency of the European Union and of the WEU, that is to be welcomed. But it is also important to use the potential offered by the Treaty of Amsterdam in regard to implementing the common foreign and security policy for the genuine good of the Community and not to continue following the old methods."
"Belatedly, although not too late, Russia is also being brought into the process again."
"A common Russia strategy, which would establish a balance on this continent and help bring about solutions, is welcome."
"But here we must not forget that in view of the many disputes we are currently facing in, for example, the field of trade, we should also improve relations with the United States. Mr Verheugen, I would therefore cordially request you to ensure that the US-EU summit in Bonn on 19 June is also used to strengthen the partnership and cooperation between the USA and Europe, to improve its shape and also to involve the parliaments in the appropriate way."
"Given the problems of unemployment, the Employment Pact is a most important subject."
"However, we will be looking very carefully at the outcome of the summit and examine the distribution of tasks in terms of the role of the national states in employment policy and the European role, so as to avoid giving the mistaken impression that Europe is responsible in the wrong area."
"We will also make sure we do not have a repeat at European level of the Lafontaine policy mix between monetary, financial and wage policy."
"I do not know what you meant by saying the European Central Bank should be involved here like the social partners and I hope I misunderstood you."
"The European Central Bank must play an entirely independent role and cannot be a component of a strategy put together by the governments."
"Let me make a final remark."
"Mr Méndez de Vigo will have more to say about this."
"The institutional reform must be achieved in cooperation with the European Parliament, which must certainly have a better role to play at the intergovernmental conference than it did in Amsterdam, where it remained rather on the sidelines."
"I hope the German Presidency of the Council will manage to ensure that."
"We must make the European Union capable of enlargement by extending majority decision-making."
"If in a second stage constitutional and other such questions are discussed, then it must be made clear that this will not delay the enlargement timetable."
"But we should keep these questions on the agenda and I can only congratulate you on the idea that we should formulate a strategy for drawing up a charter of basic rights."
"If that could be achieved in cooperation with the European Parliament and the national parliaments, it would do a great deal for the people and for the identity of the European Union."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, during the 1998 congress in The Hague, the European Movement expressed its regret that the Union now seems condemned to progress in a vast conceptual vacuum and appears to lack any political perspective at a time when it is setting off on the two greatest adventures of its history: the launch of the single currency and enlargement."
"Since 1998, another major challenge has appeared: the war in Kosovo."
"We must oppose all attacks on people's rights at the borders of Europe."
"But I must remind you that it is not the European idea that is at issue here."
"In his speech yesterday morning, Mr Prodi explained to us the fundamental values on which that is based."
"What is at issue, and what should be looked at seriously by the Cologne Council, is the fact that the political leaders of certain Member States have, for far too long now, tended to hang on to the outdated remains of their national sovereignty, particularly in terms of foreign policy."
"The tragedy in Kosovo, which has been on the cards for almost ten years, is a terrible illustration of this."
"As a result, the European Parliament's compromise text stresses the importance of appointing the High Representative for the CFSP in Cologne. It also stresses that this High Representative must be supported by the policy planning and early warning unit and must also have the ability, through his or her personality, to play an important role."
"The Liberal Group is particularly pleased that emphasis has been placed on the urgent need to strengthen institutional relations with the Western European Union, which should eventually have its own defence and prevention force."
"I would now like to congratulate the chairman, Mr De Giovanni, on the text of his resolution, which, I am convinced, will serve as a reference point for the next Parliament. I must say that it was a great privilege to work with him."
"To my mind, there are two key issues that should be considered in Cologne."
"The first of these is the timetable."
"The timetable approved by the Committee on Institutional Affairs puts emphasis on the conclusion of the work of the next IGC before the first enlargement."
"Only a requirement such as this will allow the applicant countries to embark on a political project, in full knowledge of the facts, where the acquis communautaire cannot be called into question."
"The second issue is the method."
"The method used to prepare the ground for the Treaty of Amsterdam proved to have various weaknesses."
"We will therefore have to change our method. In other words, we will have to give the Commission the role it deserves, that of the driving force behind the next reform."
"Mr Prodi's ambition in relation to the political authority he plans to exercise, along with his colleagues and the European Parliament, augurs well for the future; he is a committed European and we wish him every success. We would also like to thank Mr Santer for the work he has done during his time in office."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I have very carefully read and listened to the motion for a resolution tabled by Mr De Giovanni. I must take this opportunity to congratulate and thank him for his impartiality, conscientiousness and fairmindedness both in general and also as chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, in which I have participated in recent years."
"I wish to highlight a few of the most important aspects of this motion and the corresponding discussions. These relate to the idea which has prevailed and which still prevails of a European constitution, the establishment of or the desire to establish a specific constituent authority at Community level and a certain and perhaps corrective interpretation of the former Article N of the Treaty."
"I have read, listened and reflected."
"I always taught my pupils that the law and politics must respond to the concerns of the people."
"At this point in time, it is apparent to me that the people of the European Union are concerned about war, misery, social exclusion, unemployment, drug trafficking and crime in general."
"As far as I have heard, they are not calling for a European constitution, unless they believe that a European constitution will solve everyone's problems."
"However, I do not share this belief."
"For me, a European constitution enshrining rights and duties which are not in themselves feasible and cannot be complied with is of little help with the problems currently on the minds of the people of Europe."
"I also have my doubts about the European specific constituent authority."
"I too believe that the constituent authority comes from the people but I also believe and would argue at the moment that we do not have a European people. This does not mean, however, that this will not develop in the future and perhaps this should develop."
"Our borders are therefore not currently defined."
"So I consider, or I at least share the belief, that institutional reforms must be implemented. However, these must not assume the form of a constant building site."
"In particular, they must take account of the people, respond to their concerns and always include them."
"To conclude, if the people are not included, the building may collapse at any moment."
"And what I do not want to see, because I am a firm believer in Europe, is Europe collapsing due to any of these pitfalls."
"Madam President, in the light of the structural unemployment in Europe, it is easy to understand the importance of the Cologne European Council."
"To govern is to make choices, and there are various choices available."
"My group feels that, given the choices set out in, for instance, the manifesto of the British and Spanish Prime Ministers, Tony Blair and José María Aznar, advocating further deregulation and greater flexibility, we would opt instead for a Franco-Italian proposal, based on relaunching active employment policies and public investment."
"The Cologne European Council must be more than just a combination of good intentions, a catalogue of unconnected actions or the sum of the national employment policies."
"The public would not accept this, nor would it be credible."
"As far as the institutional timetable is concerned, we fully agree that institutional reform is now vital and that we must define the stages leading up to an intergovernmental conference. We can also tell the Council that Parliament has worked for many years to establish a genuine inventory of fundamental rights."
"We are in the best position to help."
"As regards the war in Yugoslavia, in the Balkans, and particularly in Kosovo, we must state loudly and clearly that we totally condemn the activities of the Milosevic regime in Kosovo and that it is time to consider a political solution."
"In Yugoslavia or in Serbia, there are a million innocent people, a million good people who can help us stop the bombing, the widespread destruction of infrastructure and the collateral damage, and help us find a political solution in the wake of the punishment meted out not only to the Milosevic regime, but also to the population in general."
"The German Presidency should be particularly sensitive to this."
"I would never blame the German people for the sins of the regime it had to suffer under Hitler's dictatorship, and I feel that the same should apply in Yugoslavia."
"In this way, I hope that we can overcome the problems we face and come to an agreement on achieving peace for Europe."
"Madam President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, as we have learned here in Parliament, in the alternation of presidencies what is important is not so much which country is in office or the abilities of its leading representatives as the underlying dynamic of the state of the Union."
"And I really must say at this solemn moment that there is great cause for concern here."
"Every person of sense now knows that the neo-liberal counter-reform has failed."
"And yet we go on here as though nothing had happened and at best we keep setting up new corporative consultation mechanisms."
"That is a good thing, but it is not the change of course that we need and without that change of course we will not satisfy the expectations of the peoples of Europe, who after all have been voting out the representatives of the neo-liberal counter-reform since 1995/96."
"Why do we not have the courage, the strength and the imagination to bring about this change of course?"
"In this context, as a member of the Greens I particularly regret the resignation of my old friend Oskar Lafontaine."
"Instead of seeing a clear change of course in European policy in year one of the euro and a move towards a new type of economic development that can also resolve the problem of mass unemployment, we are given a European employment pact that falls far short of what the Santer initiative once contained, that falls far short of what the original proposals that came from the presidency's German Ministry of Finance contained."
"It is not a question of whether the bottle is half full or half empty; it is a question of whether there will be a bottle at all or whether all that is fashioned in Cologne is a paper bottle that cannot be filled with anything."
"This is a fight we will now have to engage in, to ensure that we have a bottle that we can then fill."
"So I ask colleagues for their solidarity and openly welcome the European marches against mass unemployment which will bring these demands into the open again in Cologne; I hope that will help jolt the summit into action."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Cologne summit has some very important work to do and also has the important task of appointing the High Representative for the CFSP."
"From that perspective, it is unfortunate - and I am continuing to stress this point - that it is still being held on the dates it was originally planned for."
"If we had not had the crisis that shook the Commission, we would have found ourselves in a situation where, in spite of Parliament's requests, the European Council would have taken all the decisions without giving any consideration to the views of the voters who will be going to the polls between 10 and 13 June."
"I have two requests to put to the Council."
"In relation to our foreign policy and our policy towards the United Nations, the European Union must make progress and speak out on two key issues: the ratification of the Statute of the permanent Criminal Court and the moratorium on capital executions, which was requested through a vote by the United Nations Commission in Geneva."
"If the Union and the presidency were to highlight these two issues in the European Council to indicate the path to be followed and the choice to be made by the Union in the months ahead, we would be making a firm commitment in two areas which, in my view, will be critical as the third millennium approaches."
"As far as institutional reform is concerned, I must thank Biagio De Giovanni, the chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, for his proposals. These are to be taken into account during the next parliamentary term and by the current and future presidency."
"The Group of the European Radical Alliance added an amendment which I hope will be voted through so as to add an official and formal note to the European Parliament's right to ratify any proposal for reform."
"I hope that this amendment will be accepted during the vote, which is to be held shortly."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, the European Union is currently facing an institutional crisis following the collective resignation of the Commission. Yet the lesson the Council seems to want to draw from all this is that we should actually move towards more federalism, more of a superstate and more power for the Commission."
"The Heads of State and Government have already sought to appoint a more political President of the Commission, who will be responsible for exploiting all the federalist opportunities provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The President-designate, Mr Romano Prodi, seems to have decided, in fact, to make this a very political role."
"In his speech yesterday, he spoke of his political responsibility, of the Commissioners' ability to provide political direction, of his role of political guidance and of the need for him to take an important political initiative."
"In short, the nominated President of the Commission is already tending to take the position of a head of state, with an extra dose of ultra-liberal and free trade attitudes that should worry even the traditional Liberals."
"The European Parliament will naturally encourage this development of government, initially through the resolution it is undoubtedly about to adopt, which hopes to make the Commission the driving force behind institutional reforms."
"However, before taking any decisions, it would be wiser to wait for the second report by the Committee of Experts, which will no doubt give us an interesting insight into the workings of the institutions. The European Parliament has cautiously postponed the publication of this report until after the European elections."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations feels that the real lesson to be learned from all this is that we should restore the primacy of national democracies with a view to bringing Europe closer to the people."
"In this respect, the draft Statute for Members of the European Parliament - which the Council has just approved - sends out a signal in the wrong direction."
"In our view, it is totally unacceptable for the Members of this House to be paid out of the Community budget rather than by their own countries. An elected representative must be paid by those he represents and no one else."
"Otherwise, we would be institutionalising a dangerous mechanism against the people; it would represent - if I may say so, Madam President - an insidious coup d'état ."
"Madam President, the Treaty of Amsterdam, which can be dubbed the treaty of lost opportunity, only came into force a few days ago and already it needs to have chapters on the institutional issues not resolved in Amsterdam incorporated into it to complete it."
"The European Council in Cologne must remedy these omissions and do the groundwork for the reform of the Commission, the extension of qualified majority voting and the reweighting of the votes within the Council."
"We are against any solution which reduces the powers of the Commission."
"It must retain its independence and its power to make proposals."
"These are both indispensable conditions for the fulfilment of its autonomous functions, in the general interest of the European Union."
"The exercise of these prerogatives prevents the Commission from becoming a sort of Council secretariat and hence dwindling to a level inappropriate to the political role it ought to play."
"It would also be improper and inappropriate for that role to dwindle into a bureaucratic one, without taking account of the need to extend the principle of subsidiarity whenever the opportunity arises."
"But even if all these concerns were addressed in preparation for the summit of Heads of State and Government, that would not represent an adequate response to the gravity of the Kosovo crisis and would not make up for the notable absence of Europe from that particular trouble spot in the current affairs of the continent."
"If it wants to be equal to the role it ought to be playing, Europe has got to make up its mind finally to endow itself with a means of determining its own common foreign and security policy. A signal along those lines must go out from Cologne."
"A decision must be taken to make a start on political union. Our determination to take that route must be made clear, and it must be made clear that the European Union is going to be an active player in international relations and in dealing with crises, because it intends to equip itself with all the instruments it needs to guarantee its sovereignty and autonomy."
"We need a new Treaty now and, more importantly, we need to give the starting signal and define the exact ground to be covered, and these signals must come from Cologne, especially as, with the unfortunate experience of Kosovo, public opinion is proving more sensitive than before to the role Europe can play."
"Another unresolved issue, which affects the Union's ability to take action, is the lack of a common economic policy."
"The single market is prey to tensions and repercussions."
"A strong employment policy linked to development requires a coherent economic policy."
"There must be a definite signal marking the start of an irreversible stage which will lead to the solution the Union needs to operate effectively."
"The real economy of our countries needs new impetus to expand."
"That impetus will not come from stock exchange indicators. At worst, they disproportionately swell the financial bubble which dominates real economies like an incubus."
"Here too Cologne must give the signal in order to define an economic policy which finally sets out the objectives to be achieved, such as a different relationship with the global market organisation, the relaunch of quality as the hallmark of the European product, and lower taxes on businesses."
"We must ensure that Amsterdam is remembered as an opportunity regained rather than lost."
"Madam President, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council about Cologne is, as always with presidencies of the Council - and especially the German Presidency - very ambitious."
"But it is not enough just to wish the presidency of the Council and the Council as a whole good luck in achieving the objectives of the Cologne summit."
"Parliament should also make it clear that we have our own ideas on the central subjects of that summit and that we want the intended measures to produce a successful outcome."
"So I want to concentrate on two points."
"The first is the institutional reforms and the preparations for the intergovernmental conference."
"It will not surprise you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if I do not take the same line as my colleague Mr Elmar Brok."
"If the institutions are to cooperate successfully but also if we are to secure what is eventually achieved in the intergovernmental conference for the long term and implement it successfully, then the European Parliament must be involved more closely in this conference than it was in past conferences - and I am deliberately not using the term intergovernmental conference, however much that has become common parlance - in this conference of the Member States."
"I know the will is there."
"And it is not just a matter of form either, nor of our wish for recognition."
"It is simply a question of normal procedures among democratic institutions of which more account should be taken in future."
"When you discuss the institutional reforms do remember that it is not just a question of figures but also of ensuring that the matter of Parliament's lack of power in relation to cooperation with the Council and the Commission - here I am addressing the inadequate codecision procedures - really is included in the agenda of this conference."
"In addressing this, I am also addressing in very concrete terms an area which greatly concerns this Parliament, the Council and the Commission and which continues to account for nearly half the entire EU budget."
"I am referring specifically to the common agricultural policy."
"We cannot accept that Parliament has no codecision right in this sector that accounts for half the budget."
"We really must fill this democratic gap."
"That is a most important point!"
"My second point concerns the common foreign and security policy."
"We urgently need it."
"It is clear to see and everybody will understand that Parliament is not very happy with the creation of a Mr or Mrs CFSP because this does not really fit into the kind of structures we have all built up in our Member States."
"But I do not want to quarrel about that now."
"I would like to see progress made in the common foreign and security policy."
"And that is also the view of my group."
"So we say: 'OK, do it, and do it quickly!'"
"Applause"
"Mr President-in-Office, in the speech by President Santer - which was an excellent speech and I would like to congratulate him on it - and the speeches by my other colleagues in the House, you will find a rare unanimity."
"Parliament is in favour of institutional reform and supports the presidency in its efforts to that end."
"We need it for the simple reason that it was not tackled in Amsterdam."
"We also need it because Parliament is in favour of enlargement and we do not want enlargement to be delayed any further because the institutions have not been reformed."
"We are therefore going to support all the initiatives the German Presidency takes to implement this reform as soon as possible."
"My colleague Mr Brok has already spoken about the content and I would like to speak about the method."
"I believe that, through the resolution last November which Mr De Giovanni mentioned, Parliament proposed something that is as original as it is simple: the idea of using the Community method, the method we are accustomed to, in order to prepare the reform of the institutions."
"We certainly do not wish to take the place of the governments, who will have to take the decisions."
"What we want to do is to help make things easier for them. So, with the approval in due course of President Santer - for which I would like to pay tribute to him - we believe that one good possibility would be for the European Commission to prepare a draft, to discuss it with Parliament and to also include the national parliaments in the discussion - for a discussion is all it would be."
"Eventually, we would be able to present the governments with a proposal, which we hope would receive as much support as possible."
"In my view, if the Commission is in agreement, if the European Parliament is in agreement and if the national parliaments have been involved, this document would have tremendous legitimacy, and the governments and any President-in-Office would be able to accept a discussion paper."
"I would point out once again that you would have the last word."
"I think that this is a good possibility, Mr President-in-Office, and I would ask you to give it your consideration in Cologne."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, you told us, Mr Santer, that Cologne would be interesting from an employment point of view and that we would be another step closer to the European Employment Pact."
"This is what we hope to see."
"When it was announced, our group welcomed the new approach set out in Luxembourg and in Pörtschach."
"These summits were actually marked by a change of tone and confirmed that our priority was the fight against unemployment."
"However, our hopes were not to be fulfilled with the subsequent Vienna summit."
"We had to content ourselves with statements; no specific measures were adopted."
"We hope that the Cologne summit will come up to the expectations of the people of Europe and will result in specific actions."
"In light of the preparatory work, we are hopeful, since certain governments are proposing active employment policies and measures to relaunch investment."
"However, the statements by Mr Prodi and other governments, which advocate competition, liberalisation, and the flexibility of work, are also casting a shadow over this hope."
"As the Secretary-General of the ESC recently pointed out, we must do away with a certain dogmatism and use stability to foster growth and employment."
"Our group is putting forward innovative proposals to support this growth and generate employment."
"We propose to replace the stability pact with a genuine growth pact. Its main priorities would be to relaunch profitable investment, to continue lowering interest rates selectively to promote employment, to work to reduce working hours without cutting wages, to put a stop to the process of liberalisation and deregulation, and to establish a minimum wage in every Member State."
"The German Presidency has rightly emphasised fiscal policy and its interaction with our economic and budget policies."
"In this area too, we must be innovative by combating fiscal dumping and taxing financial transactions."
"The social movement is becoming increasingly important at European level, and together with this movement we will work to ensure that these proposals contribute to a social and democratic Europe."
"Mr President, NATO's war against Yugoslavia has failed in its declared objective."
"It has not managed to put an end to the crimes against the people of Kosovo but instead has dramatically worsened their plight."
"But this failed NATO objective, the humanitarian crisis, was the only justification for violating international law and conducting this war of aggression."
"No end justifies the means."
"That realisation is one of the foundations of our civilisation."
"The ultima ratio has proved irrational."
"All those who do not now restore the rule of law and end this war bear responsibility for the terrible violence, for the civilian victims, for the destruction of the basic means of livelihood and civilian infrastructure in Serbia, for the use of forbidden weapons."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I want to address two points: employment policy and the announced intergovernmental conference."
"Let me first take this opportunity to thank both the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission for constantly bringing up and resolutely following up the question of employment policy, even though the Santer plan was not followed up to the same extent and came to nought in the Council."
"So I welcome the proposal once again to conclude a European employment pact in Cologne, especially after the preliminary discussions during the Austrian Presidency."
"For I think it would be very dangerous if the grave crises of today - such as Kosovo - led us to forget that we have a social crisis within the European Union."
"The President-in-Office of the Council rightly said that unemployment is the most urgent social problem of our time."
"I was painfully aware that the candidate for the presidency of the EU Commission failed to address this problem in equally clear and unambiguous terms yesterday."
"Let me also emphasise strongly that we need closer cooperation between the European countries and between monetary, financial and wage policy."
"It is an illusion to think - and I do not think anyone would pretend it was possible - that national or regional employment policy could be replaced by an EU-wide policy."
"What approach the European Central Bank takes, what kind of interest-rate and monetary policy it formulates, what kind of infrastructure is built up, whether it would not finally be possible to strengthen the European infrastructure in particular, all these things have a major impact on competitiveness, on unemployment and on the employment situation in Europe."
"In my view we must not desist here but must make greater efforts to coordinate these policies."
"Let me make a brief comment on the second point, the intergovernmental conference."
"I want to say quite openly and plainly that I am sceptical about the notion that the European Union can be reformed simply by holding a kind of intergovernmental conference."
"What the President-in-Office of the Council said here today in fact backs up this scepticism, for he said that far more comprehensive reforms will have to be undertaken."
"But can the representatives of governments whose powers, means of action and influence are being taken away and transferred to the European level put together a genuine reform package by themselves?"
"After all Amsterdam did not just fail because of the ill will of individuals, it also failed for structural reasons, because of the way these matters are approached."
"I believe we need a parliamentary constituent assembly in which this Parliament and the national parliaments cooperate at least as equal partners, as a complement to the intergovernmental conference, otherwise we will end up with another failed intergovernmental conference."
"I think it is essential also to involve this Parliament more closely in this process."
"Mr President, holding a European summit so soon before the European elections brings both dangers and opportunities."
"The biggest danger is that once again not one important decision will be taken and the people of Europe will turn away in despair from the spectacle of European cooperation within Europe, which is all too frequently hesitant and deficient."
"The biggest opportunity is that a number of issues will be resolved and confidence in European cooperation restored and strengthened."
"A breakthrough would be both useful and necessary on three points."
"The common defence and foreign policy has always been a non-starter, partly because a number of Member States have sought to retain primacy."
"The drama in Kosovo and the moral and military response to it have brought the Union together for the first time in this field."
"It would bring us nothing but credit if we could sustain this unity and defend this European cooperation on the basis of values such as democracy and human and minority rights."
"I would strongly urge the Council to do this."
"It is also just as urgent to get rid of the destructive unanimity requirement in the Council."
"A second step forward should be to establish better standards and values for a social Europe."
"We want a Europe which not only embraces economic and monetary cooperation but which is also concerned about unemployment, combating poverty and caring for the disabled and the elderly. In short, a Europe that seeks not only to earn money but also to be of service to a society in which humane standards carry weight."
"A third breakthrough is necessary in the field of the internal democracy and transparency of the European institutions."
"After the European summit in Cologne we must choose once and for all to have a Europe in which the European Parliament exercises control over all legislation and the entire budget and in which the European Commission is required to guarantee maximum transparency and management which is free from fraud."
"The loopholes in the Treaty of Amsterdam in this field must be closed as soon as possible."
"That is the kind of Europe we want, Mr President, a safe, social and democratic Europe which is free from fraud."
"If the Cologne summit can provide an impetus for this then as far as I am concerned it will have been a success."
"Mr President, Mr President-designate of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, employment issues have been accorded the importance they deserve in European Union policy, and at the Cologne summit Germany will be making efforts to push through the European employment agreement."
"In this regard the Amsterdam Treaty articles concerning employment can be said to be gaining substance."
"In pushing through the European strategy on employment it is vital to get to grips with measures that can provide added value for national efforts."
"It is especially important to ensure that Europe is competitive while still complying with agreements that have been made."
"The superiority of European labour market practice must be made plainly visible through our ability to maintain growth and levels of employment by means of a system of open dialogue among the labour market organisations."
"The people of Europe have been concerned, alarmed and puzzled that another war seems to be developing in the Balkans, where small children and the elderly are the ones who are suffering."
"The Cologne summit must succeed in creating a credible single foreign and security policy."
"High level representation alone is not enough; adequate tools for action are needed."
"The European Union must take more overall responsibility in order to ensure that the situation in the Balkans grows more stable and allows different groups to coexist."
"We must also immediately embark on an active programme of cooperation with Russia, just as Germany, as holder of the presidency, has done to its credit."
"The present and future holders of the presidency must create an agenda for advancing the strategy on Russia."
"One important ingredient in this programme is the approval and practical application of the recommended measures to be taken within the context of the northern dimension."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to devote my last speech in the European Parliament to the common foreign and security policy."
"EU enlargement and the events in central Europe oblige us to make a realistic assessment of the possibilities that such a policy offers."
"There is clearly movement within the European Union: Pörtschach, Saint Malo, Bremen, Berlin."
"Cologne could be a historic summit."
"Both Chancellor Schröder and Minister Verheugen have made optimistic statements."
"There is a new awareness of the principles which must form the basis of global policy."
"Europe must now determine its future responsibilities."
"The principle of equal partnership with the United States must be better defined."
"Strategies must be agreed."
"There is a lot that can be decided now, without having to amend the Treaties."
"A different timetable must be adopted than the one proposed by the Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"The Western European Union should be fully integrated into the European Union in 2002, for example."
"In the meantime, someone can already be appointed to be responsible for the common foreign and security policy, together with his or her deputy."
"The Defence Ministers must be granted a responsible role, and we must determine the proper role for the Political Committee."
"We must make it easier to increase cooperation in the field of foreign policy and security."
"Self-planning and analysis can start immediately."
"In the light of Pörtschach it is very important to determine exactly what the 'European pillar' involves."
"It is now time to give real substance to the European defence identity. My hope is that the European Council will understand what is now at stake and make Cologne a success."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is a very good thing that the German Presidency is to give the starting signal for another intergovernmental conference at the EU summit in Cologne."
"We must make progress with the democratisation of the EU."
"The core elements of this are as follows: majority voting as the rule, a new weighting of votes in the Council, structural changes in the Commission and the European Parliament's right of assent on all treaty changes."
"The distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure could also be done away with."
"But if our end is to be democratisation, it must also be the means."
"That is why we have to apply the Community method to future reforms, which means that the Commission must make the first proposals; it is essential, I repeat essential, for the European Parliament to be distinctly more involved!"
"With the Amsterdam Treaty, Agenda 2000 and the euro, the EU has acquired a new quality; with the military operations in Kosovo its face has changed."
"All this also brings us up against the question of the constitution we now have and the constitution that we need."
"It is clear that however much we appreciate the presidents and grandees who presided over the beginning of European integration and the Community treaties, today we must give priority to basic rights and declare confidently that we, the citizens of Europe, are building a Europe of freedom, peace and solidarity."
"Human dignity, justice and the social welfare state are both the means and the end."
"The Biagio De Giovanni resolution sets out a guideline for the years to come."
"The German Government deserves our support for its commitment."
"Mr President, the next few years will determine the new strategy, the new shape of the map of Europe."
"The question is whether we succeed in having a policy which includes the whole continent or whether, through possibly unenlightened choices, we stir up old divisions, create new clashes and open up a kind of trench across the heart of Europe."
"Mr President, the Balkan question must be dealt with, that is certain."
"But to do that it is vital to get Russia firmly involved in the right way."
"Finally that has been understood."
"We ourselves cannot settle these sorts of separation issues."
"The response must be loud and clear."
"I support the programme you have presented: the European constitution and the new Charter that it must include."
"The problems of unemployment must be confronted with renewed vigour."
"I think it is very important that we have spoken with one voice."
"It is vital for European policy that we speak with one voice."
"But we also need to speak with the right voice."
"And the right voice cannot be just the voice of war, it must be a diplomatic voice and a political voice too, capable of finding the space to resolve the problems."
"We are not at war with Serbia, but we are trying to make Serbia respect fundamental human rights, and we need to be able to take advantage of every means available to us."
"There is an opening at the moment."
"The European Union must keep talking and move things even further forward."
"Mr President, I support the proposal for peace and stability."
"Its aims coincide with our established position."
"I want to thank President Santer because, if Parliament is to grow strong, it must also be responsible."
"Too much presumption can sometimes lead to conflicts which cause imbalances."
"That is why we need a European constitution and that is why we need a high level response, which should come from the Cologne summit."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my feeling is that, in addition to enlargement, the European Union is now needs to give specific political responses to a series of problems on which our future really depends. These responses must be understood by the people or, to put it another way, they must be 'user-friendly' for the men and women of Europe."
"At the top of the list is the need for effective coordination of economic policies and for an employment pact. This requires the political will to use the opportunities created by the euro for this purpose."
"We need a security and justice policy which meets the expectations and requirements to defend the freedoms of the people."
"In particular, in view of the Balkan issue, we clearly need, but are genuinely lacking, a common foreign and security policy."
"I agree with those who have said that if the political will existed, the current Treaties could allow us to achieve a great deal."
"The political will to use the current Treaties in this way has been lacking and I fear that when the 'cold war' ends, there are some who may lose the desire for political integration which is at the root of our achievements and of peace in Europe."
"I congratulate the German Presidency of the Council for its decision to hold the Intergovernmental Conference although it may find that this should take place using a Community procedure."
"The institutional reforms or the desire to limit the IGC to the three reforms from Amsterdam, including the weighting of votes and the number of Commissioners, are restrictive. I fear that this is hiding the idea of a return to an intergovernmental Europe with a 'governing body' consisting of the large Member States."
"I am saying this straight out as I feel that this is the essence of many speeches."
"I believe that if we can bring to the fore the idea of a constitutional and citizenship pact, this must primarily imply a reinforced political will for political integration to overcome nationalism. Note that I am saying this at a time when war has reignited in the Balkans."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your contributions to this debate, which I regard as on the whole giving strong encouragement to the German Presidency's programme for the Cologne summit which I have presented. Let me very briefly give my position on four questions that many Members have raised here."
"The first is the question of the basic perspective, the basic strategy."
"Quite contrary to some fears expressed here, it would seem that Europe is coming closer together in face of the crisis and that the processes of integration are acquiring a new dynamic, both internally and in terms of the area covered, quite simply because, as I have said once before in this Parliament, the European alternatives are becoming clearer than ever before in this time of crisis, namely the alternative represented by this Parliament, which is an integrated Europe, a Europe based on peace, stability and prosperity, and on the other side the old picture of Europe that we see in the Balkan wars: nationalism resulting in war, expulsion and misery."
"When we look at these alternatives we see that there is a very distinct trend throughout Europe towards European integration."
"We must exploit and strengthen that trend."
"Let me give a small example. The fact that last week the Council called on the Commission urgently to submit a proposal to conclude association negotiations with Albania and Macedonia means that we are actually 10 to 20 years ahead of time, for under normal circumstances this could not have been envisaged until at least ten years' hence."
"It is the political circumstances that are forcing us to rethink our strategy and really make use of the dynamic that has now been created."
"The second question concerns the Employment Pact."
"Let me say that in terms of substance it is not an employment policy action plan."
"That remains within the remit of the responsible national leaders."
"The Federal Republic of Germany, for instance, has already submitted its national plan and is trying to implement it; it has earmarked DM 2 billion for a special plan to create 100 000 training places and jobs for unemployed young people."
"That is what we expect of the Member States."
"What the European Employment Pact can achieve is a commitment to ends and also to means, and above all macro-economic coordination."
"We should not underestimate the importance of that coordination, for it did not work adequately in the past."
"In this context, the macro-economic dialogue between the institutions on the one hand and with the social partners and the European Central Bank on the other represents a new and important element."
"It is not a question of in any way diminishing the Central Bank's independence, but it obviously must be included in any dialogue on macro-economic coordination."
"After all, it has very crucial instruments available to it and surely it is better for people to sit down together and talk to each other - and the European Central Bank can evaluate the real expectations in Europe - than to engage in public quarrels and battles that cannot produce any practical results."
"My second point in this connection is that of course we must optimise the financial resources and instruments available to the European Union and in particular to the Commission with a view to creating employment."
"As I understood President Santer, the report he intends to submit is aimed at achieving precisely that objective."
"My third point concerns the institutional reforms."
"I would not like to see any misunderstanding arise here."
"What the German Presidency is envisaging is the beginning of a medium and long-term process whose end we cannot even foresee, just as we cannot even foresee its scale."
"Embedded within this process are concrete steps that we can see clearly and that we should take as soon as possible, rather than embarking on some huge reform project that encompasses everything, an intergovernmental conference on a scale never seen before; that would lead to the kind of failure never seen before either."
"The rational course is to decide step by step what can be decided, while always remembering that we are engaged in a more broadly-based process that will basically be a process of social discussion, a process of parliamentary discussion."
"The first two steps are, therefore, as I have said: firstly, to tackle the famous leftovers of Amsterdam and examine the question whether our present situation as regards relations between the institutions will force us to make further changes to the Treaty, and secondly, the charter of basic rights, which, as I said, will have to be formulated by the parliaments."
"My last point goes back to what Mr Tindemans and others have said."
"I am extremely grateful to Mr Tindemans for speaking so plainly, for his urgent appeal that we finally do what we should have done long ago."
"The German Presidency has undertaken to do a great deal here."
"It wants Europe to do more than just speak, but to act, to take a real leap forward now, to actually use the instruments at our disposal, for in the end they are all there."
"They are all there in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"They are all there in the various institutions concerned with security in Europe."
"We just have to put it all together and fashion it into a meaningful whole."
"It is a question of political will and nothing else."
"It is not a question of not having the necessary means or legal bases."
"It is simply a question of political will."
"I cannot foresee today whether the Heads of State and Government will muster this strong political will to take the necessary step and open up the new dimension of integration that we urgently need. But I promise you that we will make every effort to achieve this."
"And all in all I am optimistic, because the situation we now find ourselves in truly does force us to draw the conclusions that should have been drawn a long time ago."

"Mr President, I would like to make a point of order."
"Parliament's services have informed us that this joint debate on Agenda 2000 will begin with statements by the Council and the Commission, which will then be followed first by the speeches by the groups rather than the speeches by the rapporteurs."
"I would like to know if this is correct, and if so, can you tell me on what basis this decision was taken, as it is a totally abnormal procedure?"
"In fact, in my 14 years in this House, I cannot remember a time when the groups spoke before the rapporteurs on any budget report."
"I would like to know if my information is correct and what procedure we are going to follow."
"The decision on this matter was taken at the Conference of Presidents and it is binding on us so we will proceed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Berlin Agenda 2000 package, which accounts for a volume of more than EUR 680 billion, probably contains the most comprehensive reform of EU policies in the history of the Union."
"It includes a solid financial framework up to the year 2006, substantial reforms to the common agricultural policy and to structural policy, as well as changes to the own resources decision that take greater account of the Member States' financial situation and help distribute the burden more fairly."
"Agenda 2000 was concluded in accordance with the timetable fixed by the European Council in Cardiff, which demonstrated that the European Union is able to act under increasingly difficult conditions."
"This prompt agreement paves the way to enlargement eastward."
"It is also an important precondition for the seamless continuation of structural policy as from 1 January 2000."
"Let me briefly repeat the key elements of the reform."
"On the common agricultural policy: the Berlin package contains the widest-reaching reform ever of the common agricultural policy."
"The gradual approximation of support prices to the world market price level, flanked by direct payments, prepares our undertakings for the further liberalisation of world trade that is taking place now."
"Among the key elements of the reform package are the further development of the rural development policy, including improved support for environmentally compatible farming methods."
"On structural policy: the distinct tightening up of structural policy through internal concentration, which means fewer objectives and fewer Community initiatives, and through concentrating the range of supports will increase efficiency."
"The structural resources will be concentrated on the genuinely needy regions, especially by giving clear priority to Objective 1 regions and by continuing the Cohesion Fund."
"An additional priority will be to combat unemployment."
"To that end, the Objective 3 funds, intended to support employment measures, will be increased substantially."
"For the years 2000 to 2006, a total of EUR 24 billion will be made available."
"On the financing system: the European Council has recognised that there are still budgetary imbalances in the financing of the Union and has provided for changes to the existing own resources system in order to take more account of the Member States' ability to pay and thus make their contributions fairer."
"In the Council's view, it is particularly important that in spite of these comprehensive reforms it proved possible to stabilise expenditure."
"The ceiling of EU expenditure remains 1.27 % of the European Union's gross national product, and we will continue to remain below this ceiling."
"In the year 2006, expenditure will account for 1.13 % of the EU's gross national product."
"That is equivalent to the 1999 value."
"The resources allocated to enlargement up to the year 2006 are included in this figure, in this 1.13 %."
"The expenditure for the EU of 15 members is to be EUR 686 billion up to 2006 and will be kept constant in real terms, which means that for the first time we will now also be achieving at European level what the Member States have already achieved, namely strict budgetary discipline, strict expenditure discipline and keeping budgetary increases in line with economic requirements."
"In real terms, agricultural expenditure will be restricted to an average of EUR 40.5 billion a year for market measures plus about EUR 13 billion for rural development over the period 2000 to 2006."
"That means that agricultural expenditure will be stabilised at the 1999 level."
"The Agenda 2000 reform package represents a major step towards enlargement."
"In agricultural policy, by placing more emphasis on the world market and the environment, we will now be giving agriculture in the accession countries a good basis for agricultural policy planning."
"That will make it easier for them to integrate in the European single market."
"A sum of about EUR 22 billion is being made available for pre-accession aid, together with a further EUR 58 billion for enlargement-related expenditure, which means that over the financing period a total of EUR 80 billion is available for enlargement, although it can only be spent if enlargement actually takes place."
"These resources cannot be transferred for other purposes."
"As regards financial precautions, as I have already pointed out we are still below the own resources ceiling, which means we have a quite considerable financial margin of 0.14 % of the EU gross national product to provide for unforeseen expenditure."
"What is crucial now is for the political decisions to be implemented rapidly by the adoption of the necessary legal acts, i.e. the prompt conclusion of the legislative procedure."
"I want to stress that we are all responsible for the success of this historic reform package."
"It is now up to the European Parliament to decide on Agenda 2000."
"Let me point out that the conciliation procedure agreed between the Austrian Presidency and Parliament has proved to be extremely successful and useful."
"Parliament was kept fully informed on a regular basis of the progress of work on Agenda 2000 and the Commission and the Council took account of Parliament's views in their deliberations."
"There was not just an exchange of ideas but a genuine process of mutual influence, which I felt was extremely important and which also went a very long way to meet Parliament's view of itself as an institution with a genuine say."
"So I am confident that the European Parliament will take a responsible approach in exercising its rights to participate in the decisions on the regulations on the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund."
"Let me point out again that the presidency has made considerable efforts to achieve a result that pleases and satisfies all parties concerned, not just Parliament but the Member States too."
"If you will allow me, I will make a personal comment now - after all this is probably also my last appearance in the European Parliament. It is interesting to note that an agenda such as Agenda 2000 is of course also a fight between the Member States for the money available for distribution."
"Indeed a very large sum of money has to be distributed."
"That is why it was not really surprising to find that prior to the Cologne summit there was criticism from various sides about the presidency's strategy, about the way the negotiations were conducted; but since the Berlin summit, the situation has been assessed quite differently."
"All the European capitals have voiced unanimous praise and agreement, which shows that we have achieved what we wanted to achieve."
"Nobody won in Berlin, and nobody lost either."
"Everyone made their contribution to the compromise and everyone gained something from this compromise."
"In that respect I think I am entitled to say that it was a successful summit."
"I would like to thank all the committee members, the chairmen of the committees involved and Parliament's rapporteurs for their good cooperation over the past months."
"I do not think I need at this point give a detailed list of the many amendments proposed by Parliament and which the Council accepted."
"You know all that."
"But I would like to mention the most recent example of the Council's willingness to compromise with Parliament, namely the fact that the URBAN Community initiative is now being continued thanks to Parliament's pressure."
"We also managed to find a compromise solution on the question of the financing of URBAN."
"Moreover, the Council stated that it was prepared to negotiate at a given time about making up to EUR 200 million available from the budget's flexibility reserve to offset the cost of innovative measures."
"That is a good example of the successful cooperation between the Council and Parliament."
"I also had a strong personal commitment to the success of this agenda, which is why I appeal to you to approve the package before you."
"I believe that both sides, the Council and Parliament, have done as much as they could."
"There are still some wishes that have not been satisfied, nobody disputes that."
"We, I, the presidency, still have some wishes that were not satisfied."
"But we must never forget that this kind of negotiated result simply represents what 15 Member States can do together at a given time, and given that we were 15, we could do no more."
"We could perhaps have achieved more had we been 14, or 13 or 12, but not with 15 Member States."
"What we have before us is what the 15 can achieve at this point in time."
"Parliament can do more, I know that, but when you take your decision please do not forget that the Member States are firmly convinced that they have reached the limits of what they can do."
"It is also necessary in the interest of the people, of the citizens of Europe, for the necessary regulations to be adopted and for there to be no delays."
"Many European regions have to adjust to the changes resulting from Agenda 2000."
"We should not ask them to accept a period of insecurity and uncertainty."
"Thank you for your attention!"
"Applause"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Agenda 2000 is being adopted against the background of the Kosovo crisis."
"Nothing could make it clearer how important it is to safeguard and deepen European integration."
"As European history has shown, it takes far more than the absence of war for societies to develop peacefully in the long term."
"Democracy, respect for human rights, tolerance, security and economic and social stability form the basis of the success of the EU and the personal welfare of each individual."
"The humanitarian disaster in Kosovo makes enlargement eastward and the democratic and economic stabilisation of the Balkans even more urgent, in the interests not only of the people in Central and Eastern Europe but also of our own security."
"Against this background, we cannot overestimate the importance of financially safeguarding the enlargement process through Agenda 2000 and of the positive signal the Community is thereby giving the states applying for accession."
"But we must do more than this, which is why it is right and necessary that over and above Agenda 2000 the Council has also declared itself willing to cover the additional resources needed for the Balkans by, if necessary, reviewing the financial perspective."
"So far Europe has been able to develop a social system that broadly guarantees democracy, cultural diversity, competitiveness and solidarity."
"The various pillars - the single market, economic and monetary union and promoting economic and social cohesion - have helped achieve that."
"Agenda 2000 safeguards these pillars and allows us to further develop the European system for the future."
"The adoption by the European Parliament of Agenda 2000 will conclude a two-year process of intensive discussions and negotiations."
"By in a sense anticipating Amsterdam, if I may put it that way, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament have proved through a process of increasingly close coordination and positive give and take that it is possible to achieve results that will help the EU as a whole to make progress."
"It makes no difference that this is a genuine compromise, meaning that not everyone could obtain all they wanted, and that it is a compromise that produces more satisfactory results in some areas than in others."
"Let me thank the presidencies involved, and in particular the presidency of the Council and Chancellor Schröder, for the fact that they managed, by persevering with the negotiations, to bring about agreement between the Member States."
"That was a success for Europe during a difficult time."
"And let me thank Parliament not just for the numerous improvements to the original proposals but above all for its constructive approach and the great flexibility it displayed, which made it possible to reach agreement so quickly."
"I have already said that not everything has been resolved in an equally satisfactory manner."
"Mr Fischler will talk about this in detail later in relation to agricultural policy."
"The Commission regrets that it did not prove possible in Berlin to adopt at least those reforms that the agriculture ministers had already decided."
"The watering down of the reforms in the cereals and milk sector raises a number of questions."
"The review clause in the cereals sector shows that the Heads of State and Government have not even excluded the possibility, perhaps indeed the necessity, of further improvements."
"With the postponement of the milk reform to the end of the 2000-2006 period, the costs of the reform were merely postponed to the next financing period, without removing the market imbalances."
"But one positive aspect I would like to emphasise is that the Council has adopted the Commission's proposals on the second pillar, on the consolidation of rural development policy, almost unchanged."
"That not only underpins sustainable development in the rural regions but also gives the European Parliament a new power of codecision on agricultural matters, for in future this expenditure will be shown as non-compulsory."
"So that too satisfies a major demand by Parliament."
"The division of the traditional agricultural guideline into two sub-headings that this calls for will in fact require stricter budgetary discipline in the organisations of the markets."
"But overall, the agricultural reform is an important step towards a competitive agriculture in Europe."
"The second major pillar of Agenda 2000 is the reform of regional and cohesion policy."
"It is a sign of the close cooperation between all concerned that this reform strengthens the policy of social and economic cohesion in the European Union."
"Even if the financial resources for the next funding period remain a little below what the Commission originally proposed, one major success is that the level of Community solidarity with the poorest and structurally weakest regions of the Union is being maintained without any cutbacks and that the Cohesion Fund is being continued."
"In this context I think it is important to point out that the Structural Funds, with their declining expenditure profile, make an important contribution to consolidating the budget, although Community solidarity with the structurally weakest regions remains fixed at the highest level of the last funding period, namely at the level of 1999."
"That was only possible because this time the principle of concentration really could be applied successfully."
"The structurally weakest Objective 1 regions will receive not just two thirds but this time as much as 70 % of all Structural Funds resources."
"The criteria relating to eligibility for aid and to the level of that aid are not just objective and transparent, they are also being observed strictly and without exception and I believe that is an important point which will also be significant for the future."
"In regard to implementation and management, we will in future look to decentralisation, a clear distribution of tasks and responsibilities, building up partnership at all levels and substantially improving monitoring, control and evaluation."
"Since the European Court of Auditors and Parliament's Committee on Budgets have taken a very positive view of these aspects of the Commission's proposal, I am confident that this has created the conditions for better control in future than in the past by the Commission, the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors of the financial settlement and efficiency of the resources allocated."
"But above all, the principle of concentration means concentration on the Union's political priorities."
"So all the Structural Funds will now concentrate on creating secure jobs for the future, which means employment-intensive growth, strengthening the competitiveness and innovative power of the regions, sustainable development and promoting skills and equal opportunities."
"That applies in particular to the European Social Fund, which Mr Flynn will be discussing in more detail later on."
"As an instrument of labour market policy and of the development of human resources, it will also form the core of the European employment strategy, an active labour market policy."
"Equal access to the employment market for all, lifelong learning, the adaptability of workers and undertakings and positive actions in favour of women are key elements here."
"We cannot have an effective structural policy unless we establish closer partnership."
"Here the Commission fully agrees with the European Parliament and I am sure that Parliament will ensure in future too that adequate attention is paid to this in the everyday implementation of the Structural Funds reform."
"Partnership between the Commission and Parliament also includes the code of conduct that we have agreed."
"Parliament has also succeeded in its call for all the structural measures for fisheries to be brought together under Category 2 and for unified horizontal planning."
"At the last minute, as Mr Verheugen pointed out, it even proved possible to strengthen the urban dimension of the Structural Funds through the fourth Community initiative, URBAN, called for by Parliament."
"Agenda 2000 is also the necessary condition for the enlargement process."
"With its pre-accession aid and the gradual inclusion of the Central and Eastern European countries, the agenda is mobilising a package of EUR 80 billion for economic development in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Here it is drawing on proven instruments to reduce infrastructure weaknesses in transport and the environment and it will try to ensure that these instruments are effectively linked to the existing PHARE and Interreg instruments."
"It is important to the implementation of the Agenda 2000 package for the new interinstitutional agreement to establish a solid, seven-year financial framework."
"Agreement was reached on the following points during the negotiations."
"By limiting expenditure, the EU is contributing to budgetary consolidation on a Europe-wide basis."
"At the same time, the financing of Community policy is guaranteed in the medium term."
"Moreover, the financial distribution system is fairer."
"I know that not all Members are convinced of the merits of the proposed interinstitutional agreement."
"That is why I would stress that it is also in Parliament's interest that the implementation of Agenda 2000 is not jeopardised by annual budgetary conflicts."
"Mr Liikanen will be confirming this when he gives his views later."
"At any rate the Commission believes that it is very much thanks to the European Parliament that the necessary budgetary discipline will not create a burden for the poorest members of the Community, that at the same time this expenditure discipline enables us to tie up an important enlargement package and that we have achieved additional margins for manoeuvre in internal policy areas and in regard to administrative tasks, which will enable us on the one hand to underpin the emerging economic and employment upswing and on the other to put the administration in a position really to shoulder the additional new tasks."
"In light of the debates we have had here in past months, I believe that is an important common aim."
"The Agenda 2000 reforms encompass EU policy areas that directly concern the people of Europe."
"These proposals open up new personal prospects for many people."
"It is your privilege, by the adoption of the legislative proposals on Agenda 2000, to lay an important foundation stone not just for fulfilling the expectations of our people but also for the Europe of the future."
"That is why I hope they will find broad support and on behalf of the entire Commission let me say that I am grateful for the excellent cooperation with the European Parliament on the Agenda 2000 package."
"Applause"
"Thank you Commissioner Wulf-Mathies."
"The debate will be resumed at 3 p.m. this afternoon."
"Mr Skinner has the floor on a point of order."
"Mr President, yesterday the Council's representatives agreed to an effective ban across the European Union on white asbestos and yet there are some concerns that there will be unnecessary delays in the signature of this particular document, which Parliament has played a very positive role in bringing to the fore."
"Could we use your good offices to ensure that we encourage the Commission to take the steps needed to avoid any unnecessary delays?"
"Thank you very much."
"I will do that."
"VOTES"
"My congratulations to the President-designate."
"Standing ovation"
"Welcome"
"At the request of Mr Cox, I should like to welcome Mr Dedaj, chairman of the Liberal Party of Kosovo and Vice-President of the Kosovo Parliament, who is present with us in the official gallery."
"Loud and sustained applause"
"VOTES (continuation)"
"Mr President, I do not think you can suspect me of wanting to prevent us from having a statute for Members by using procedural tricks."
"However, as chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, I would like to say that I do not consider Amendments Nos 2 and 25 to be admissible, pursuant to Rule 125 of our Rules of Procedure."
"In my view, these two amendments aim to replace at least two, if not three, paragraphs of the resolution presented to us and, as a result, I do not believe that they are admissible."
"I would also like to say that Parliament is not doing itself any great favours by seeking to push its Rules of Procedure to their limits in order to fulfil political objectives."
"Having said that, I am completely in favour of a statute for Members of the European Parliament and believe that it should be introduced as soon as possible, but not by means of a violation of Parliament's procedures and of our Rules of Procedure."
"Applause"
"Yes, Mr Fayot, we have examined these amendments very carefully."
"They do not replace the text in its entirety, but only part of the text."
"Mixed reactions"
"That is why, after consulting the services responsible, we decided that they were admissible."
"Moreover, the Legal Affairs Committee, which had some doubts, held a vote in a very similar case on one of the proposed texts, which was rejected."
"Mr President, I agree with Mr Fayot: it is irresponsible to adopt a text for a statute that could not be examined in the committees!"
"Applause"
"I also want to raise another point of order."
"I have the official voting list at hand."
"I see that on paragraph 1 you want to begin with Amendment No 2."
"Let me point out that my group tabled an Amendment No 27 to delete paragraph 1."
"There can hardly be an amendment that departs further from the text than one that deletes a paragraph."
"So I would ask you to begin by voting on Amendment No 27."
"Applause"
"Mr Rothley, although the services responsible inform me that the other amendments depart further from the text, I agree with you that an amendment seeking to delete a paragraph is always the one that departs furthest from the text."
"So everyone will naturally know what they will have to vote on later."
"This is not a matter of judging votes in advance; we are trying to comply with the Rules of Procedure."
"And in my view, an amendment that seeks to delete a paragraph always departs further from the text than an amendment that seeks to replace it."
"As a result, as the rapporteur said, we will vote firstly on Amendment No 27, which seeks to delete the paragraph from the rapporteur's resolution."
"I am very sorry, but I must comply with the Rules."
"We are therefore going to begin with the vote on Amendment No 27."
"Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, we have a very long vote ahead of us and we must get through it peacefully."
"We are not going to open a debate on the Rules now."
"Once again, I am sorry, but we must proceed with the vote."
"Mr President, I would simply like to make a point of order pursuant to Rules 4 and 125."
"The French Members from the National Front are present in the House."
"However, we will not take part in the vote on the amendments for a fundamental legal reason: we are national Members representing 15 different nations, not a single European nation."
"Moreover, to accept a statute for Members of the European Parliament would be to change our status from being a matter of international law to being a matter of internal constitutional law."
"We do not want that, which is why we will not take part in the vote."
"Mixed reactions"
"Very well, that is your right."
"We note the fact that you are present, but not taking part in the vote."
"Mr President, I am somewhat surprised that Members are forced to act as if they are in a fairground to be able to speak in Parliament. However, apart from that, I would simply like to say that this is the first time that I have seen in a House such as ours a situation where two opposing views are set out, one by the services responsible and the other by the chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure - who is elected by his peers - and where that of the relevant services has prevailed."
"No, Mr Lehideux, it is not the services, but the President who interprets the Rules of Procedure, and so the decision is entirely mine and my responsibility."
"That is the decision which has been taken."
"As always, I accept responsibility for the decisions which I take, be they right or wrong."
"Parliament adopted the resolution"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the votes on the Rothley report on the Statute for Members, I can only confirm that the opinion delivered by the Commission pursuant to Article 190(5) of the Amsterdam Treaty stands unchanged."
"Applause"
"Madam President, after 10 years the circle is complete."
"My first report in this House concerned the basis of Europe's development policy towards Asia and Latin America."
"In that report, or in the Commission's proposal, there was no mention of women, displaced persons and certainly not the environment."
"None of this was there."
"The words simply did not appear in the text."
"Today they lie at the very heart of Europe's development policy."
"We have just voted on my latest report in which we introduce a budget heading for environmental policy in the context of development policy."
"I should like to thank all my colleagues for the way we have been able to work together over the past 10 years."
"I have an announcement to make."
"Those Members who are obliged to leave the sitting are asked to leave their card in the appropriate voting terminal."
"Since I have to make this announcement and this is the last voting time over which I shall preside, I should like to take the opportunity to say how much I have appreciated your cooperation, and to give my best wishes to the House."
"The House rose to applaud Mrs Fontaine"
"Madam President, perhaps we will have to invite Mr Romano Prodi to attend our explanations of vote, but I imagine that this situation will not arise again during the next Parliament."
"I simply want to tell him, on behalf of the French Socialists, that we voted in favour of his appointment today by a large majority."
"However, I would like to remind him that we are committed to a Europe of the heart, a Europe of solidarity, and not a Europe of markets alone."
"We have already experimented with the formulas of a lesser role for the state and the blind belief that the rules of competition or liberalisation generate employment."
"We no longer believe in them."
"We know that to create jobs again we will need further growth and growth that will actually generate employment."
"And we would call on Mr Prodi to present us with proposals in that direction."
"Equally, in terms of a social Europe, our people would not understand why no progress was being made."
"I would like to make one final comment, Madam President."
"At a time when a war is breaking out in our continent, we do not understand how religious diversity is not respected."
"As far as we are concerned, the principle of secularism is a founding principle of our Union."
"Non-discrimination as regards religion has been enshrined in our Treaty."
"We will judge Mr Prodi on his respect for this commitment."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the appointment of Mr Romano Prodi."
"His speech before Parliament was marked by the most traditional form of liberalism; it was dull and lacking in any vision for the future."
"There is nothing in his statements that refers clearly to the need to defend and update the European social model."
"There is nothing about the need for a new pact that balances the forces of labour and the holders of capital."
"There is nothing about the redistribution of wealth."
"The social Europe does not concern him."
"But it does concern millions of Europeans."
"He is not proposing any serious strategy to promote employment, preferring to suggest that we simply follow the same monetarist macro-economic policy we have been following for years, a policy that has proved ineffective in terms of establishing sustainable growth and significantly reducing unemployment."
"He made a long plea regarding the need to continue with deregulation and the liberalisation of all sectors of the economy."
"I did not hear him defending general interest services or public services."
"In short, his commitments have very little to do with the hopes and expectations of the people, who have demonstrated their desire for change and elected Socialist or Social Democrat governments in most of our countries."
"Mr Prodi is telling them that tomorrow will be just like yesterday."
"We cannot accept that."
"I was also surprised to see Mr Prodi making an explicit reference to Christian values as a form of heritage that should be defended in Europe."
"Of course, I am not raising any objections to these values, nor am I denying Mr Prodi his freedom of conscience, but I support the principle of secularism - which rightly guarantees this fundamental liberty everywhere and for everyone - and I therefore expect a President of the Commission to uphold this principle."
"But I have my doubts about that."
"Mr Prodi has the right to be a Christian Democrat, but I expect the European Union, where most of the governments are left-wing, to be led by someone who is likely to embody these ideals and these policies."
"That does not seem to be the case."
"Madam President, I have no confidence in President-designate Romano Prodi because he has justified NATO's war by calling it 'necessary'."
"This is a war in Europe initiated and conducted in violation of every principle of international law, in contempt of the United Nations."
"The Treaty establishing the Atlantic Alliance states that it is a defensive organisation, but NATO's war in Yugoslavia actually perverts the nature of that vocation."
"So a dark and bloody conflict has broken out on our continent, and now no one is in any position to predict the outcome or calculate the consequences for the future of our European peoples."
"By calling for an the immediate end to the ethnic massacres and the bombing, in the name of the 'European soul', President-designate Romano Prodi could have taken an influential and balanced role, decisive for the future work of the Commission."
"He did not do so, he identified himself with the interventionists, and lost a precious and long-awaited opportunity."
"Applause from the left"
"I voted in favour of the nominee for President this time round, whereas in July 1994 I voted against Mr Santer."
"Unfortunately, I was not mistaken then, as events have now demonstrated."
"I hope that the political will indicated by Mr Prodi to reestablish the balance between the institutions will bear fruit so that the Commission can reassume its essential political driving role as a body independent of the national governments and private interests."
"To do this, the European Parliament must also fulfil its role in order to avoid the return to an intergovernmental Europe with a 'governing body' consisting of the large Member States."
"However, I must indicate my extreme surprise and condemnation of the way in which Mr Prodi, on page 11 of the verbatim report of proceedings, characterised the European consciousness, which is at the root of the integration achieved in the last 50 years. He described this as being exclusively 'erede della cultura umanística e della cultura cristiana ' meaning that it has its origins in humanism and Christianity."
"This characterisation diminishes the origins of European civilisation by specifically disregarding the contribution of the Jewish and Muslim cultures."
"The use of the term 'cristiana ' or 'Christian' is not only an unacceptable falsification of history but also, given the current events in Europe, an unpardonable political error."
"Our House is today giving its opinion on the appointment of Mr Prodi as President of the European Commission."
"I must vote against this appointment and withhold my vote of confidence."
"Mr Prodi, you appeared as the saviour of a foundering institution, as the person who could provide the charisma needed for the job."
"But your obviously strong personality cannot be separated from the objective of your politics."
"Moreover, having listened to your comments and to your programme, I am extremely concerned."
"Since the beginning of my term in office, I have fought to change the prevailing philosophy within the Brussels executive. I have fought to ensure that the liberal Europe, the Europe of markets, gave way to a social Europe."
"After listening to you yesterday, I am disappointed that not a single reference was made to the social Europe."
"There was not a word about the concept of public services; instead, we listened to a eulogy to economic liberalism."
"Mr Prodi, you refuse to distinguish between the market-based Europe and the social Europe."
"But you must be aware that our people cannot support the European idea if the only option available is a market where the role of the individual is obsolete."
"You will have the difficult task of establishing Europe in a new millennium, and I cannot get used to the idea that the twenty-first century might represent a negation of the social Europe."
"You succeeded in the formidable task of enabling your country to join the euro."
"I hoped that, with your appointment, you would establish the proper social dimension that Europe requires."
"I did not hear this in your speech and you have disappointed me."
"I therefore cannot give you a free hand to carry out this role."
"I have today voted against the approval of Romano Prodi as the new President of the Commission."
"Mr Prodi has not been sufficiently convincing in his acknowledgement of the need for a social Europe."
"All we have heard is that tired old tune about full liberalisation and more growth being the solution to Europe's problems."
"He has not voiced the desire to make active use of the new provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty with regard to the environment or employment."
"Mr Prodi's future plans for the development of Europe also go too far in a federal direction."
"Amongst other things, he is seeking to extend European cooperation in the fields of defence and foreign affairs."
"His ambitions in the sphere of equal opportunities have unfortunately also been non-existent."
"Mr Prodi has not outlined any plans for greater equality between men and women either within the college of Commissioners or in the Directorates-General."
"Romano Prodi's ambitions in the human and social sectors are therefore too slight to persuade me to vote in favour of his nomination."
"At the time, I voted in favour of the appointment of Jacques Santer as President of the Commission, in the knowledge that he had been prime minister of a small country, like my own, but one that had been much less affected by extra-European immigration, by unemployment and by taxation. I warned him about accepting the best and the worst in terms of the heads of the various departments; unfortunately, the worst prevailed."
"Mr Prodi's speech could not have been more disappointing."
"He talked to us for a long time about the Europe of money."
"He did not say a word about the Europe of people."
"He did not provide us with any hope that we might be able to put an end to the new world order imposed by the Yankees."
"There was no condemnation, or even regret, in relation to the unacceptable military attack against a European nation by a NATO that is blindly killing women and children."
"I cannot in all conscience put my trust in a politician who has joined the camp of the enemies of Europe."
"I abstained in the election of the President of the Commission, as I could not see how I could give my support to Mr Prodi."
"His appearance in the European Parliament was not enough to reassure me that he would be the right person to lead the Commission during the next five-year term."
"Mr Prodi's bottom line is the formation of a Federal Europe, which is difficult for me to accept."
"Most worrying of all when Mr Prodi was here in Parliament were his ideas on employment, the regulation of the labour market and the public sector."
"He repeatedly stressed the need to deregulate the labour market and to increase the practice of bilateral agreements between employers and workers."
"He considered the public sector to be too large in scale and called for rationalisation and cost-cutting measures."
"Meanwhile, he had nothing more than pious messages of hope for increased employment."
"Mr Prodi sets great store by a common defence policy for Europe."
"He failed to give adequate guarantees that non-aligned EU Member States would be able to remain outside the military alliance."
"Nevertheless, I did not consider I could vote against his appointment, as that would mean a serious delay in appointing the new Commission."
"With the situation as it is, it is important that the new Commission should begin work as soon as possible."
"Mr Prodi did not at first sight seem to have all the qualities required for a necessarily strong and active leadership of the European Union."
"Due to their style and beliefs, other people were better qualified to preside over the Commission."
"However, his experience in Italian politics, his acknowledged personal and political integrity and his capacity for establishing dialogue and unity are basic virtues which can breathe life into the European project."
"Through his speeches in Parliament, he has gradually outlined his beliefs on Europe. These contain many positive aspects, particularly the desire to guarantee the independence of the Commission and to carry out a root-and-branch reform of its administrative practices."
"We would also highlight the importance which Mr Prodi has placed on Mediterranean policies, which he regards as being just as important as enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, his will to help make the European economy more dynamic and reduce unemployment and, essentially for us, the defence of economic and social cohesion."
"We note, however, that the social side was virtually totally absent from his speeches, which is worrying."
"Overall, there are reasons why we have high expectations of the new Commission President and this is why we are voting in favour of his appointment."
"We now hope that our expectations can be reinforced and that Mr Prodi can be the President the Commission needs following the period of weakness we have seen with Mr Santer."
"The Portuguese Socialists support a strong Commission which is capable of mobilising the will of the European people and which respects these people and their legitimate interests, particularly in small countries such as Portugal."
"We also demand an independent Commission which, within the structure of the Community institutions, can contribute to achieving a balance between all the Member States, whether small or large and whether in the south or north of Europe."
"I had decided to vote in favour of the appointment of Mr Prodi as President of the European Commission. I was satisfied with both the speed and efficiency with which the Council had taken its decision and with the standing in European terms of a man who, with great panache and know-how, had led a left-wing Italian Government under difficult conditions and had led Italy into EMU."
"However, his speech yesterday worried me and I have now decided to abstain."
"Parliament, and in particular my group, the Socialist Group, has often highlighted the need to balance the economic and monetary pillar with a social pillar and a firm commitment to a political Europe."
"What I listened to yesterday was a liberal credo that leads me to fear greatly that this new balance is not on the agenda of the next Commission."
"Moreover, my secular view of public life was shattered."
"That is why I am abstaining. I hope that my fears will not be justified and, in any event, that the vigilance of the next Parliament and its commitment to a social Europe will ensure that they are unfounded."
"We have voted against the appointment of Romano Prodi as President of the Commission for the following reasons."
"Romano Prodi has indicated that he is in favour of the EU developing on federal lines into a kind of United States of Europe."
"He has repeatedly stressed the need for a common defence and hence the militarisation of the EU."
"In his address and in answers to questions, it is noticeable that he has often compared the EU to the USA, with a view to establishing a 'balance over the Atlantic'."
"We are opposed to the development of an 'EU state' and believe that European cooperation should, for the most part, be based on intergovernmental cooperation between independent nations."
"The appointment of the President of the Commission and the Commission provides us with a good opportunity to carry out reforms which would reinforce democracy in Europe."
"The EU should have a modern administration and transparent legislation along the lines of the Nordic model. This would mean open Council meetings and public access to official records, whereby everyone would be entitled to examine public documents and records in all the EU institutions and to speak out freely, in other words to be able to inform the media and those outside the EU institutions about mistakes and wrong-doing in the administration."
"Moreover, reforms to increase openness should be extended to the system of appointments in the EU institutions."
"An appointment should only be made following an application and on the basis of qualifications, not political patronage."
"All employees should be aware that proficiency and merit, not friendship and connections, are the requirements for being appointed."
"The Commission should be decentralised in order to allow staff to exercise responsibility and authority."
"The concentration of responsibility in the hands of a minority should be broken."
"Staff reforms should be carried out in order to weed out EU privileges."
"It is indefensible that an employee in the EU earns three times as much for doing the same job as he or she would in a Member State, and enjoys diplomatic status with immunity from punishment and other fringe benefits."
"The salary of the President of the Commission should also have been reduced before an appointment was made."
"Commissioners should receive the same salary as ministers in the country which they represent."
"Moving expenses should be paid on the basis of an estimate and not in the form of two months' additional salary of around SEK 360 000."
"The EU should concentrate on the big issues, distinguish between what is trivial and what is important, and carry out genuine decentralising reforms which would result in matters that should not be dealt with at EU level being handed back to the Member States."
"All these reform proposals should be implemented, but no such promise has been given."
"Our vision is one of free European people in a democratic and diverse Europe."
"We do not want a United States of Europe, but a Europe of nations."
"After listening to Mr Prodi's speech before Parliament, we cannot have any doubts as to his desire to clean up and improve the functioning of the Commission, but equally, we do not have any doubts as to his desire to continue to build a liberal Europe where no consideration is given to the role of workers."
"He did not say a word about social dialogue, about public services or about the need to establish the core of fundamental social rights we require to prevent relocations through fiscal dumping."
"The fact that Mr Prodi was actually nominated by 11 Socialist or Social Democrat governments proves that the social Europe is not the priority and that the liberal approach has not been discarded."
"Nonetheless, I am convinced that the rights of the people of Europe will only improve if we build a strong, political Europe based on the principle of secularism."
"To achieve this, we must reopen the divide between the right and the left, turn Parliament into a truly political body and stop looking for consensus, as the governments did when nominating Mr Prodi."
"That is why I am opposed to his nomination as head of the Commission."
"I was foolish enough to believe that the future President of the Commission, Mr Romano Prodi, would send us an ambitious message to enable us to emerge from the institutional and political crisis that led to the resignation of the Commission, against the backdrop of the war in Kosovo."
"Unfortunately, apart from some general statements and the promise of rigorous and transparent management, his speech gave me greater cause for concern than for anything else."
"After Jacques Delors and the very liberal Commissioner, Mr Bangemann, he in turn is conforming to the myth of the overriding power of the Internet and information highways and is promising us paradise through the fact that 'we can bridge the gap between us and the United States'."
"To respond to these global challenges, we must inevitably 'reform the welfare model' and 'review ... the rules governing labour markets and professional markets to lower the barriers preventing access and ... make the employment situation more responsive to economic growth'."
"Naturally, as Mr Prodi goes on to tell us, this will only happen if we can 'make public administrations lighter of touch'."
"In spite of the first stinging failure of the MAI, Mr Prodi himself is taking up Commissioner Brittan's ideology: 'The EU should continue along the path of multilateral liberalisation within the World Trade Organisation."
"Our aim is to prevent all attempts at protectionism ...'."
"Following the example of the United States, will the future Commission look on our social and environmental clauses as protectionist?"
"It is vital to include them in our trade mechanisms to ensure that globalisation is based on cooperation and solidarity with the poorest regions and countries."
"But the final blow to a progressive European project is perhaps his idea of European culture: he seems to consider this in terms of the past and believes it to be our only heritage."
"For the future, he turns to 'the power of American culture', which 'in the broad sense and as expressed in symbolic form by the media is actually believed by some to be capable of acting as a single point of reference for a Europe in quest of its soul."
"There is nothing discreditable about such a supposition ...'"
"In other words, just a few months before the WTO negotiations, Mr Prodi's Europe is surrendering before having even waged the political war."
"The liberal European hymn sung by Romano Prodi is based on the flexibility and adaptability of work, mistrust of public services and allegiance to American culture."
"As a result, I voted against his appointment as President of the Commission."
"The European Parliament's endorsement of Mr Prodi as President of the Commission, which I was very happy to vote in favour of, opens up a new era for the European Union at what is a turning point for Europe and the world as a whole."
"In conjunction with the European elections on 13 June 1999, the European Union needs to confirm its unswerving dedication to the principles of democracy, solidarity, justice, transparency, stability and peace."
"The people of Europe - of the 15 Member States and the applicant countries of Eastern Europe and Cyprus - hope and demand that the European Union becomes a real political and social union, with the required authority and validity to play a leading world role as we approach the millennium."
"I voted to approve Mr Prodi's nomination, but with reservations."
"The overriding priority of the incoming Commission President should be to ensure good management and financial control within the Commission."
"It should not be to increase European integration or to build a federal Europe."
"To coin a phrase, the European Union should do less, better."
"Although I voted for Mr Prodi as President of the Commission, I do not accept the strongly federalist views regarding a common defence and a common system of taxation that were put forward by Mr Prodi in his policy statement."
"Sweden joined on the basis of intergovernmental cooperation, it did not join a federation."
"In my view, Mr Prodi does not represent traditional social democratic policy either, which I would have preferred."
"Madam President, obviously in this House we are parliamentarians and democrats."
"As a democrat I have to accept the result of the vote on the Rothley report even if I do not agree with it."
"As a parliamentarian I have to accept that we use procedures sometimes as a way of either promoting or shielding ourselves from particular votes."
"I want to express my deep sense of disappointment that yesterday, at an early stage, when my group presented to other group presidents the possibility of trying to find a reasonable way forward, whereby the Council would meet tonight and then, tomorrow, we could decide on the issue in a more definitive way, some colleagues used procedures in this House to block that possibility."
"I express in particular my grave disappointment at Amendment No 27 in the name of Mrs Green and Mr Cot, who removed Article 1 from the Rothley report and ipso facto removed from it the possibility of the Liberal amendment."
"That amendment genuinely sought to address many of the fears that Members had expressed as deficiencies in the Council's response."
"For example, it put MEPs on an equal footing with national parliamentary representatives in the matter of various allowances and expenses."
"It included clauses on the acquired rights, the so-called 'grandfather clause'."
"It included options for early retirement, which many Members said they wanted."
"It included the full protection of the acquired pension rights, the existing pension rights of Members, and other elements as well."
"In all of that it was a genuine attempt to recognise that the Rothley report simpliciter of last December clearly will not win unanimous approval of the Council; that the Council's text of last week clearly will not win the support of this House."
"And this via media which we sought to bring forward - and as democrats we have to accept the win or loss - was blown out of the water by a procedure which disgusts me."
"Madam President, clearly, as Mr Cox has mentioned, the amendment tabled in my name on behalf of the Socialist Group was tabled by the Socialist Group."
"As the leader, I had my name on it, but for the record, I voted against it."
"Madam President, I was not aware of that."
"I thank Mrs Green for that explanation."
"Personally, I had understood that was her position."
"I thank her for clarifying it."
"I still remain disgusted by the procedure but I would wish, at least, to place on the record my appreciation of what Mrs Green has just said."
"Madam President, I should like to put on record my disgust as well at what has happened."
"Madam President, the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations did not agree with the draft uniform Statute for Members of the European Parliament adopted by our House on 3 December 1998."
"We believed at the time, and we still believe, that the Members of the European Parliament represent their respective nations and that they should continue to have the status of national representatives."
"Since 3 December, the Council has examined Parliament's draft and has unfortunately approved its key principles."
"In its view, the Members of the European Parliament should from now on be paid out of the Community budget and not by their countries of origin."
"Moreover, they should pay income tax to the Communities, under the same conditions as those that apply to European officials."
"Only a temporary derogation is provided for to maintain the national system of taxation for those countries which request it explicitly."
"This amended draft is equally unacceptable."
"It is totally incredible that the Members of the European Parliament might be paid by someone other than the people they represent."
"It is equally incredible that they might be subject to a tax system that is different from that of their fellow citizens, particularly if this is also a less severe tax system, as would be the case here."
"This reform is obviously designed to draw Members away from defending their people in order to encourage them to defend the supranational system that will support them."
"It is somewhat difficult to understand the deep-rooted motives of the Council when it accepts a text that is so opposed to the interests of the Member States, unless it, too, agrees tacitly to the establishment of a European superstate."
"This interpretation unfortunately seems to be correct, as it is backed up by many other indications."
"Once again, we see that the governments are playing a double game and establishing - by indirect methods - a system that the people would not accept if they were consulted in full knowledge of the facts."
"Madam President, I wish to make a personal statement."
"I voted against Mr Rothley's proposal because I am sorry we did not accept the Council document, which meant that we missed a major opportunity finally to obtain a statute at the end of this legislative term."
"You all know how difficult it will be to make progress on a statute during the new term."
"It will be wellnigh impossible."
"I fear that Parliament's action has merely relegated the Statute to a kind of shunting yard."
"I thought it was right for us finally to get some movement into the Statute, and the words 'equal pay for all' apply just as much to the Council; its members also do the same work but have different salaries."
"There are hundreds of journalists who do the same work for different pay."
"I regarded the compromise as viable even if - which is not, of course, a good thing - it would have meant that Swedish, Danish and British Members were taxed under their national rules."
"But I got the impression that was not the issue at all; rather it was to go on relegating the Statute for Members to the shunting yard."
"I very much regretted that."
"That is why I voted against Mr Rothley's proposal and would have liked to vote for the Council proposal."
"Madam President, like Mrs Breyer, I would like to say this is a missed opportunity."
"Although many people have expressed their disgust, I do not know how we are going to go back to the electorate and justify that basically things are remaining the same."
"The Liberal and Green amendment was deliberately sabotaged by people who do not want to see the system changed."
"Although I would have had major problems with the idea of an EU tax system - it is not something I could support - or that our salaries would be increased, we need to deal with the way in which expenses are dished out in this Parliament."
"What is wrong with having a system whereby you have to account for what you spend?"
"We now have to go out in June to look for votes from the electorate."
"The one thing that everybody is focused on is how the repayment system works in this Parliament."
"We have to look for change."
"Today was a prime opportunity."
"We missed that because of political manoeuvring within Parliament."
"It is going to very difficult for us to justify our position."
"That is why I voted against the Rothley report."
"I would have had major problems with a salary increase or with the idea of an EU-wide tax system."
"That is the thin edge of the wedge."
"I do not agree with a harmonised tax system or with - as Mr Berthu said - many of the harmonisations that are going on within the EU."
"I voted against Prodi basically because he is a complete federalist and also in favour of the militarising of the EU which I do not approve of."
"That is why I had to vote against him."
"Madam President, I do not normally give explanations of vote but on this occasion I shall, because this may have been one of the last actions in this present Parliament, and I want to avoid any possible misunderstanding about what is perhaps an ambiguous vote."
"I did vote against the Rothley report because I take the view that, with all its faults, we should have accepted the proposed Statute for Members that came from the Council."
"I take that view with some regret because Mr Rothley is a very distinguished Member of this Parliament who has contributed a great deal to its work."
"In general I am always very sympathetic to the idea that Parliament should defend its rights and its position vis-à-vis other institutions."
"But on this occasion, particularly in view of the coming election, I took the view that it was better for us to get this matter behind us."
"I have always taken the view that Parliament must rigorously and ruthlessly defend its constitutional and legal rights."
"When, however, it is a question of its own personal rights, the rights of its Members - particularly the financial rights of its Members - Parliament would be well advised to tread more softly."
"There is a difference between the two."
"If I had to be asked what Parliament needs, I do not think it is more formal powers, I think it is to come closer to the minds, hearts and spirits of the electorate."
"I am afraid the postponement of the Statute may stand in the way of that."
"I know that you, Madam President, have a different view."
"I am sorry, on this last occasion, to have to differ."
"I have always had great respect, both political and personal, for you."
"But unlike many who voted against the Rothley report I did so because I believe the European Parliament should be more powerful, more influential, should play a larger role in the European Union."
"It was my view that by voting against the Rothley report I could serve that political goal."
"Madam President, as far as procedure is concerned, I would like to inform Mr Cox and Mrs Green - although they have left - that on 3 December, I had tabled an amendment similar to the global amendments, which have been the subject of long debate, and that that amendment had been declared inadmissible at the time, perhaps because I had tabled it."
"On a personal note, regarding the Rothley report, I would like to say that the truth has been revealed."
"The majority of Members of this House - 376 Members - have shown that in actual fact they did not want the system for reimbursing travel expenses to be changed. That is what is at issue here."
"The resolution adopted on 3 December stated that thanks to the Treaty of Amsterdam, for the first time in its history the European Parliament was in a position to adopt itself a single statute for Members, and that this statute should enter into force as soon as the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam provided a legal basis for its adoption. This gave the impression that we were prepared to adopt a statute."
"However, given the rejection today of our Amendment No 18, which stated that we would do our utmost to ensure that this statute entered into force at the beginning of the next parliamentary term, Parliament is showing its true colours, and on the very day and in the very week when a new system for the reimbursement of travel expenses is being adopted, a system which is supposedly based on expenses actually incurred but is actually somewhat similar to a lump-sum system."
"That is why we voted against the Rothley report."
"Parliament does not want to be open and transparent about the way in which its Members are paid, and that is particularly scandalous in terms of public opinion."
"The current system of reimbursement is absurd, particularly with regard to travel expenses."
"We need to bring about a change and find a solution in order to deal with the absurdity of the situation, but also because there are other important issues, besides the salaries of its own Members, which the European Parliament ought to be concentrating on."
"We support the compromise which the Council reached in April."
"We should like to have a uniform statute giving all Members the same salary, but with the possibility of taxation at national level."
"The Danish Social Democrats support the Council's amended draft Statute for Members, because the European Parliament needs to put its own house in order before the elections."
"It is not possible to wait and negotiate with the Council."
"We have endorsed a proposed compromise which brings us slightly nearer to our objective, in the hope of at least avoiding the whole matter being rejected outright."
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party has pushed for reform of all the EU's institutions."
"We have pressed for more transparency in the Council."
"We have been at the forefront of the work to ensure openness and better management in the Commission and we now come to put our own house - Parliament - in order."
"The EPLP has consistently campaigned for a coherent and transparent system in which MEPs could operate."
"We have voted this morning to try to ensure that concrete measures are put in place as quickly as possible."
"We have been at the forefront of reform and believe that we have to reach a conclusion on this matter and start the new mandate with a statute in place."
"We have pressed for a transparent system of payments for travel expenses, an equal salary for MEPs from all countries, and a proper method of direct payments for staff."
"The Council has said that it will look at the detail of implementation of the Statute alongside Parliament and we look forward to playing an active role in those further negotiations over the new few weeks."
"I abstained from all the votes because I will be leaving the European Parliament and do not wish to decide on the Statute for future Members."
"The Portuguese Socialist Members voted against the motion for a resolution approved today in the European Parliament because this motion prevents the entry into force of the Statute for Members proposed by the Council of Ministers which represents an important reinforcement of Parliament's credibility."
"The continuation of the current set of rules postpones a long-standing desire of the European Parliament to finally achieve the principle of equality between all Members."
"The new Statute was characterised by strictness and transparency in the rights and duties of all the Members and would have done away, once and for all, with the vagaries and speculation which are the preferred recourse of all those who thereby aim to undermine the value of political action."
"The European Parliament has missed an unparalleled opportunity to resolve an issue which is fundamental to its good image and dignity, especially at a time when transparency and efficiency in the workings of all the Community institutions are being discussed and demanded in Europe."
"The outcome of today's vote, which saw a majority of our House give its support to the Rothley report, is a defeat as far as we are concerned."
"This majority, which invoked all sorts of legal arguments, was concerned first and foremost with maintaining our salaries and privileges at all costs."
"For a long time, a majority in this Parliament has been hiding behind the lack of initiative from the Council in this matter in order to excuse its unwillingness to conclude a statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"After several years of work, a proposal had been drawn up that was, in general, satisfactory, and the Council had indicated that it was willing to negotiate with Parliament, following the result of today's vote, with a view to finding a compromise."
"The response of the majority in this House today does not match up to its commitments to its own voters or to the expectations of public opinion."
"Following the Commission's resignation and the problems of fraud and poor financial management, how can the majority in this Parliament justify the fact that our House is incapable of reforming anything that affects our allowances and the financial management of our institution?"
"My group is going to continue fighting the battle we began a long time ago."
"But each of our colleagues who voted in favour of the Rothley report will have to shoulder their responsibilities in terms of public opinion and the postponement of the uniform Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"The vicissitudes surrounding the establishment of a statute for Members of the European Parliament have been many and complex."
"As the only Swedish member of the committee, I was closely involved, over a six-month period, in following and contributing to the discussions, in particular through the tabling of an amendment reflecting the Greens' viewpoint. This expressed our opposition to the detachment of MEPs from their own voters and Member States by such things as the introduction of EU salaries, EU taxes, EU pensions and so on."
"I do not think, therefore, that it is desirable to have a statute which regulates these matters."
"However, we need to tackle the excessively generous allowances, for example those covering travel and office expenses, and to introduce a system whereby only the costs actually incurred are reimbursed."
"Under the Rules of Procedure, this can be done at any time and without the introduction of a statute."
"It is therefore unacceptable that Parliament has hitherto done nothing about it, since it would have been a simple matter - had the will existed."
"In view of these considerations, I voted against the report."
"We are absolutely convinced that Members of the European Parliament are elected by the people of the Member States to represent the voters' interest in the EU."
"The remuneration and taxation of MEPs is therefore a national affair."
"We are consequently opposed to a uniform European statute on Members' remuneration."
"We advocate that the current remuneration and reimbursement system should be discontinued, since it means that Members of this Parliament are paid large sums in expenses which have not been incurred."
"It is therefore necessary to establish a new system of remuneration and reimbursement, whereby the reimbursement of expenses must be accompanied by a bill, and payment is dependent on the Member signing a declaration that the expenses have actually been incurred in connection with the exercise of their mandate."
"On 26 April 1999, the Council drew up a draft Statute based on the European Parliament's text."
"In this draft, the Council sets out a series of proposals regarding the Statute, stating amongst other things that the payment of reimbursements will be based on vouchers, and proposals are also made regarding the establishment of conditions of employment for assistants."
"We believe that the Council's text is a distinct improvement on the European Parliament's draft Statute, which was adopted on 3 December 1998."
"We shall therefore support those parts of the draft which tighten up the current arrangements for reimbursement and lay down proper conditions of employment for assistants."
"We wish to emphasise, however, that Members' salaries must be taxed at national level, and the revenues must therefore go to the Member States."
"We are opposed to an EU tax system, and we therefore cannot support the Council's 'should' clause in Article 8(6), which states that the revenues should be paid back into the EU's budget."
"We believe that the adoption of the Statute is yet another step towards a United States of Europe, with the European Parliament as a co-legislator."
"Mr Rothley's draft report shows this quite plainly, and it is a clear example of how far removed the European Parliament has become from the interests of the people."
"The only reason why we can support parts of the draft for the new Statute is that we believe that it is a vital step towards remedying the European Parliament's long-standing squandering of our taxpayers' money."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam provides for a statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"Article 190(5) of the Treaty establishing the European Community gives Parliament the power to 'lay down' this statute."
"Some of our Spanish, Portuguese and other colleagues are in favour of this, not only for ideological reasons, but also perhaps for the sake of convenience."
"In fact, on the basis of national statutes, there was discrimination between the German Members, whose thriving economy allowed them to receive substantial allowances, and our Portuguese colleagues, whose moderate economy meant that they only received moderate allowances."
"The Members of the National Front in the European Parliament are opposed to this European Statute for legal reasons which serve to nullify it."
"Members of the Parliament in Strasbourg are, in fact, the representatives of 15 different nations; they are not the elected representatives of a European nation."
"They represent the 15 national sovereignties and not a European sovereignty."
"Furthermore, the European Parliament's legal basis originates in an international treaty and not in an internal legislative text."
"It is an intergovernmental institution and organisation, not an institution that is based on a constitution."
"Our legal status is therefore international rather than constitutional."
"That is why the Statute for Members is a political strike against the legal texts on which Parliament is based."
"It is the first element of a European federal constitution and it is being introduced in a surreptitious and clandestine manner."
"And that is the last straw as far as a parliament is concerned."
"A parliament represents the people. Yet here the European Parliament is progressively imposing on them a federal constitution within its powers while the people's backs are turned."
"This is all the more serious since if national Members were paid out of the European budget from now on and paid taxes into that budget, they would no longer have any financial or fiscal links with their people."
"How then would the Members of the European Parliament be able to represent their country of origin when their links with it are being gradually weakened?"
"Today we have the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, we already have the European currency, and tomorrow it will be the European state."
"We voted in favour of the amendment by the Liberal Group with regard to Parliament's system of pay and expenses, as it was the only way to bring into effect a reform that has taken a long time to prepare, and one that many had called for."
"We do not believe the matter can be postponed any longer, but feel that this vital reform should be introduced before the start of the new Parliament."
"We believe that the central issues of the reform are the standardisation of pay for Members, national taxation and bona fide travel expenses."
"From the very beginning I have asked for a special travel card to be introduced, like the one used in the Swedish Parliament."
"As parliamentarians, we should be reimbursed the travel costs actually incurred."
"We need to establish a statute for Members of the European Parliament in order to change the unsatisfactory system which exists at present."
"A basic requirement, which the Swedish Government has also pressed for in the Council, is that national tax should be deducted instead of EU tax."
"I share that view."
"I have stated on many occasions that, in my opinion, our salaries should be the same as those of Swedish Members of Parliament."
"We now need to come up with a proposal without delay."
"The Conservative and Socialist groups in Parliament, through their action today, have jeopardised the credibility of the European Parliament by rejecting the proposal for a Members' statute put forward by the Liberal Group."
"Legal chicanery and trickery have played a significant part in this."
"Had the Liberal Group's proposal been approved, we should have been able to go to the polls with our flag flying high and showing that we had not only cleaned up the European Commission, but inside our own house as well."
"The Liberal Group's proposal was a realistic one, and would have made it possible to reach an agreement with the Council of Ministers before Parliament rose for the elections."
"The political groups which backed the rejection of the proposals from both the Liberal Group and the Council of Ministers are responsible for the fact that we have got nowhere with reform."
"Instead, we are left with a dubious proposal on travel expenses."
"In the course of our work, the Liberals have consistently pressed for an accelerated timetable of reforms."
"The fact that some groups, so close to the finishing post, have been intransigent and in no hurry for reform, also leaves one feeling bitter."
"The draft Statute contains many worthwhile points: a uniform salary, but with the possibility of imposing national tax in those countries which wish to do so; clear rules governing the declaration of Members' interests; and transparency in expenses and travel allowances, on the basis of actual costs."
"The European Parliament would also have been able to reinforce its legitimacy by not having the sole right of approval of its own salaries, like other parliaments."
"I abstained from voting on the Rothley report because I feel that this is not the time to approve this statute, as so many wanted."
"The lists of candidates are now ready and the rules would have been changed without the potential new Members being able to participate in the vote."
"However, I consider that it will be imperative to approve the Statute for Members of the European Parliament as soon as possible after Parliament reopens in July."
"Madam President, naturally we fought for the Kuhn report."
"We would have liked to see the guarantee extended for up to five years; that would have meant that the principle of sustainability was finally also introduced de facto ."
"It would have meant that producers would have tried to produce long-life products."
"What I very much regret about the compromise is the fact that when the directives are implemented it will now be possible for the Member States to introduce a two-month complaint period."
"And I will be calling on the German Government not to make use of this; indeed it has already announced that."
"It would be a bitter setback for consumer protection."
"For how can it be that someone from France, for instance, goes shopping in Germany, relies on a two-year guarantee but then finds that because he bought the goods in Germany he should have lodged a complaint within two months?"
"I do not believe that is what we were aiming at with this report."
"Indeed Mrs Kuhn is just as sorry about this provision."
"Yet the report is a small step in the right direction."
"I only hope that many Member States will not make use of the possibility that has now been established of a two-month complaint period. If they do not, the report will be a step in the right direction because it will mean that consumers can have the guarantee extended to two years."
"I believe it is very positive that we have also managed for the first time to establish a one-year guarantee for second-hand goods; that is a step towards greater sustainability and greater consumer protection."
"However, I hope that also means that we do not apply this two-month complaint period, because in the case of many goods defects are only found after two months have elapsed."
"Then consumers would get little out of this two-year guarantee."
"So I can only appeal for this not to be applied."
"I do not support the common position on this directive."
"I believe that a directive on the subject can be justified if it brings real benefits to consumers who buy goods across borders - but this directive does not do so."
"I believe that the directive fails to deal satisfactorily with the situation where a consumer buys goods in one country, then goes home and finds that they are defective."
"In that situation he or she still has to return them to the place where the original purchase took place in order to obtain a refund, repair etc."
"It would have been far better - and have brought real benefits to consumers - if the consumer had the right to negotiate such compensation/repair etc with a representative of the company - where one exists - in his country of residence."
"As it is, the directive deals with this problem only through the hope, expressed in preamble 13, that producers of consumer goods marketed in several Member States will attach contact addresses in those states; there is also the prospect of future revision of the directive held out in preamble 20."
"The directive may well therefore raise hopes of cross-border consumer rights that it does not fulfil."
"Another problem with the directive is the way that it deals with second-hand goods."
"Article 1, paragraph 3, allows Member States to exempt second-hand goods sold at auction where consumers have the opportunity of attending the sale in person."
"But preamble paragraph 16 is very confusing: it says that the nature of second-hand goods makes it generally impossible to replace them, so that the consumer's right of replacement is generally not available for these goods."
"It goes on to say that for such goods Member States 'may enable the parties to agree to a shortened period of liability', that is shorter than 2 years."
"I take this to mean that second-hand goods, except those sold at auction, are covered by the directive, and that some form of consumer guarantee will have to apply to them although Member States may make it last for less than 2 years."
"I wonder whether the Council has appreciated the impact of this on the second-hand market?"
"What haggles will now take place over the 'shortened period of liability'?"
"Will this kind of haggle add a new dimension to car boot sales (which are not auctions) with lawyers setting up their tables at such sales in order to resolve disputes?"
"If the consumer's right to repair etc is not 'generally available' in relation to second-hand goods, will each Member State specify where it is available?"
"If so, we will see 15 different systems springing up."
"I await these developments with interest, but cannot give the directive my support as it stands and have therefore abstained in the final vote approving the text."
"Madam President, the World Trade Organisation has set 13 May as the deadline for Europeans to lift the embargo they have imposed on imports of American meat that has been treated with hormones, and particularly BST."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations urges the European leaders to maintain this embargo on BST. This hormone is produced from genetically modified bacteria; it certainly has a damaging effect on the health of cattle and very probably also on the health of humans who consume the meat."
"We must apply the precautionary principle here, just as we should apply it to all the genetically modified organisms whose import into Europe has unwisely been authorised by the Commission."
"But we must go even further. We must determine where the responsibilities lie in the present context and put forward proposals to correct the situation."
"It is important to note that the rules of international trade that are applied by the WTO and that prevent us from making proper use of the precautionary principle were ratified in the agreements concluded at the Uruguay Round by Europeans themselves; they were led astray by poor advisers, such as the European Commission, which undoubtedly was overly influenced by foreign interests."
"That must be corrected first and foremost by way of institutional reform and at the next international negotiations."
"But I was truly alarmed by the fact that during the debate on Monday evening, Commissioner Brittan did not show any sign of regret and indicated that he considers the laws of free trade to be almost like divine laws, superior to all."
"What is even more alarming is that the President-designate of the next Commission, Romano Prodi, stated yesterday morning in this Hemicycle that the next international negotiations should open, and I quote, 'a further round of liberalisation'."
"These people have not really understood anything."
"With them, we are heading towards a catastrophe."
"Instead, what we need to do now is to establish in international trade the free choice of the people and the primacy of national sovereignty, as expressed in a democratic manner."
"Madam President, of course we too are pleased that the EU has spoken out quite clearly in favour of maintaining the ban on hormone-treated meat."
"I personally find it most regrettable that the Commission commissioned this study so late."
"We have known for years that there is at least one hormone that is suspected of being carcinogenic and that the other hormones have particularly adverse effects on young people during puberty."
"We know, and that is the crucial point, that consumers do not want hormone-treated meat."
"Consumers want healthy, natural food."
"That is why this is a very positive decision, for it would have been a retrograde step to have simply introduced labelling, as we have sadly done in the case of novel foods even though the consumers have objected to genetically modified foods."
"The Commission is also planning to extend the moratorium on genetically manufactured bovine growth hormones."
"Here too it would be high time to issue a ban, as Canada has already done."
"All the studies conducted by the Scientific Committee show the dangerous and explosive effects of treating animals with hormones."
"There are many other indications to support these findings and we must also finally get away from the situation where the WTO only addresses the question of residues, for when they decide to buy goods, consumers also have the right to object to a certain kind of production."
"So it is most welcome that the Commission has taken this decision; however, we should have already indicated the health hazards much more clearly and plainly in the past."
"Madam President, let me first say how happy I am to be able to give an explanation of vote during your last part-session as president."
"I was most impressed by the strength of feeling Parliament has expressed towards you."
"What also pleases me is the fact that this House has demanded unanimously by 525 votes - which is indeed rare - for the ban on hormone-treated meat to be maintained."
"We in the Committee on Agriculture have succeeded in turning a proposal that tended towards giving preference to labelling into maintenance of the ban instead."
"Now the scientific findings have confirmed our fears."
"The outcome of the decision by 525 votes will impress the Council and make it now maintain this ban on hormone-treated meat and resume the discussions in the WTO panel, so as to make it clear that we are not in the mood to burden our people with this highly dangerous hormone-treated meat."
"Many thanks and I wish you all the best!"
"Thank you for those kind words, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf."
"In recent years we have noted that the succession of World Trade Organisation positions on matters involving trade in agricultural and food products has strangely coincided with the interests and pressure of the United States."
"In the cases of hormone-treated meat and the sale of seeds produced genetically - known as genetically modified organisms or GMOs - the European Union is not being allowed to respect the concerns of its consumers."
"Clearly this type of argument is sometimes used to conceal protectionist commercial practices."
"However, this is not the case with the European Union at this juncture given that BSE has severely shaken consumer confidence."
"This means that the European authorities are taking precautions to respect these concerns, which are more profound in Europe than in other parts of the world."
"Indications exist of the harmful effects on health of consuming hormone-treated meat, together with suspicions that some scientific results are being concealed from European decision-makers."
"The EU must therefore remain firm in its position that all scientific data must be provided."
"The insensitivity of the WTO in this respect confirms to us that the WTO rules on sanitary and phytosanitary protection (SPS Agreement) do not serve this purpose and must be amended at the next round of negotiations."
"In the case of bananas, the EU is not being permitted to grant a trade concession to small countries which used to be its colonies - the ACP countries - where bananas represent the mainstay of their economies."
"This is particularly serious as this EU policy is included in the spirit of the Lomé Agreements which date from 1963 and which therefore significantly predate the current Multilateral Trade Agreement resulting from the Marrakesh Agreement of 1994."
"What is this all about?"
"Is it because the US is a banana producer?"
"Of course not."
"It is simply because the US wants to defend its companies which have a monopoly over the banana trade with their dollar bananas and which are in competition with the ACP countries."
"Furthermore, if the WTO were to force the EU into completely liberalising the banana trade, there is absolutely no doubt that sooner or later the support system for Community banana producers would come to an end."
"I would call on the Commission to remain firm in defence of our interests and not to be afraid to stand up to international pressures. It must take due note of all these cases in order to take the necessary precautions in the next round of WTO negotiations."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we got the EU Commission's first scientific findings on hormone-treated meat in the USA 'just in time'."
"Now we have it in black and white."
"The hormones used on bovine animals are extremely harmful to man, especially to children."
"There is open talk of carcinogenic effects, of premature puberty, of immunological damage."
"Our only answer to that must be to maintain the ban on hormone-treated meat from the USA."
"Any further speculation about labelling, about compensation payments, any ideas about coming to an arrangement with the WTO rules, are simply obsolete."
"That is also the answer I expected from Sir Leon Brittan."
"But I found that he did not utter a single plain word on the subject of hormones in his statement."
"And his view that this is primarily a legal and economic question rather than one of public health is quite outrageous and irresponsible."
"On the contrary, the legal situation is clear, as are the economic interests."
"And in the interest of public health we should really call on the US Government to introduce a ban on hormone-treated meat in the USA."
"After bananas, hormone-treated meat is the second source of major dispute between the USA and the EU."
"In the case of bananas too I emphatically ask for an end to the surrender to free-marketeering."
"We must not just give in on bananas simply so as not to annoy the US Administration."
"We cannot take yet another step back from our development policy principles."
"We must use the need to change our common organisation of the banana market in order to give special support to a means of production that is socially, ecologically and developmentally friendly - in every possible area."
"During the coming WTO round these reforms, including the reform of the GATT which is also implicated in the banana dispute, must come at the top of the agenda."
"But we must not just wait for the outcome of that round."
"Here and now we must continue the EU panel against the USA's extra-territorial legislation, against Section 301, and under no circumstances must we break it off."
"And we must take vigorous steps against the measures taken by the USA, which has de facto been imposing punitive tariffs since 3 March even though the panel's ruling did not come until much later."
"It is the Commission's task here not to protect free trade but to protect those who suffer in the name of free trade."
"We Greens hope that you will support the amendments to that effect that we tabled to the compromise resolution, so that we can vote for the compromise."
"Europe must be firm with the United States in the context of the transatlantic partnership."
"We must break away from the current thinking behind the liberalisation of trade, which does not give any consideration to social or environmental rules. We must also block the political, economic and monetary hegemony of the US, which is actually imposing the interests of American companies as if they are in the general interest."
"The issue of hormone-treated meat proves that health and consumer protection requirements are not being taken into account and that the precautionary principle holds little sway in the face of prevailing economic interests. Europe must continue to uphold its ban."
"Furthermore, the dispute over aircraft noise is evidence of their refusal to take account of our higher environmental standards."
"The social aspect is less evident in the trade disputes. Yet unfortunately, the dominant logic today of opening up the markets, where social and environmental rules are disregarded, is systematically damaging this social aspect."
"The banana issue reveals that the interests of multinational firms are a thousand times more important than the development of nations; the market is prevailing over the solidarity that needs to be developed within a political community."
"It is also evident that the US agricultural trusts are making enormous profits by growing bananas in Latin America, while the people in those countries are not seeing any improvement in their situation."
"The time has come to base the necessary international trade and liberalisation of the markets on new principles and a framework other than that decreed by the WTO, the GATT or the new transatlantic partnership."
"Madam President, I voted against the Spencer report on the common foreign and security policy."
"It is just further evidence of the tendency towards militarising the European Union."
"This report talks about supporting the Franco-British Declaration at St. Malo and also of the speedy integration of the Western European Union into the EU."
"It is quite clear the Western European Union is a military alliance."
"It believes in nuclear weapons and is committed to the nuclear deterrent."
"You would think that at the end of the 20th century we should be trying to get rid of these military blocs because they are not relevant, as far as I can see."
"We are breathing new life into the Western European Union, which should have actually been defunct last year."
"In my own country we have been reassured over and over again that the European Union is not being militarised, yet many reports which have gone through this Parliament in the five years I have been here clearly indicate that is the direction it is going in."
"I do not believe that any kind of militarising of the EU is in the interests of the people at large, either within Europe or within the world as a whole."
"We are only setting up a new military bloc, which I do not believe is a good idea."
"Governments throughout the EU should be honest with their electorate, especially in neutral countries like my own, and say: 'This is really what is going on here."
"Are you in favour of it or are you against it?' It is quite clear that if something is not done now, at this stage, we are going to have a defence aspect to the EU."
"Helmut Kohl said he believed that at the end of the line to European Union lay a European army and European police force."
"The public has not been told this."
"It should be."
"I am fundamentally opposed to any kind of European army or European police force or to a European defence identity within the EU."
"The CFSP, which was first launched by the Maastricht Treaty, has found it hard to make its mark."
"For too long, it was practically nonexistent and Europe has looked like a political dwarf in the international arena by adopting minimalist positions."
"Mr Spencer's reports show that the European Union is beginning to assert itself as a political power, and they clearly express the European Parliament's desire to contribute in this area."
"Although the European Union's political action is obviously still inadequate - and this is particularly evident in terms of security and defence - we must qualify this statement in light of the recent events in Kosovo."
"The European Union has shown that it can take initiatives, for example by organising the Rambouillet Conference."
"It can make its voice heard and is not playing a supporting role to the United States."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam will enable us to give fresh impetus to the CFSP."
"The appointment of a High Representative for the CFSP will render this policy more visible and more effective."
"I support the rapporteur's suggestion that we should organise a hearing within the Committee on Foreign Affairs before this High Representative takes up office."
"Moreover, the new instrument of common strategies allows us to provide the CFSP with fundamental guidelines."
"The General Affairs Council should adopt such a strategy with regard to the Russian Federation and submit it to the Cologne European Council."
"I am completely in favour of this timetable, and because this issue is so urgent, we must not postpone its adoption."
"The crisis the Russian Federation is currently experiencing, in institutional terms and also in economic and social terms, means that there can be no delays."
"The events in Kosovo should spur us on to establish intensive dialogue with the Russian Federation."
"It plays an essential role in the European defence structure, and this is a key element for stability in the continent of Europe."
"The European Parliament should be consulted on the content of this strategy."
"Since this is not provided for in the Treaty on European Union, I hope, like the rapporteur, that an interinstitutional agreement will be drawn up to provide for this consultation."
"I share his indignation as regards the assessment of Parliament's powers in this matter."
"The amendments introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam do not change anything in that respect: with the exception of the financing of the CFSP, Parliament's role is confined to information and consultation."
"The presidency failed to present in time to Parliament its annual report on the main aspects and basic choices of the CFSP."
"That is sufficient evidence that there is no desire to involve Parliament in this policy."
"The EU's common foreign and security policy has been wrecked: the United Kingdom and the USA have followed their own line more than once over Iraq, and the EU has been unable to resolve the conflicts in Bosnia, Kosovo and Turkey (over Kurdistan)."
"The EU should tone down its common foreign and security policy and instead concentrate all its energies on preventing conflict in the EU and the neighbouring regions."
"The CFSP should never have been established."
"It is misguided."
"The EU is not a state, and should not become one."
"This report contains many good intentions and for that reason it deserves our support."
"However, its purpose seems somewhat pathetic."
"The following symbolic passage is sufficient proof of this: 'The common strategy towards Russia is being considered against a political backdrop that has changed with NATO's military action against the Yugoslav Federation."
"There is also the question of the United States Congress's decision to develop under certain conditions an anti-missile defence system that, from the Russian point of view, challenges the ABM Treaty'."
"What does our rapporteur have to say in the face of these two harmful actions by the United States? As far as he is concerned, 'all these developments support the case for intensive dialogue between the European Union and the Russian Federation'."
"So on the American side, we have actions."
"And on the European side, we have words."
"There could be no clearer proof of Europe's powerlessness in the face of the American superpower."
"The United States benefited so much from the division of Europe after 1945 that it seems to be doing its utmost to create the conditions for a new division, this time between Western Europe on the one hand, and Orthodox Europe on the other."
"There have been countless hostile acts against the Orthodox civilisation in Europe - contempt, accusations of chauvinism, total ignorance of a different culture - and the bombing of Serbia is symptomatic of this attitude."
"The aim is to create a new division within Europe that we would not be able to deal with in any other way."
"The countries of Europe must reject this logic, with the mutual support and cooperation of the Russian Federation, in the interests of peace and prosperity for all."
"Mrs Müller has drawn up an excellent report on the budget estimates for 2000."
"We are happy to adopt many of its recommendations and therefore voted in favour of it."
"The rapporteur is right to go for a strict budgetary policy."
"It must only be possible to take on extra staff in specifically justified cases."
"The buildings must be paid off over the shortest possible period of time in order to keep interest payments to a minimum."
"The rapporteur also rejects direct subsidies out of the EU budget for setting up and operating a supermarket and the catering services in the Parliament buildings."
"These are all recommendations which we firmly support."
"I would, however, like to raise a number of questions."
"We support the move to a new personnel policy under which promotion would be performance based."
"This encourages motivation."
"But the big question here is who judges this performance?"
"Can we guarantee that the appraisal will be objective?"
"We must do away with favouritism and political appointments based on personal preference."
"The Santer Commission came to grief as a result of cronyism."
"Let this serve as an example to others."
"Finally, I should like to say a word about the salaries of Community officials."
"If a statute is accepted for Members of Parliament, there will be a huge discrepancy between the salary levels of MEPs and officials."
"Not that we as MEPs should be dissatisfied."
"But it does indicate that the salaries paid to officials are excessive."
"This is something we need to debate."
"The sitting was suspended at 1.48 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m."
"Agenda 2000 (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on Agenda 2000."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is and has been the wish of the Council, the Commission and Parliament to achieve three objectives by means of Agenda 2000."
"The first is to make the Union fit for enlargement eastwards."
"The second is to reform its own policies, especially its agricultural and Structural Funds policies, in a sense to bring a breath of fresh air into our policies. The third is to safeguard the financing of these policies over the next seven years."
"The master plan presented by the Commission to this end did not come through the more than two years of discussions in Parliament and the Council unchanged, and I admit that this was not advantageous in every respect."
"It will become apparent that we have not entirely achieved the objectives I have just listed."
"But it is also true that we have come very, very close to doing so."
"The result of Berlin is a compromise."
"That it came into being at all is also thanks to the German Presidency of the Council, and in particular to the German Chancellor."
"Every compromise, including of course the Berlin compromise, has some more and some less satisfactory aspects."
"Perhaps in the European Union maximum satisfaction can be achieved only if the dissatisfaction is equally distributed."
"Here too the German Presidency can boast some success."
"But so can Parliament!"
"Never before has the European Parliament been so closely involved in the decision-making on a reform project of this scale."
"From the time of the first reading of the reports in the European Parliament up to the Berlin European Council at the end of March, Parliament influenced and modified the results in the course of intensive discussions, and in intensive negotiations after Berlin."
"This result is certainly not quite what we had hoped and wanted."
"However, we are also aware that for the first time the European Parliament has managed to change important aspects of a European Council decision."
"We succeeded in ensuring the implementation and funding of a fourth URBAN Community initiative, so as to promote the economic and social regeneration of cities and urban neighbourhoods."
"I want to take this opportunity to particularly thank the Commissioner, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, for supporting the European Parliament's position on these questions, as also on a range of others."
"We would not have carried off this success without having her on our side."
"It will be thanks to us if more attention is paid in future to land-use planning, to remote regions and islands."
"It will be thanks to us that more support is to be given to education and training, and above all it is thanks to us that the flexibility instrument can be increased."
"Also to our credit is the review clause for the financing of future policies, especially in the external policy area and in relation to aid for the reconstruction of the afflicted Balkan regions."
"It is thanks to us that codecision has been introduced at least in some areas of agricultural policy."
"I think the future President of the Commission has us to thank that this Commission will have considerably more staff available for carrying out new tasks than the old Commission ever had."
"The large majority of my group will approve the interinstitutional agreement on medium-term financial planning and we will of course give our assent to those parts of Agenda 2000 that require such assent."
"As we declared back in November 1998: we, the Parliament, will do all we can to ensure that the Agenda 2000 package is adopted before Parliament is re-elected and we want to get this Agenda 2000 under way now."
"It makes a vital contribution to the Union's ability to act during a difficult period."
"With our decisions on Agenda 2000 we will make the European Union more able to move into the future."
"Mr President, in an era when the dogma that you can implement policies, especially social policies, without money is increasingly gaining ground, I continue to insist on the need for a substantive policy of economic and social cohesion within the framework of the European Union."
"Social and economic cohesion is one of the fundamental principles of the Treaty on European Union and I think that all the institutions of the European Union must remain firmly committed to this fundamental principle."
"I have to say that, within this framework, the Commission proposals on Agenda 2000 were a step in the right direction. I would like, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, to congratulate Mrs Wulf-Mathies, Mr Fischler and Mr Flynn on their position throughout the negotiations."
"As we all know, the European Parliament formalised its proposals as far back as November, and I believe that it went much further than the Commission proposals."
"What it set out to do was to bring together two objectives: on the one hand to have effective fund management and, on the other, to place the emphasis where it was needed."
"This is why we asked from the outset that three quarters of the funds went to Objective 1 regions, which are the poorest."
"Taking this a step further, Mr President, negotiations took place and then we had the European Council meeting in Berlin, until which time there had been a certain indecisiveness."
"Fortunately, however, the European Council in Berlin reached a compromise, which was followed by negotiations between Parliament, the Council and, of course, the Commission."
"This brought about three constructive changes: the first change concerned the Community initiative, URBAN; the second was the European Regional Development Fund relating to actions for culture and tourism, and the third concerned the special emphasis given, again under the European Regional Development Fund, to islands."
"As with all compromises, the compromise reached at Berlin does not give cause for celebration, even less so for my country - and I must speak as a Greek - since the Greek Government accepted reforms which place us in the same category as Spain, Ireland and Portugal, countries which are less poor than ours and which are already participating in the euro."
"Nevertheless, if Parliament were to reject this compromise, all our efforts would go up in smoke, and it would prevent the timely onset of programmes within the third Community support framework on 1 January 2000."
"I move therefore that the regulation be adopted, especially now that most of the opinions expressed by Parliament as far back as November have been accepted, and that we achieved positive changes during the negotiations we had with the Council last month."
"I would also like to say a few words about the pre-accession funds."
"It is sad that Cyprus has been excluded by the Council."
"Cyprus is the only applicant country that has been excluded from pre-accession funding."
"I hope that Mr van den Broek will fulfil his commitment to examine the possibility of a special budget line to fund Cyprus, as we cannot have double standards."
"Such exclusions give rise to doubts as to whether there is indeed the will to admit Cyprus into the European Union, and these doubts must be dispelled as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, when the European Council in Berlin reached an agreement, the most important thing was that there was a political agreement."
"At that time it was unacceptable for Parliament."
"But at this historic moment we will hopefully agree to an interinstitutional agreement."
"It is historic in that never before has the European Council position been changed by Parliament and it reflects our new position."
"We see in front of us three of the resigning Commissioners, and I should like to say on this point that the original proposals on Agenda 2000 showed courage and vision on the part of the Commission."
"The results of the European Council were not satisfactory."
"We have achieved major results."
"Above all, for the first time we now have new rights in terms of non-compulsory expenditure on agriculture."
"That must surely be something positive for Commissioner Fischler."
"We have received new guarantees of new flexibility."
"We are not very satisfied by the fact that the Council has cut down enormously in an area where this Parliament has major rights - Category 3."
"At least we have achieved within the current constraints the possibility of a further adjustment by Parliament."
"In Category 4 - external policy - there is an agreement that we will have the possibility of review."
"The hypocrisy of the European Council can best be demonstrated by the fact that no less than EUR 250 m had to be decided within two weeks on Kosovo, thereby taking more than three-fifths of the overall basis for seven years."
"It shows therefore that Berlin is already outdated."
"But voting against an interinstitutional agreement at this moment would be a major mistake."
"It is on that basis that the Liberal Group will vote for the interinstitutional agreement because it will achieve not simply more money but more rights and more parity."
"It is on that basis that the European Community can move forwards."
"If we vote against it, with all the other difficulties, we would throw the European Union into a major phase of uncertainty at the time that the challenges for the new century are about to come."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, all the islanders of the European Union were pleased to see on the evening of 2 October 1997 that the Treaty of Amsterdam signed by the 15 Member States contained the first explicit references officially recognising the permanent and structural handicaps suffered by the island regions and the need to remedy this situation."
"Unfortunately, less than two years later and with the Treaty having entered into force last Saturday, it is important to note that the reform of the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period does not follow the same logic as the new Treaty."
"Although a solid legal basis allowed us to implement a truly integrated policy to help the island regions, particularly by means of the Structural Funds, the Council and the Commission decided otherwise, paying no heed to the European Parliament's recommendations in this matter."
"The island regions saw all the possibilities of special, specific treatment being categorically and methodically rejected."
"Even the modest request for a special section for cooperation with and between the islands in the Interreg III programme was rejected."
"On reading the regulations that will be adopted tomorrow, it would seem that the cause of the island regions will not have made any significant advances with this reform of the Structural Funds."
"Moreover, it is worrying to note that, from the year 2000, very few islands will be considered to be in need of support as a result of their slow development."
"Does this mean that the Council and the Commission believe that the Union's island regions have experienced enough economic development to call into question the political will - set out a year and a half earlier at the Amsterdam Council - to give real consideration to the islands' problems?"
"Does this mean that the permanent and structural handicaps that were expressly recognised have disappeared as if by magic in only 18 months?"
"Only the regulation concerning the ERDF refers to the need to help certain islands, and even then it only contains a very vague reference."
"Nevertheless, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Varela, and the members of the Committee on Regional Policy for their understanding and their support throughout this parliamentary term."
"Faced with such an inadequate outcome for the cause of the islands, there is no doubt that all efforts must now be made to ensure that the specific characteristics of the Union's island regions are considered not only in theoretical terms, but also in practical terms."
"But I trust that the European Parliament will continue along the path it has followed for several years."
"The Council and the Commission will not be able to pretend for ever that they do not hear us."
"Mr President, the framework for the financial perspective agreed in Berlin is not likely to raise much enthusiasm."
"This is probably not due so much to the amounts earmarked for or requested from each of our countries, but more to the generally restrictive solution adopted and its precariousness."
"Nevertheless, all the countries and governments declared that they were winners after the summit."
"But we should be objective."
"With such a financial framework, there will be no enlargement until 2006. In order to achieve this before then, the perspective will have to be extensively reweighted, as well as the respective amounts."
"This medium-term financial framework does not respond to such important issues as the consolidation of the euro and, in particular, any asymmetric shocks or other shocks which may result from the next WTO negotiations."
"In this context, although we are happy to unconditionally support and encourage the new interinstitutional agreement as a matter of principle and in order to guarantee stability and allow planning, the resulting compromise of the financial framework adopted with these characteristics gives us cause for concern."
"This will increase even more due to the absence of an in-depth reform of the CAP, which we recommend, and due to the undeniably restrictive content of the rules which will govern some of the cohesion-related instruments."
"However, other members of my group will talk about these aspects."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me turn to the positive aspects."
"It is vitally important to economic and social cohesion and therefore to the very core of the European social model that the new regulation was adopted in good time, before the end of the European Parliament's electoral term."
"That guarantees the continuation of the funding."
"However, the price is very high."
"The regions will now have to compensate for the financial cuts at the very heart of European integration by putting forward more intelligent plans."
"In this regard I call on the Commission to apply its control function really seriously and genuinely to pursue in its programmes the objectives formulated in the new regulation - sustainable development, promotion of employment, promotion of equal opportunities for women and men, environmental improvement, support for small and medium-sized undertakings - and not to shy away from them again in face of the Member States."
"The result of Berlin, as has already been said today, is not quite the reform we hoped for."
"After Parliament increased the rights of the people of Europe by incorporating a comprehensive principle of participation in the draft regulation - and this is the only basis for sustainable planning - the Council is now leaving this common concern to the discretion of the Member States."
"I regard that as the main problem with the new regulation."
"When the funds are used for integrated development plans, the traditional way of thinking in terms of resources must be overcome."
"The regulation does offer possibilities, but I have since become aware of the resistance at Member State level."
"What this means is that local development initiatives must obtain ESF and ERDF funds if they really are to be able to combat unemployment."
"Under the new Structural Funds regulation it has proved possible to continue the cohesion policy."
"But that is not a reform!"
"Efficiency, administrative simplification and concentration have fallen by the wayside."
"They were sacrificed to the confessional procedure and the favours handed out there."
"I conclude from this that if we do not finally manage to place the European interest above national interests we will not manage to achieve a genuinely progressive economic and social cohesion policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a consensus within Parliament as regards the enlargement of the EU to include the CEECs and the need to reform the CAP, and I would like to look at this aspect of Agenda 2000."
"Parliament, which represents the people of Europe, stated that it was in favour of the European agricultural model, greater equity, balanced rural development, improved quality and the protection of the environment. This was highlighted in the Cunha report."
"This political position is clear and it totally opposes the ever-increasing standardisation, the ever-increasing homogenisation, and the ever-increasing relentless competition, which pushes farmers' prices and incomes down. This is the ultra-liberal position of the Cairns Group and the United States."
"Thanks to Parliament's firm stance, which has meant that the Commission has had to take up a less intransigent position, and thanks to the perseverance and persistence of certain Member States, we have a satisfactory compromise for the short-term in terms of abandoning cofinancing, in terms of a more moderate fall than expected in guaranteed agricultural prices and in terms of the status quo on quotas."
"But what will happen in the future?"
"Does the reform enable us to respond to the Commission's plans for sustainable agriculture, which contradict its amended proposal on the agricultural section of Agenda 2000?"
"Is cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries enhanced?"
"Has rural development, which involves 80 % of the Union's territory, been given the role it deserves?"
"Is it promoted in the island regions and allocated greater resources in the budget?"
"Are the issues of the obvious social and environmental imbalances in the CAP and the division of agriculture into two categories truly resolved?"
"Is aid to agriculture better distributed and does it better protect the environment?"
"No, no, no and no."
"By moving away from the policy of supporting agriculture through prices, by shrinking into ourselves and encouraging nationalisation, by undermining this sector through a further increase in direct income aid, Europe is moving further and further away from its mission and the founding principles of the common agricultural market."
"What is even more serious is that it is eroding the foundations of its culture, its countryside, its gastronomy, and therefore a major part of its identity."
"How will the agricultural Europe, reformed in this way, be able to defend its political project for agriculture and rural development in the future WTO negotiations?"
"This gives rise to great concern."
"Those negotiating on behalf of Europe in the WTO will have to prepare for battle and put our minds at rest: the European Union must never have a political agricultural objective of bringing the Community's regulations into line with the rules of play of the global market."
"For the time being, since it is the present we must deal with, my group will vote in favour of the current compromise, but it urges the Commission to defend the European agricultural model at the next WTO negotiations."
"Mr President, it is on the strength of our convictions rather than any desire to put up opposition that we will not vote for the legislative resolutions on Agenda 2000, with the exception of the resolution on the COM in wine, as we do not support the positions of the Commission and the Council that emerged as a result of the Berlin compromise."
"How could we be pleased with an agreement that leads to a significant reduction in European farmers' incomes, through a partially compensated reduction in prices, before totally eliminating them to satisfy the requirements of the WTO?"
"You will be aware, Mr President, that certain agricultural products are essential for the environmental balance and for the utilisation of EU territory."
"Unfortunately, a serious decline will be experienced as far as certain products are concerned."
"I am thinking, in particular, of oil protein crops, which, I would remind you, are ideal rotation crops to produce quality cereals, something we are increasingly trying to do."
"When I drafted the two opinions of the Committee on Agriculture on Agenda 2000, I warned all my colleagues about the budget difficulties we would encounter."
"In this connection, I am for the most part satisfied with the Berlin agreement with respect to its aim to support, if need be, the agricultural guideline as and when the successive enlargements take place, taking into consideration an automatic annual technical adjustment in the financial perspective to account for inflation."
"We only hope that the principle of compulsory expenditure will not be called into question."
"Apart from its repercussions on farmers' incomes, this agreement in no way prepares for the next WTO negotiations, or perhaps, without saying so, it prepares for them too well."
"All the proposed reforms will be given a pounding."
"The only acquis that our partners will accept is the reduction of prices."
"Clearly, our partners are also going to try to dismantle compensation aid."
"We all know that the motto in these types of negotiations is that everything that has been established has been established while the rest is up for negotiation."
"European agriculture must not disappear."
"Besides the economic and financial role that farmers play, they also have a social, cultural and environmental role that must be given top priority."
"On listening to Mr Prodi's speeches, I noticed that he plans to use his position to enhance the role of the European Union in urban areas."
"So allow me to ask one question: in this context, where does the future of the countryside lie with the development of the Structural Funds to benefit urban areas, with the new WTO negotiations and with a CAP that contradicts our European identity?"
"That concludes the political group spokemen's contribution."
"We now come to the contributions of the rapporteurs."
"Mr President, above all we need to be aware here today of our responsibilities in Parliament's final part-session, not only our legislative function but our commitment to deliver this new round of European funds for our regions and local communities in a timely manner."
"As rapporteur I would like to tell you why I am recommending that Parliament gives a resounding 'Yes' vote to the Council regulation on structural funds as amended."
"Our objective has been to emphasise Parliament's priorities in the reform process through a succession of informal contacts."
"This informal procedure is an ongoing exchange of information, a fruitful dialogue which has resulted in Parliament's priorities being incorporated into the final Berlin text while some demands remain to be negotiated in post-Berlin meetings."
"We can be satisfied that key priorities have been met."
"Parliament requested that concentration must ensure that Objective 1 regions, the poorest in the Union, continue to receive priority assistance."
"This is the case in areas such as my own in Merseyside with a GDP of less than 75 % of the EU average which will continue to receive priority funds."
"I have to say that even if some financial special cases were made alongside Objective 1, this was of course the price to pay for a package and financial deal."
"We have to have the realism and pragmatism in this Parliament to recognise that consensus and compromise are the lifeblood of European politics."
"New Objective 2 regions will continue to benefit from a sustained European commitment and sustained investment."
"Again, if I look to my own region of the North-West, it has benefited from European funding."
"There is still a lot to do and we are glad to see the flexibility of a six-year potential phasing-out programme rather than four years in the Commission's original proposal."
"I would like to invite the Commission at the end of our mandate to take up the offer from Manchester City Council to come and see how European funds are making a difference to local communities there."
"We supported a safety net proposal."
"This we believe was a success."
"In addition, Parliament very much welcomes the request, that was met, for the Union to play an active role in promoting lasting peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland."
"This was met with a special peace package."
"We would have liked to have gone further on partnership but we hope that Member States will have the vision to ensure wide and deeper partnership in the drafting of programmes and in the implementing of those programmes."
"Most importantly, for me personally, the jewel in the crown achieved as a result of informal post-Berlin negotiations in Strasbourg was that the Council agreed to the European Parliament's request to modify the Berlin Summit decision to add a new URBAN initiative with 0.35 % of funds added to the Community pot."
"I hope Mr Flynn does not think we are plundering Article 10 because we will be using those funds for social and employment initiatives as well."
"URBAN has been popular with the public in some of our most deprived neighbourhoods and I believe we can help those communities on the path to regeneration."
"The rapporteurs therefore recommend that we now see a balance of interest between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"I would warn any political group that is thinking of playing party politics with this vote that blocking these proposals would mean a newly elected Parliament would be unable to vote until autumn, and this would put at risk over 200 billion of resources and involve interminable delays to local communities and projects."
"But let us be clear about what we are voting for today."
"This is not just a 112-page document of Eurospeak and technical details, although you can find plenty of Eurojargon in it."
"It is a package of funding to launch our regions into the new millennium, seven years of support for our most marginalised communities and areas who need our European commitment and solidarity, for the young, the long-term unemployed and women returners: people who want to play an active role and part in economic regeneration in Europe."
"This is a European Union package for jobs, for regeneration."
"It is an employment and regeneration pact and it is a product of a consensus and compromise between the Member States."
"As I have said, we believe we have made very positive improvements with the addition of a fourth Community initiative, a new URBAN initiative, which Parliament supported and campaigned for."
"For all the above reasons I urge members today to use their vote to give a unanimous 'Yes' vote to this funding package."
"Let us give our EU citizens the visible sign that we are backing the solidarity and support needed for the jobs and regeneration programmes for the new millennium"
"Mr President, it gives me pleasure to present the recommendation and the report on the Cohesion Fund, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy."
"When I presented this report for a first reading last November I spoke about the need for social and economic cohesion to remain one of the central pillars of the Community."
"The Cohesion Fund has been one of the clearest examples of this solidarity and action and what it can achieve."
"In approving this report on that occasion this House endorsed that view of the Community."
"In recent months, and indeed up to the Berlin Summit, there have been a number of meetings with the Council on the future of the Cohesion Fund."
"I was adamant to negotiate the retention of the Cohesion Fund and that it be maintained in its current form."
"The final agreement at Berlin upheld Parliament's views in relation to the Fund and points raised during the informal conciliation period were taken on board."
"Parliament's priorities in relation to the Cohesion Fund were easily identifiable."
"The first priority was to ensure the continuation of the Fund and the Council was able to agree with Parliament's view that the basic objectives of the Cohesion Fund are as relevant today as they were in 1992."
"Therefore the eligibility criterion of 90 % of the Union average wealth had to remain unchanged, allowing Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece to continue to qualify for the fund."
"The view shared by Parliament and the Commission that the four current cohesion countries should continue to be eligible was agreed to by Council."
"The countries concerned need to continue the convergence process, and the continuation of the Fund is a vital ingredient in this process."
"The retention of the fund under the same conditions means that the infrastructure gap between the four cohesion countries and the rest of the Community can gradually be closed."
"It is vital that the current imbalance in this area be redressed so as to allow for a harmonised level of economic development across the EU."
"A second point on which Parliament's views were taken on board, relates to the amount of an advance for projects and Parliament believed that the 10 % on account proposed by the Commission was insufficient."
"It would have exerted too heavy a burden on less-favoured regions trying to get a project off the ground, and the 20 % agreed at Berlin, I believe, recognised this fact."
"A further issue which Parliament had deemed unsatisfactory was the application of the 'polluter pays' principle."
"While we naturally supported the idea, the Commission proposal remained unclear as to what was meant by 'a project's capacity to generate revenue'."
"Clear guidelines were needed as to the practical implementation of the principle."
"In this respect I welcome the Commission's declaration attached to the Berlin conclusions that the implementation would have to take account of national, social sensitivities."
"In terms of what Parliament set out to achieve for the Cohesion Fund from 2000 to 2006, the Berlin agreement is highly satisfactory."
"For this reason I believe there is no need for any further adjustments."
"I will just outline some of the main features of the Cohesion Fund as it will be under the amended regulation from the year 2000."
"There will be an overall amount of EUR 18 billion available to the four cohesion countries for the seven year period."
"The allocation of the total resources between the four countries was made on the basis of precise and objective criteria, principally population size and GNP per capita."
"Account was taken of the improvement and national prosperity attained over the previous period as well as of surface area."
"Other factors, such as deficiencies and transport infrastructure were also considered."
"And halfway through the funding period a review of progress will take place to see which countries will continue to qualify on the basis of continuing to meet the 90 % criterion."
"As I have already mentioned, the 'polluter pays' principle is included in the amended regulation and other environmental considerations also feature."
"In this way Parliament's view that infrastructure development must take serious account of environmental obligations is clearly evident."
"Colleagues, we all took a very close interest in the Berlin Summit and are all well aware that the final agreement did not come easily."
"The question of the Cohesion Fund was frequently controversial and, against this background, Parliament can be satisfied that it was taken seriously by the other institutions and that our recommendations were taken on board."
"I welcome the final text of the regulation as one that reflects very clearly Parliament's views and I recommend that colleagues give this report their assent."
"This will consolidate many months of dedicated effort from Parliament's side to secure the best deal possible for the balanced development of our regions and the furthering of economic and social cohesion of the European Union."
"Parliament's assent will mean that the funding timetable can be adhered to in vital projects in Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal, enabling them to call down the necessary funding."
"These projects will make a real and tangible difference to the lives of millions of our citizens living in the Community's more remote and under-developed regions."
"But the Cohesion Fund is more than this."
"Its benefits are not limited to four Member States."
"In building the Union into a more cohesive, economic Union we are consolidating the single market and reinforcing the euro."
"We are allowing the Union to face up to not only these current projects but also the future ambition of enlargement."
"It is true that the Cohesion Fund is limited as to its sectors of operation, geographical focus and indeed amounts."
"However, it has proven to be an excellently focused instrument recording excellent expenditure levels and results which are of benefit to all."
"In conclusion, Mr President, on a personal note, I should like to sincerely thank Commissioner Wulf-Mathies for her very positive role in this area."
"She has always been most open at all times to discussion and debate, always understanding, always courteous to Parliament's members of the Committee on Regional Policy."
"Her commitment to the European Union and to her area of responsibility is an inspiration to us all."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur, I am very pleased for two reasons."
"Firstly, Parliament has the chance to approve tomorrow in the House our recommendation at second reading concerning the ERDF."
"This has important legal and political implications since, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the ERDF now comes under the codecision procedure."
"We have had the novel experience of negotiating with the Council and the Commission in order to find a consensus between Parliament's position, that of the 15 Member States and the Commission's proposal."
"One slip by Parliament, or simply one occasion where we do not exercise our powers responsibly, could result in us approving certain amendments that might prevent us from concluding this important regulation tomorrow, thereby preventing the regions of Europe from planning their activities for 1 January 2000."
"I am also very pleased as rapporteur because of the content of the document we have drawn up."
"It was not easy to fully explain our colleagues' ideas, but through four compromise amendments we succeeded in obtaining the agreement of the majority to withdraw other amendments, while also managing to preserve the spirit of our committee's proposal."
"The first of these four amendments refers to the inclusion of the concept of land-use planning in the ERDF, which is something Parliament has been fighting for for quite some time."
"We need to link regional development with spatial development. Or, if you prefer, we need to unite economic and social cohesion with the territorial cohesion of Europe."
"Our second compromise amendment is very closely related to land-use planning and calls on the ERDF to help establish the necessary links with regions suffering from permanent, geographical disadvantages because of their peripheral or insular status. The aim here is to promote exchanges between Europe's peripheral areas and the Community's central regions."
"In its three-yearly report on cohesion, the Commission has highlighted the fact that this situation is one of the main reasons for the backwardness of these regions and a factor in any eventual recovery."
"Our third compromise amendment specifically brings tourism and culture under the scope of the ERDF."
"Not long ago, just before he unfortunately passed away, the artist and humanist Yehudi Menuhin wondered publicly what would happen to the European Union's culture."
"Strangely, although 80 % of the Union's spending on culture comes from the Structural Funds, only 3 % of its appropriations are allocated to cultural projects."
"Our report hopes to provide a response to these questions and we would ask that culture be given a greater presence in the Structural Funds, including our cultural and natural heritage."
"Finally, in line with the report on the general regulation, we would ask that the URBAN initiative should be maintained alongside the Community's Interreg initiative."
"I would like to end by referring to a very special issue in which the European Parliament has played a very significant role: the structural aspects of fisheries."
"In my speech to the House at first reading, I called on the Commission to amend its proposal and put fisheries on an equal footing with agriculture."
"I am pleased to see today that our position - which was so strongly defended by our rapporteur, Mr Arias Cañete, under the firm and constant guidance of the Committee on Fisheries - has reached a satisfactory conclusion."
"The amendments Parliament had requested have been introduced and we have managed to end up with a report that is a significant improvement on the Commission's proposal."
"I would therefore like to thank the Commission, the Council and all our colleagues who have supported us."
"Mr President, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it seems hard to believe: the Social Fund is our only labour market policy instrument at European level!"
"It has very successfully introduced new labour market policy measures in the Member States."
"Yet in Berlin it was not provided with anything near the funding that this House and the Commission rightly called for."
"Precisely in the case of the Social Fund, which has repeatedly produced European added value, whether in regard to the policy for the handicapped, in regard to preventive labour market policy or, for instance, to promoting equal opportunities for women, much remained in dispute up the last minute."
"Surely that is a rather topsy-turvy world!"
"It was not our fault."
"We did not call for anything revolutionary."
"Basically we were concerned with five key points to effectively flank the common employment strategy."
"Right at the top of the list was a preventive labour market policy and specific measures for women."
"Preventing unemployment has to be the more humane approach and is also considerably cheaper."
"Surely it is not acceptable that people now speak of the feminisation of poverty Union-wide!"
"Nor is it acceptable that EU-wide women only occupy 3 % of top jobs, and the rate is declining."
"Women still make up the majority of the population."
"And here, gentlemen of the Council, mainstreaming alone is not enough!"
"We were also concerned with doing more to combat social marginalisation, for in the long term it will pay off if these people can manage to support themselves again."
"We also wanted to make the positive experiences gained from the PEACE initiative accessible throughout the Union; under this initiative, NGOs provided small grants that did not involve any great administrative outlay to help people for whom access to public sector jobs represents an impossible threshold to cross."
"Our fifth concern was to make the Member States more aware of the need to cover all the Social Fund intervention areas rather than just picking out their favourites again."
"And let me say again to the Council: you have been aware of these demands since the beginning of the year."
"But that did not stop you from deciding your common position with quite stubborn disregard for this."
"We may well ask ourselves in this House, what is the point then of these informal conciliation meetings?"
"The fact that we now have compromises acceptable to both sides is thanks to us and us alone, because we openly came towards you with compromise proposals to prevent your stubborn attitude from driving us to the Conciliation Committee; for that would have meant having to stall many projects because the money would not have come from Brussels in time."
"That would have been irresponsible, which, I hope, is something nobody here in this House wants!"
"In the end you got round to it after all."
"Even if the percentages of the funding have not been fixed, we have agreed on a more preventive labour market policy and on more specific measures for women."
"Suddenly it did prove possible to enshrine in the regulation the objective of social integration in the labour market."
"In the end we even managed to reach a compromise on global subsidies, which now actually makes it possible to provide up to 100 % support for NGOs."
"The amendments we have now agreed with the Council are Amendments Nos 1, 8, 9 and 10."
"I would ask all Members to support these amendments so that the results of our negotiations are also reflected in the Social Fund regulation."
"There has been very little shift in the Council's position on the five intervention areas."
"We will have to learn to live with that. But on no issue was the Council as inflexible and stubborn as on mainstreaming."
"So it is now up to the Commission to ensure that mainstreaming is incorporated in the national programmes."
"I hope we will also see a few women in the Council in seven years' time."
"It would certainly be a service to the cause!"
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in the first report I presented to the House on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the Council Regulation on structural measures in the fisheries sector, Parliament expressed its support for three basic ideas."
"The first was the need to guarantee sufficient resources in the Community budget to cover the sector's needs in the context of the structural policy for the fisheries sector."
"The second was the need for a single legal framework, in the form of a horizontal regulation, that would bring together the various regulations."
"The third was the need for national programmes, and not only regional programmes, to guarantee that the structural policy was consistent with the fleets' multi-annual guidance programmes."
"On the basis of this strategy, at first reading Parliament brought together in a single regulation both the proposal for a Council Regulation on structural measures in the fisheries sector, which is included in Agenda 2000, and the proposal for a Council Regulation laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector."
"The vote in the House entirely endorsed the positions supported by the Committee on Fisheries. Subsequently, our committee, and particularly its chairman, Carmen Fraga, contacted the Council, the national administrations and the professional organisations to organise a public hearing, which confirmed that Parliament's political position was widely supported."
"With such support, Parliament held various informal meetings with the Council presidency which, I am very pleased to say, has agreed to most of what we wanted, and, since the Berlin European Council, a new proposal for a regulation has even been drawn up, which is at last known as the 'Regulation on the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance'."
"From now on, we will have a single structural basis for fisheries and will not have to finance structural measures under the EAGGF Guarantee Section."
"Equally, we will have horizontal programming in non-Objective 1 regions."
"We will also have a full list of all the actions and measures involved, and on the basis of these concessions from the Council, the Committee on Fisheries has accepted that there will two separate regulations."
"I would like to congratulate the Council and the Commission on the flexibility they demonstrated in reviewing the initial ideas we considered to be mistaken and looking for a satisfactory compromise."
"I would also like to point out that we have made significant changes to the regulation on implementing measures: we have removed the additional 30 % requirement for capacity withdrawn and the arrangements linking joint enterprises to the fisheries agreements."
"I would like to end with a general reference to the Structural Funds pillar of Agenda 2000. In my view, given the backdrop of budgetary rigour, the Council and the Commission have shown good sense in concentrating aid on Objective 1 regions."
"This will allow us to maintain the current levels of support in terms of per capita aid and to maintain the Cohesion Fund. Together, these elements will help us to speed up the structural recovery of the less prosperous countries."
"There is no doubt that our structural policy lacks vital weight to overcome the regional imbalances in the short term. By the same token, however, there is no doubt that the European Union is continuing to preserve some extremely important solidarity mechanisms."
"Perhaps, against this backdrop of budgetary rigour, we can see the importance of the requirement set out in the Treaty that all Community policies - not only structural policies - must be considered from the perspective of economic and social cohesion."
"It may be that in a situation where the debate on net balances determines the solutions, it is somewhat utopian to demand that all Community policies should be aimed at achieving greater economic and social cohesion."
"But in the near future, when we tackle the question of enlargement, we will have to look at this idea in greater detail if we do not want to end up with an enlarged Europe with even greater regional disparities that put the entire system at risk."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will try to help the President by speaking slowly, if possible, and without a text in front of me."
"Up until now, we have talked about how we are going to put our common house - the Union - in order."
"It is now time to look at enlargement."
"This report of mine which is now at second reading discusses the coordination of pre-accession aid for enlargement."
"I feel that I should remind you briefly of the historical task and role of enlargement, not only in terms of Agenda 2000 but also for the European Union. The people of Central and Eastern Europe and of the Mediterranean, the majority of whom have only recently regained their freedom, want to take part in our common historic adventure."
"Since the beginning, Parliament has stated that, in its view, there should be a general process of negotiation involving inclusive criteria, without the creation of new barriers and new discriminations and with the possibility of a fairly competitive environment."
"In other words, we hoped that each and every one of these countries could make the collective effort to restore democracy, restructure their economies and learn to live in harmony with their neighbours that should enable them to participate fully in our future."
"I have drawn up this report on behalf of Parliament and in close cooperation with my colleagues Mr Walter and Mr Sonneveld, and my aim has been to coordinate the aid and to also include Parliament's criteria."
"I must say, Mr President, that we have succeeded in a series of important objectives in this area."
"Firstly, the Commission itself mended its own ways: it amended its initial draft and even changed the title of the regulation as we had requested."
"In short, it is fundamental for helping to strengthen these societies. This is the first objective which, in my opinion, we have managed to modify and improve compared with the initial proposal."
"We have also made significant progress in other areas, such as respect for the existing comitology rules."
"We wanted to ensure that these rules were not changed by any underhand methods. Furthermore, we made progress in terms of Parliament's participation, as there is now the possibility that we might be able to review this process every year."
"Overall, I feel that the solution is satisfactory."
"Naturally, there are some issues that have yet to be resolved and I believe they should be mentioned."
"One of these, which relates to the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, is my belief - which did not receive the support of the House, but now that the Treaty of Amsterdam has entered into force it is assuming great importance - that we should look at this entire process as an overall strategy for the Union that should lead to joint measures."
"In my view, this would also allow us to integrate the policy that we need to develop in this area into our legal and constitutional framework."
"There is another issue that should be mentioned, which it was not officially included but was incorporated in the procedures involving each of the countries."
"It relates to the importance we attach to social dialogue in relation to strengthening the system of production and industrial relations in these countries."
"I would like to mention two other aspects of our approach that have yet to be resolved, although the Council confirms that they are being considered."
"One of these is the importance of restructuring the nuclear industry in most of the countries concerned."
"This is an extremely sensitive issue for most of the Union's citizens."
"And the final aspect - which we hope will also be integrated in the future under the new Commission - relates to the behavioural criteria and the code of conduct that must follow."
"I hope that these two issues can be resolved as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, I am going to speak about pre-accession measures for agriculture."
"In our first report we included a fundamental point concerning the conditions which the Commission proposed applicant countries should fulfill in order to qualify for EU farming subsidies."
"I am referring here to the condition that applicant countries must have drawn up a seven-year rural development plan by 1 January 2000."
"The European Parliament amended this requirement, considering it much too demanding, and proposed a more practical procedure."
"The Council, however, decided to follow the Commission proposal."
"This point was repeatedly on the agenda at the subsequent trialogue meetings, and the Council presidency in particular expressed understanding for the European Parliament's objections."
"Nevertheless, we did not succeed in convincing the Commission and Council that this condition would place an excessive administrative burden on the applicant countries."
"The Council was prepared, however, to abandon the date of 1 January, while maintaining the year 2000. As a result, the difference of opinion in principle with the European Parliament remained unchanged."
"The European Parliament believes it is impossible for the applicant countries to develop a full seven-year integrated rural development programme in a democratic manner within such a short space of time."
"The European Parliament raised the possibility of setting up a small group of experts on the acquis communautaire and the economic development problems facing the former Communist bloc countries, who would act in an advisory capacity in selecting measures and projects."
"At the same time work could continue on drawing up a rural development plan which would consequently be more realistic and of better quality."
"In the meantime, it was decided following the Berlin summit to set up a separate budget category for accession, Category 7, which will also cover the SAPARD support and under which stricter financial rules will apply for prefinancing and financial management and responsibility than would have been the case if Category 1, in other words agriculture, measures continued to apply as the Commission had proposed, or with Category 2, which would have applied if these countries had actually become members."
"It seems that a country in the pre-accession phase must already meet very stringent administrative demands in order to benefit from the SAPARD pre-accession support for agriculture."
"My conclusion is that all the EU bodies have the same desire to achieve successful accessions as soon as possible."
"But in my opinion the European Parliament has better grasped what the EU conditions mean in practice for political life in these countries."
"The other institutions are more focused on accountability and cost management."
"Time for further discussion is running out, however."
"This is why the European Parliament is today formally delivering its opinion, while at the same time expressing its concern at the demanding procedure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur on ISPA, the pre-accession instrument for the applicant countries, and a constant monitor of the general reform of the Structural Funds I am really glad that Parliament is bringing the negotiations on Agenda 2000 to a successful conclusion this week."
"That will send out an important signal, both to the people of the Union and to the Central and Eastern European countries that are seeking EU membership."
"Europe is able to act!"
"The fact that we can now take the definitive vote on Agenda 2000 is not just a matter of course."
"So I want to take this opportunity to specifically congratulate the presidencies of the Council and particularly the German Presidency of the Council on managing to establish a workable run-up to the final spurt."
"In relation to the structural pre-accession instrument ISPA, the Commission, the Council and Parliament broadly followed the same track."
"Through constructive negotiations we have, in my view, achieved a successful overall result that sends out a clear signal of our solidarity with the applicant countries."
"The funding is limited, especially when you look at the immense need for adjustment in the applicant countries."
"That makes it all the more right to concentrate ISPA on supporting projects in the environmental and transport sectors, which are central to economic development, and to interlink this aid closely with other forms of pre-accession aid, in the framework also of PHARE."
"But like the Structural Funds as a whole, and Parliament sees this as a key point, ISPA must make a lasting contribution to job creation."
"We also believe it is important that the recipient countries use this instrument as a means of becoming familiar with and learning to apply the rules and mechanisms of structural policy, which will make integration all the easier later on."
"So it is of the utmost importance for local and regional players to be involved wherever possible."
"Let me also take this opportunity to say something about the EU's future structural policy as a whole."
"We have no cause to jump for joy about the Structural Funds reform."
"However, we have found a workable compromise here that ensures that in future too we do more than just pay lip-service to European solidarity."
"On the contrary!"
"With the new Objectives 1, 2 and 3 and the Community initiatives Interreg, Leader, EQUAL and URBAN we now have powerful instruments at hand which allow us to make a major contribution to making the regions more competitive and creating jobs."
"In concentrating on the most important aspects, it is of course inevitable that some regions will lose Objective 1 and 2 status in the medium term."
"So it is all the more important - and that too is a success achieved by Parliament - that we introduce generous transitional rules to ensure that the regions do not face an unreasonable and painful loss of support but have six years to adjust to the changes."
"I am also pleased and rather proud that the European Parliament managed through tough negotiations with the Commission and the Council to carry through a fourth Community initiative."
"It may be called URBAN but it is something more than the previous URBAN initiative, for in future it will also benefit smaller cities and urban neighbourhoods and will take a broader approach to social and economic regeneration."
"That also largely covers what Parliament aimed to achieve with the fifth Community initiative which we demanded last year in plenary, which means that these possibilities can also be used."
"With this initiative we now have an important additional job-creating instrument."
"Solidarity within the European Union and with the pre-accession states, the concentrated use of resources, job creation, less bureaucracy and preparations for enlargement eastward have been the aims of the Structural Funds reform from the outset."
"We are now taking a decisive step forward."
"I thank all who have helped ensure this, whether in the Council or in the Commission - and quite particularly in the Commission - and who have given us such solid support over the past weeks, months and years."
"I thank them warmly."
"Europe may not be taking giant steps forward, but every step forward is a good step, and I think we are moving forward here."
"Mr President, the report that I introduce is a technical but important part of the Agenda 2000 proposals."
"It is amending the regulation establishing the guarantee fund for external actions."
"Members will recall that this was in fact presented to the House and in November 1998 referred back to committee."
"As a result of it being referred back to committee we now have a situation in which we are today inviting the House to approve the Commission proposal in the form on which political agreement has already been reached in the Council."
"That political agreement was reached at the Vienna Summit and was annexed to the Vienna Summit decisions."
"Essentially, the amendments which have been put by Parliament, through its Committee on Budgets, to the original Commission proposal have been accepted."
"Our Amendment No 2 sought to oblige the Commission to review the parameters of the guarantee fund in its annual reports and now, following the political decision, the Commission must review the parameters of the guarantee fund at the time of each accession."
"Each one of our amendments of that type of technical nature has therefore been agreed and incorporated in the Vienna Council decision."
"The Council also decided to depart from the Commission's original proposal by increasing the target amount to 9 % instead of 8 %, as the Commission had proposed, for the ratio of the fund to the Community's total outstanding liabilities."
"The provisioning rate of the fund was thereby reduced to 9 % for each loan operation, down from the previous 14 %, but still higher than the rate of 6 % that the Commission itself had proposed."
"In total, we have a situation which I feel satisfies all the requirements of Parliament and on that basis I commend it to the House."
"However, in the wider context, it is important to say today that despite all the misgivings there are about some of the details of the interinstitutional arrangement and the financial perspective, it is better to have something which is slightly inadequate in the view of some but is nevertheless agreed, than to go forward seeking perfection and actually get nothing."
"However there is a salutary lesson in this process for Parliament."
"Parliament today has managed to gather less than 5 % of its Members."
"We have become a Parliament in which we merely deliver speeches to each other and there are precious few people here to listen."
"I really think this is a salutary lesson at the end of this Parliament, and the next Parliament has to take it seriously if it expects public opinion to take its debate seriously."
"This Parliament has got to start taking its debates seriously itself."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, the new regulation on the policy to support rural development is without question a major step forward in the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"That is not just because nine separate regulations have been turned into one clear regulation, which is good for transparency and certainly also has an impact on the management of resources, but because it represents the move to a new policy."
"Of course the picture painted by the Commission, of two strong pillars side by side, is a little over-optimistic."
"One of the pillars is not as strong as the other yet, as you know, Commissioner Fischler; but there is still time."
"We must continue to seek, in future too, to make agricultural policy for rural areas a little more flexible, for the Member States and also for the regions."
"Let me remind you of what Commissioner Fischler once said: this policy is so important because we always have to put the question: what will the brother and sister of a young farmer who takes over a farm do on the labour market?"
"This is where it becomes quite clear what we will have to do for the rural areas in future."
"That is why we are still rather attached to our earlier demand that in future of course Parliament must have codecision power over the entire spectrum of the common agricultural policy."
"That is still lacking."
"As I said on another occasion this morning: it is a necessary part of perfecting parliamentary democracy in Europe."
"So you will understand why we agricultural politicians are strongly in favour of supporting the interinstitutional agreement."
"For if it becomes possible to include the accompanying measures, the expenditure on rural areas, under non-compulsory expenditure - which obviously does not mean we do not feel obliged to spend it, but which would give Parliament more say over this increasingly important policy - you will understand our view."
"For the rest, it would have the advantage of allowing for transfers in the case of multiannual expenditure."
"We will have teething problems with this new policy in its early years."
"It would be a pity to lose money because of those teething troubles by not being able to transfer it."
"Overall this is a good start."
"We have not grown a real tree yet, but this little sapling that we have planted together can - if the Commission and the Council nurture it just as carefully - grow into a strong and healthy tree to support rural development policy."
"Applause"
"Mr President, as rapporteur for agricultural policy funding under Agenda 2000, I should like to begin by expressing my appreciation to the German Presidency for the opportunities granted by the German Government for a trialogue on agricultural policy."
"There are obviously a number of differences between the original proposal of Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which was adopted in January, and the outcome of the Berlin summit."
"This was bound to be the case."
"I do not believe anyone can ever be 100 % right in these complex negotiations."
"What we welcome is the fact that for the first time rural policy is a clear component of European agricultural policy, as Mr Görlach also said."
"We also believe it important - and this is also in line with my report - that the Berlin conclusions clearly state that Europe must pay more attention to European food quality, safety, environmental protection, animal welfare, and the rest."
"This must be developed further, and it must also be given emphasis at the WTO negotiations."
"As many people have already said, it is also to be welcomed that rural expenditure and accompanying measures are non-compulsory expenditure."
"As guarantee expenditure is fixed, I should like to ask Mr Fischler whether this means that money will be refunded to the Member States if there is a surplus for a particular year?"
"There was some discussion in my committee about whether or not a reserve fund should be set up."
"There was no mention of this in Berlin, and I therefore assume that it cannot go through."
"Could he confirm whether my assumption is correct that the EUR 200 million and 0.03 % flexibility it includes applies to all categories including Category 1, in other words guarantee expenditure for agriculture?"
"The second question concerns accompanying measures and rural development, where different rules apply."
"If the money is not all used in one year my assumption is that it can be carried over to the next year."
"Would it be possible for the Commission to give a clear statement on how these funds can be used?"
"Little has been said about monitoring agricultural expenditure."
"In its January report Parliament paid particular attention to monitoring, combating fraud and that type of thing."
"Although this is not mentioned in the conclusions of the Berlin summit, I can assure you that Parliament will keep a very close eye on such matters."
"One last question Commissioner Fischler: in our parliamentary resolution we also asked for the hectare subsidies, all income subsidies, to be paid before 31 October of each year."
"Is this possible?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur on the horizontal measures I cannot give you a positive assessment."
"We had a Commission proposal seeking to establish social and environmental criteria for a sliding scale of premium payments."
"Little remains of those criteria."
"Parliament had made proposals that were more distinct; the Commission checked the figures and decided they could ensure that the premiums were distributed sensibly."
"Now none of that is left and I will tell you some of the results."
"Firstly, Mr Fischler, we have not reduced the over-compensation from 1992."
"As in the past, 4 % of holdings will receive 40 % of the premiums, or 20 % of holdings 80 % of the premiums."
"Second point: we have not fully offset the Agenda 2000 price reductions through the premium payments."
"For rationalised holdings, that means full price compensation."
"But smaller farms will suffer from this lower compensation."
"Third point: we are concerned here not with money in the sense of fairness or unfairness or envy but with the fact that the price pressure exerted by holdings that continue to draw on high premium payments through over-compensation will hit the smaller farms and put their survival at risk."
"The money that will now flow from Brussels and from the national treasuries into the large-scale rationalised holdings will be used by them for further rationalisation and growth."
"In these farms, that means job cuts, but it also means jobs losses because of the further destruction of farms in the EU."
"Five: we have sent out wrong signals in this respect, namely that we will continue to concentrate on intervention, in the Central and Eastern European states too, instead of educating them for the market, possibly also for the world market, Mr Fischler!"
"Anyone who wants to produce for the world market is free to do so, but should not then receive public funding."
"Here again we did not take the bold step we should have taken."
"Six: we have maintained the support for maize but not managed to obtain support for pasture land."
"So premiums are being paid for basic fodder production, which is already favoured by natural conditions, and the maintenance of pasture land that is so urgently needed for the ecological survival of entire regions is not eligible for any support or any premium."
"Seven: in reallocating the funds which, in your view too, we are to do from the EAGGF Guarantee section into the second pillar, only a small amount of the funds that would have been available if we had applied the degressive scale have gone to this second pillar."
"The 14 billion that were earmarked for the second pillar in Berlin are not in the funding proposal either."
"On the whole, this is a negative assessment, as it must also be for the Commission, for otherwise you would retrospectively have to revise all the documents you have written to justify Agenda 2000."
"Basically all I have done is quote from them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the COM in beef and veal was one of the delicate aspects of the new CAP for the 2000-2006 period due to the structural imbalances of this market, the effects of the mad cow phenomenon on consumers and the role of livestock farming in land use."
"As rapporteur for this issue, I must point out that in its initial proposal, the Commission had favoured a reform based on a substantial reduction in prices with the aim of increasing our share of the export market in the context of the restrictions imposed by the WTO."
"In January, Parliament supported the proposal in my report: it rejected the Commission's recommendation and voted in favour of limiting the reduction in prices to 15 % rather than the 30 % advocated by the Commission."
"The Council of Ministers finally opted for a reduction of 20 % in three stages."
"The Commission had also recommended granting livestock farmers partial financial compensation for this new reduction in prices."
"Contrary to my recommendations, Parliament did not vote in favour of a substantial increase in the premiums for herds of suckler cows, which actually have a positive effect on our land."
"But the Council has done so and it is duly noted."
"Finally, as regards the management of the market, Parliament voted to maintain public intervention and increase controls over production. This was contrary to the Commission's wishes, since it proposed to balance the markets through the reduction in production prices and the introduction of private storage in 2002."
"The Council agreed with the Commission's reasoning but it retained the concept of ad hoc public intervention where necessary and the plan to introduce a 'security net' of EUR 1 560 per tonne."
"It is on this point that I am proposing that Parliament vote in favour of an additional amendment to my report which has the support of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"In fact, the Council's position on market intervention needs to be clarified because, on the one hand, it accepts the option of private storage, yet on the other, it is in favour of maintaining ad hoc public intervention."
"What exactly does this mean?"
"I do not actually believe in the virtues of private storage for managing production with a structural surplus."
"For proof of this, we need look no further than the results this system has produced in the pigmeat sector."
"Furthermore, since I believe that it is equally vital to reach a compromise with the Council and the Commission, I simply proposed a compromise amendment to Parliament's Committee on Agriculture - which it accepted - that involved strengthening the 'security net' by increasing it from EUR 1 560 per tonne to EUR 2 000 per tonne."
"In this way, we could continue along the same lines as our vote in Parliament in January and, at the same time, ensure greater security for our livestock farmers, that is, if the Council and the Commission have the good sense to support us."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioners, the effects of the basic agreement on the Agenda 2000 agricultural reform on agriculture in the European Union and on farm incomes are less negative than the original Commission proposals since the price reductions are lower for cereals, beef and veal. You know that."
"With the introduction of rural development measures and the strengthening of the accompanying measures that have existed since the 1992 reform, we have taken a further step towards a global agricultural policy for rural areas."
"In my view the following aspects of this agricultural reform give rise to considerable doubts."
"The European agricultural model sketched out at the Cork conference has only been implemented in fragmentary form."
"While the measures relating to market organisations, price reductions and so forth are to be applied on a strictly central basis, the implementation of most rural development measures will be left to the discretion of the Member States."
"Or if you like, it will be a purely political decision."
"Why?"
"The rural development measures are financed as non-compulsory expenditure under Category 1."
"The ceiling of EUR 4.3 billion a year can be regarded on the one hand as safeguarding rural development appropriations but on the other hand there is the risk that because the Member States would have to cofinance these measures they will not apply them or will do so only to a limited extent."
"Here I am thinking, for instance, of measure 2078, concerning environmentally compatible farming."
"The direct compensation payments intended to offset the price reductions are not sufficient to make up for income losses."
"The additional expenditure for rural development measures is discretionary in terms of amount and use and is no substitute for the loss of purchasing power resulting from the price reductions."
"The Commission was requested to submit an interim report on most of the market organisation regulations in the year 2002."
"We will see how things turn out."
"We greet the postponement of the reduction in milk prices to the year 2005, primarily for reasons of economy, with a certain joy."
"But it will not be nearly enough and we will still have a quota up to the year 2008."
"That is something that we can in fact live with quite easily and which at least enables us to offer our farmers some security, production security, in this area."
"I believe that in addition to optional set-aside, that is the key result we in Parliament have managed to achieve."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of Mr Fantuzzi."
"I would like to express my support for his report, and particularly the proposal that aid to the sunflower sector be staggered in line with the amendment approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"We have today come to the end of our debate on the Agenda 2000 agricultural reform, a reform which, in my view, has partially lost its common European focus and been distorted by the plans of various Member States."
"I would even go so far as to say that, in handling these proposed reforms, the European Commission - which is the driving force for action in the European Union - has given the impression that it was not very sure where it was heading."
"Faced with some initial radical proposals aimed at encouraging European agriculture to give greater consideration to market indications and international references, it was finally agreed that the terms involved should be clarified and even that some of the sectors to be reformed should be excluded, such as the milk products sector. Its reform is being postponed until 2005 and there is no doubt that in the meantime the imbalances it suffers will become more marked."
"Faced with the initial proposals to strengthen the link between agriculture and the environment in order to put an end to certain problems that have emerged, such as soil and water deterioration, attacks on biodiversity and so on, the Commission is proposing in the horizontal regulation that it should be the Member States who define the compulsory and general environmental standards and determine the penalties to be applied, thereby avoiding any Community focus."
"Faced with the criteria for shaping an agricultural policy that focuses more on the structural nature of certain problems through a rural development policy that is capable of resolving some of the problems facing the countryside - the need for diversification, the need to provide the people with new opportunities and the need to prevent the constant depopulation - a minimal rural development policy has instead been chosen that lacks any real weight."
"Faced with a situation where the agricultural policy must also respond to the principles of economic and social cohesion and correct certain excesses, such as the concentration of aid in the hands of a few, the Commission's response is to say that the Member States will be responsible for reducing imports, thereby rejecting an essential Community focus and the inclusion of general principles."
"Commissioner, you recently stated in Madrid that we might have to start talking about a new reform in 2003."
"I think that this message is dangerous for two reasons."
"Firstly, coming from the lips of the very author of the reform, it highlights the fact that the current measures will not be effective enough, and this is even before we apply them."
"Secondly, it is impossible for European farmers and stockbreeders to continue to work and plan their future without even a basic stable framework."
"We cannot add uncertainties resulting from political decisions to the uncertainties that already exist because of the climate."
"In short, the agreement may satisfy one or more of the Member States, but I do not believe that it rises to the challenges set out in Agenda 2000, including even that of enlargement."
"And to those of my fellow countrymen who are enthusiastic about what has been decided, I would simply suggest that they should do their sums not only in absolute but also in relative terms."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the common organisation of the market in wine is undoubtedly the most complex of all the COMs."
"Apart from the aspects involved in regulating the vineyards and the conditions for producing grapes, we also need to take account of all the rules on oenological practices, that is, the processing of wine, as well as the rules on labelling."
"Wine-growing in Europe is indeed very specific."
"Every region has its own characteristics."
"Every vineyard is different in terms of its product and its quality. This clearly demonstrates that wine is an agricultural product rather than an industrial product and that it must be treated as such."
"The land is also different and this diversity must be respected."
"I am pleased that, after several meetings and discussions, our proposals now reflect the Council's position on many different aspects. At a structural level, the principle of the right of expansion has been accepted."
"Vineyards with a developing market will be able to obtain additional planting rights and the duration of these planting rights has been extended so as to allow for the rest period needed by the land between plantings. Moreover, structural measures have been introduced to support the renewal of vineyards, and we have managed to obtain support for this aspect."
"Few changes have been made in relation to the producer organisations, apart from an agreement allowing us to do away with the measures on the extension of their powers and to preserve, for their members alone, the tasks they are entrusted with. In terms of the recognition of interbranch organisations, these organisations have been granted a specific legal status in Community law in order to prevent them from being challenged by non-producing Member States."
"As regards oenological practices, the preservation of traditional methods has been recognised, while as regards labelling, a direct labelling system has been adopted. Finally, Parliament was satisfied with the measures approved by the Council in relation to musts imported from third countries."
"As you can see, the Council's compromise very closely reflects Parliament's proposals and we welcome that. However, it is not completely perfect."
"Some new decisions by the Council are of great concern and, in my view, are inadmissible, particularly the desire to include in the wine-growing zone new Member States that are not traditionally wine-producing nations, that is, Ireland, Denmark and Sweden."
"If this decision were implemented, it would undermine the content of our compromise and the spirit in which we reached agreement, that is, in the belief that our European wines were recognised as agricultural rather than industrial products, grown in traditional regions and produced using traditional methods. This decision would go against that spirit since we might eventually see in these new wine-producing countries a shift towards using grape musts from third countries."
"Therefore, in order to stave off this threat, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted in favour of an amendment that excludes the possibility of extending the wine-growing zone to include any Member State other than those set out in the amendment."
"Finally, the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development believe that it is vital to establish an action and information programme to make consumers aware, in particular, of the positive effects of vine products on their health."
"As a result, we are tabling an amendment to this end, which I will refer to as 'vine products and health'."
"Do not forget, Commissioner, that wine-growing plays an important role in Europe, it costs very little and it has a high return."
"Mr President, the aim of my report is to provide the European Union with the financial and budgetary framework it needs to enable it to meet the challenges of the next few years."
"This is the question we considered and I will admit that there is no easy answer to it; note the use of present tense here."
"We have been thinking about and working on this for a long time: the Committee on Budgets spent many hours debating, 22 working documents were discussed and a resolution was drawn up, which was approved by the House a few months ago."
"I would like to take this opportunity to mention the excellent work of the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets, which was always available to help me, and to thank my colleagues for their contributions and their patience."
"I was involved in establishing the method for the financial perspective at the time of the 1987-1988 budgetary crisis, which led to the so-called 'Delors I package'. I was also Parliament's rapporteur for the 1993 Agreement."
"As a result, I am very aware of the difference between dealing with a budget with a financial perspective and without a financial perspective."
"The Interinstitutional Agreements and their financial perspectives have represented an important step forward for the Community. They have enabled us to develop the European budget in a calm and organised fashion and to fulfill a broad range of political objectives."
"For example, we have been able to control the unchecked increase in agricultural expenditure, consolidate and develop the cohesion policy, which is essential for economic convergence and political solidarity, integrate events such as the reunification of Germany into the Community budget, and make progress in reducing the Council's powers in the area of compulsory expenditure."
"Therefore, faced with the challenges of the launch of the euro, enlargement to include the CEECs, and the essential reforms of the CAP and the structural policies, I recommended at the time that we should try to conclude a new interinstitutional agreement, even if it was against a backdrop of even greater austerity, if possible."
"In any event, I would remind you that between 1988 and 1999, we approved and implemented Community budgets totalling just under EUR 110 000 million below the own resources ceiling."
"Given the restrictive financial perspective proposed by the now caretaker Commission, Parliament's offer was clear and logical: flexibility and political progress."
"This was summed up in the resolution we approved in Brussels on 4 December 1997."
"To achieve this, we stepped up our contacts with the Commission and the Council, organised more tripartite talks and even held an informal seminar in Vienna with the presidency and the Commission to look at the issue of flexibility."
"We also decided in December that we wanted to withdraw the so-called 'strategic amendments' to the 1999 budget, and just before the Berlin European Council, our chairman, Mr Samland, sent a letter to the 15 Finance Ministers informing them of the figures the European Parliament considered to be the absolute minimum requirements, the so-called 'minima minimorum '."
"The results can be presented in many ways, Mr President-in-Office."
"In its resolution of 14 April, the European Parliament did not share the idyllic version set out by the Council this morning."
"Any expectations we had of cuts were surpassed in Berlin."
"Agricultural spending was frozen, the structural policy was cut by 20 %, and internal policies were cut by 54 %, if we exclude the framework programme for research."
"We were then given a mandate to negotiate."
"We did not touch the figures for Categories 1 and 2 as we took over those from the committees responsible for the relevant legislation."
"Although it was stated that the agreements reached in Berlin could not be changed, we have managed to obtain a further EUR 1 480 million for Category 3, which would remain - so to speak - at the 1999 level in terms of constant prices, and a further EUR 1.1 billion for administrative expenditure."
"The allocations for the flexibility instrument agreed on in Berlin have increased sevenfold."
"A series of preexisting detailed agreements were consolidated. A permanent solution is being proposed for the dispute over the classification of compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure, which goes back to 1982."
"Moreover, part of the CAP expenditure is being transferred to non-compulsory expenditure. Perhaps the final say still rests with the Council, which approves the regulations, but this is an extremely symbolic step and it opens a door to the future."
"This is a brief summary of the basic points that convinced the Committee on Budgets to change its mind on Monday night about rejecting the Interinstitutional Agreement and to call on the House to accept it along with the corresponding financial perspective."
"And this is also the position of the Socialist Group, which I am now representing, as I have changed hats."
"You will have noticed that my three minutes' speaking time as rapporteur has run out."
"Up until now, I have fulfilled my institutional role."
"Now, if you will allow me, I should like to briefly set out my own personal view."
"I would like to thank my group, and particularly my colleague Mr Samland, who has allowed me to use his speaking time in the knowledge that I am going to speak against the majority position."
"In my opinion, each of our governments went to Berlin to see what was in it for them, and very few, if any, looked to see what was in it for Europe."
"As far as I am concerned, that was a step backwards for European integration."
"I would like to know what Mr Prodi honestly thinks of all this."
"Does he believe that he will be able to do what he announced yesterday in this very House with these appropriations?"
"The Council told us this morning, for example, about a possible method for combating unemployment, yet it is cutting the budgetary framework for such measures."
"I want an agreement, but not just any agreement."
"And as far as I can see, this agreement would be of less use to us than the strict application of Article 272 of the Treaty."
"Moreover, when push comes to shove any flexibility we achieve is made rigid and open to criticism by the Council."
"Between the 1.27 % - which we criticised in December 1997 - and the 0.97 % agreed in Berlin, there was enough room for manoeuvre to reach an agreement which would have been rigorous yet better for Europe. I am prepared to accept a figure of 1.13 % if we add enlargement, although who knows when enlargement will take place."
"I would like to remind you that the two previous Interinstitutional Agreements entered into force five and seven months respectively after the budget period being planned."
"There are no funds in this package for essential policies."
"We are freezing Category 3."
"In Category 4, there is only a statement in case the crisis in Kosovo calls for a review of the financial perspective. And we are told that the Council would be prepared to accept such a review before the entry into force of the financial perspective it wants us to adopt today."
"When Spain and Portugal joined the Community, Parliament raised the ceilings for budgetary increases that were established in the MRI."
"But now the applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe are being offered a pittance and told that, if they join, they will be treated with kid gloves."
"We talk about powers yet, in my view, we are only looking at things in terms of their face value."
"With this Interinstitutional Agreement, the Council would de facto approve the budget for seven years."
"Parliament has no political leeway."
"Therefore, since I am in favour of more Europe, although with the same budget - and I do not believe we can achieve it with any less - I cannot in all conscience recommend that the House approve this agreement."
"Mr President, I should like first to speak on the Committee on Budgets' opinion for the second reading of Mr Arias Cañete's report: arrangements and conditions for structural assistance in the fisheries sector."
"His report already includes budget amendments on technical assistance."
"However, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I must ask the House not to support Amendments 5, 53 and 54, which do not follow the principles of the regulation."
"Turning to my second reading recommendation for Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks, this work is being carried out under the old Treaty and now recognises the coming into force of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"There have been many meetings and the Commission and Council have moved a long way to converge around the European Parliament's position."
"I would like to thank the Commission and the hard-working German presidency of the Council for their cooperation in this codecision-type procedure."
"The Committee on Budgets have supported the proposal to involve private capital in financing network projects and has raised the possibility of increasing this from 1 % to 2 %."
"We have supported Galileo, the proposed European global positioning technology, and we have supported the Committee on Transport in its wish to have 55 % of the funding ring-fenced for railways and a maximum of 25 % for roads."
"I believe this report strengthens Community involvement in the construction of networks."
"The funding is a contribution to the projects."
"It will act as an economic multiplier and provide many jobs."
"Peripheral regions will benefit and business will have reduced costs in the global markets."
"However, the total amount has been in doubt."
"The figure in the first reading, which the House voted yesterday, was EUR 5.5 billion."
"Following Dresden, Berlin and intensive negotiations I am recommending that the figure be EUR 4.6 billion."
"Unfortunately, the Council is unable to rise as far as this."
"Its sticking-point was EUR 4.5 billion, and it was starting from a very low base of 3.2."
"It was up to the Council to agree our figure or start the whole process of codecision once again."
"I am delighted to report to the House that the Council agreed to 4.6 billion at its meeting this morning."
"Mr President, I commend this report and its 21 amendments to the House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Commission submitted its proposals on the reform of the Structural Funds in March 1998, there was some doubt as to whether a genuine reform could be achieved and whether the regulations could be adopted early enough to enable the new programmes to begin according to plan early in 2000."
"Today I most particularly thank the rapporteurs Mrs McCarthy, Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Collins, Mr Walter, Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Arias Cañete, in his capacity also as Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy."
"I believe that together with Council we have managed actually to achieve what many people considered unlikely."
"Earlier on I set out the basic principles of the Structural Funds reform, so I will not bore you now with my specific position on each amendment, because according to my understanding of all your contributions to the discussion, you want to follow the procedure we agreed."
"Certainly you would have liked to see better results in one or other respect, as we would too, but it is our joint understanding that we have now gone as far as we could and really do want to transpose this into concrete legislative acts."
"So I just want to go into a few very specific questions."
"On the subject of islands: I have noted during many of our discussions in this Chamber how many islanders belong to this Parliament, and I am indeed all in favour of that."
"But I think that islanders also agree with the broad majority of Parliament and the Commission that the principle of economic and social cohesion primarily applies to the poorest and structurally weakest regions, which is indeed why we want to allocate 70 % of all funding to these regions, regardless of whether their inhabitants live on the mainland or on an island."
"If we are honest with each other we know that there is no point in making insularity as such a criterion for support, for as it says in the Treaty, structural aid is granted to compensate for the disadvantages of certain regions and social groups, and in their interests we should adhere to that principle."
"For if we do not, we will end up harming precisely those whom we all want to help most."
"Incidentally, the same applies to a number of other requests for Structural Funds aid."
"These funds are not a pot of money that people can freely dip into if they need more money for something; they are the means to a quite specific end, namely to promote the economic and social cohesion of this Union and to give practical application to the principle that solidarity is one of the vital foundations of the continued existence of the European Union."
"And that is why we do not have a cultural fund as such either but finance cultural measures in exactly the same way as tourism measures if, firstly, they serve to create jobs and, secondly, they promote regional development; but we are not an institute of culture pure and simple."
"As for the transitional rules discussed here, or the fact that some assistance has to be phased out, we are not trying to be mean but are taking account of the fact that some regions have made progress and that we always care for the poorest first and cannot give further support to the rich, who will then slowly move closer to the average."
"Mrs Schroedter brought up the famous list of favours again."
"I think it is important to note that in all this accounts for no more than 2 % of total funding and that one could say it has no influence at all on the structural decisions of the Funds."
"I also want to point out quite clearly that such important initiatives as the PEACE initiative also come under it."
"To prevent any misunderstanding, let me say to Mr Arias Cañete in regard to the fisheries measures that there are some amendments that the Commission does not accept because they relate to measures that require a Council decision which we cannot simply anticipate at this point."
"Moreover, we want to see the measures relating to the fishing fleet reformed and do not agree with your proposals in this regard."
"Otherwise I think it is clear that on the whole Parliament has been most successful."
"I thank you all for your very close and trusting cooperation."
"I forgot to thank the rapporteurs Mr Varela and Mrs Jöns so let me do so now."
"I am glad that with the new code of conduct, which adjusts past procedures to the new legal situation, this close cooperation will continue in future too and I hope that it will also be carried over to the new Parliament."
"I would like to say a few words about the Social Fund."
"Here in particular Parliament has codecision, and your concerns are clearly evident in the new text."
"In fact Parliament's support for and contribution to the reform has been crucial."
"I would like particularly to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, for her excellent work here."
"We can be proud of the results in four particular areas: the universal agreement on the overarching priority of employment and the Social Fund's mission to underpin the European employment strategy; secondly, the confirmation of the thematic structure of the funds regulation and the scope of the five policy fields, extending from active labour market policies, through social inclusion, lifelong learning and adaptability, to positive action for women; thirdly, we have maintained and strengthened the commitment to support non-governmental organisations and the combating of social exclusion - we share the view that the regulation must oblige Member States to provide for small grants with special access arrangements for non-governmental organisations and local partnerships: fourthly, again with the support of Parliament, we have strengthened the equal opportunities provisions and the mainstreaming principle of the regulation."
"Today's plenary session provides the opportunity for Parliament to influence the final shape of the regulation, now as co-legislator."
"The Commission would be very happy to recommend the compromise amendments put forward by the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, covering: the addition of social integration into the labour market to Article 1, namely Amendment No 1; the new wording on the social economy third system in Article 2, namely Amendment No 8; the importance which both the Commission and Parliament feel needs to be attached to the principles of equal opportunity and adaptability, namely Amendment No 9; and the better arrangements that you are proposing for the operation of small grants with special access arrangements for non-governmental organisations, namely Amendment No 10."
"As regards the mainstreaming amendment I agree that the principle is essential but it is already covered both in the general regulation and in Article 2 of the regulation itself."
"So given the problems which it might cause in the Council I would incline, as the rapporteur does, to agree, and to argue against acceptance."
"Once the structural funds regulations for the new period are in place the Social Fund will enjoy a new lease of life in view of the increased emphasis given to the employment dimension in all Community policies and in the Structural Funds in particular."
"We would all be proud of the ongoing success of the European employment strategy, which is the European Union's chief response to the need for more and better jobs."
"We have intentionally defined the scope of the fund to allow it to respond to developments in the economy and the labour market over the next seven years, always with a view to encouraging and enabling more people to participate actively in the labour market."
"To do this we must focus more strongly than ever on activation instruments which help people to become more employable, rather than passive policies."
"At the same time we should make every effort to strengthen the element of prevention to stop people becoming unemployed in the first place, a point very effectively made by the rapporteur."
"It is only through this flexible, forward-looking and, above all, inclusive approach that Europe will be able to meet the economic and social challenges of the new millennium."
"The Social Fund is the one Structural Fund directed exclusively at the individual person."
"It is about enabling individuals to progress into the new millennium; about letting people themselves make that progress through training and education, by increasing their chances of getting a job, about helping them to move forward over time to a better job and to a better standard of living."
"This is why the Social Fund, acting alongside the employment strategy, is so important for the future of Europe."
"Employment still largely defines a person's standard of life and weighs heavily on their expectations of what they can contribute to society and what society can offer to them."
"Increasing people's chances of keeping their jobs, getting a job or a better job is what we can do with the support of the European Social Fund."
"I believe that as a result of the work that has taken place between the institutions and taking on the amendments that I mentioned earlier, we have made the text as good as it can be got at this time."
"I commend it to you and ask you to support it and to support the rapporteur in her proposals too."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there has of course been a great deal of discussion about the Berlin decisions in the agriculture sector over the last few weeks."
"Very different views have also been expressed in today's debate."
"Let me make my position clear."
"The reform certainly does not go quite as far as we had hoped, which gives rise to a degree of uncertainty as also of risk."
"But at the same time we should not underestimate what we have achieved."
"The Berlin agreement, following the Agriculture Council's compromise, provides for a reduction of only 15 % in cereal prices and the approximation of oilseed aid to the reduced cereal aid, and provides that the reform of the milk sector will not begin until the year 2000."
"Nevertheless this remains without doubt the most far-reaching reform the Union has ever undertaken in the agriculture sector."
"This is all the more true in that even in the run-up to it the tobacco and olive oil sector were also reformed."
"But above all there is one thing we should not forget, namely that the Heads of State and Government decided these reforms unanimously and that the direction agricultural policy was to follow in the coming years was therefore determined unanimously."
"That gives us a distinctly stronger position in the coming international discussions and negotiations."
"Let me briefly outline the main reasons for the reform and the central elements of the overall agreement reached."
"In the cereal sector and the beef and veal sector in particular, the analyses carried out by the Commission showed that there is a serious risk of production surpluses increasing again soon after the year 2000."
"In view of that situation, in principle we were faced with the choice of two courses: either we could choose the increasingly rigid control of supply and make that the core of the common agricultural policy, or we could adjust our policy in such a way as to enable us to sell to new, additional markets."
"It was decided in Berlin that in the longer term we want to choose the second course, which means we have to make European agriculture more competitive."
"We must also take greater account of justified consumer concerns."
"This stronger market orientation will be counterbalanced by higher direct payments and additional opportunities to open up new income sources within and outside farming."
"In Berlin we also made significant progress towards sustainable agriculture by managing to incorporate environmental concerns more firmly than before in market policy and rural development policy."
"Moreover, the Agenda decisions created a second pillar of the common agricultural policy."
"It is true that this second pillar is still a little less solid than the first."
"But we have laid the foundation stone for it and in principle that pillar now exists."
"In future we shall probably have to consider how to consolidate it."
"In the budget, we will in future have two sub-ceilings for agricultural expenditure."
"This subdivision into compulsory expenditure and non-compulsory expenditure was decided in Berlin and confirmed here in Parliament."
"It means we now have one upper limit for traditional guarantee expenditure and a second upper limit for rural development."
"That will of course make everything rather more rigid, and also to some extent less flexible."
"I can understand why Parliament insists on this aspect, in its capacity as budgetary authority, and I hope that budgetary discipline does not mean inflexibility."
"For that would tend to weaken this second pillar, the more innovative part of the policy."
"Overall, the reform that was agreed in Berlin represents an important step forward."
"Yet certain risks and imponderables remain."
"In particular, nobody can tell today whether the lower price guarantee reductions agreed in the final compromise will be enough to really achieve market balance."
"In the preparations for the new WTO negotiations and the enlargement negotiations we will have to take due account of these constraints, as we will do when we implement the organisation of the market in coming years."
"But there are certainly also some grounds for confidence."
"We will enter into the WTO negotiations with very clear ideas about the kind of agriculture we want in Europe: a competitive and sustainable agriculture that supplies the consumer with high-quality products."
"And that is also the agricultural model that we want to offer our partners in Eastern Europe, together with the new, second CAP pillar."
"Let me conclude with a few comments on the amendments."
"First, I do agree that we should strengthen rural development policy, but to strengthen the measures for the disadvantaged regions without increasing the funding would mean having to divert these funds from other rural development measures."
"Secondly, in the Commission's view intervention buying at higher prices in the beef and veal sector would lead to new, unmarketable surpluses and exert considerable pressure on the budget, as also on our market prices."
"If the cuts in oilseed payments were extended over a four-year period that would postpone the lifting of the Blair House restrictions by another year and also require more budget funds that are not covered."
"Turning to Mr Mulder's question about transferability: I too think we should discuss this matter further."
"I consider it most important that, over and above the time span, we manage to develop enough flexibility in relation to that part of rural development to make it possible actually to use the available resources."
"As for the payment deadline of 31 October, I am prepared to give further consideration to this question, though with the reservation that this must not lead to any shift in the financial year for compulsory expenditure."
"In reply to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf I would point out that the new agricultural policy certainly will bring about a shift in this 80: 20 ratio and that under the reform the smaller farmers will in fact have distinctly greater opportunities than they used to."
"For the rest I would also point out that the Commission never proposed aiming at full price equalisation."
"We never spoke of anything more than income equalisation, which does not automatically mean the same thing."
"Finally, let me give warm thanks to all the rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation."
"My special thanks today go to the long-standing chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Colino Salamanca."
"Applause"
"This is the last debate on the future of the common agricultural policy in which you will be taking part in this House."
"I thank you on behalf of the Commission, but also very much on my own behalf, for the important work you have done for the benefit of European agriculture. I also wish you all the best for the future!"
"Applause"
"Mr President, I would like to ask Commissioner Fischler a supplementary question."
"Can I assume that the Commission accepts those amendments in the second report, such as those on the milk sector, which you did not mention?"
"Mr Goepel, I did not go into that question because it did not come up in the statement made by the rapporteur on the milk sector during the debate. But I can tell you this much: we are prepared to return to the earlier formula and review the milk market in the year 2003."
"The financial perspectives for 2000-2006 and the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and improving the budgetary procedure are an integral part of the package of Agenda 2000."
"I understand from the reports and intervention of Mr Colom i Naval that there are different views in the European Parliament on this item."
"Let me for that reason point out some of the principal reasons why the Commission supports the agreement."
"It is true that the conclusions of the European Council of Berlin with regard to the financial perspectives for 2000-2006 remain below the Commission proposal."
"But the subsequent negotiations, under pressure from the European Parliament delegation, achieved substantial improvements."
"For internal policies the proposal in front of you exceeds the conclusions of Berlin by EUR 1.5 billion."
"These will permit the financing of the multiannual priority programmes, for example, trans-European networks."
"And it safeguards a significant margin for new policy initiatives."
"For external actions there is a clear commitment from the Council to finance additional needs arising from the situation in the Balkans, if necessary, by means of a revision of the financial perspectives."
"With regard to administrative expenditure, the agreement would permit the financing of some 1000 new posts for the Community institutions and also finance the new Statute of the Members of the European Parliament, even though a solution on that issue is not yet clear as you know."
"The new interinstitutional agreement also marks significant progress on key questions of the budget procedure."
"The agreement clarifies the classification of expenditure which defines the budgetary powers of Council and Parliament."
"This removes a perpetual source of conflict."
"In the process, Parliament has widened its budgetary powers in the field of agriculture expenditure."
"Furthermore, the agreement provides for full cooperation between both branches of the budgetary authority on all parts of the budget, which Parliament has long fought for."
"Mr President, without the agreement these procedural gains would be lost."
"There would be a high risk of an annual budget confrontation."
"This would not be in the interests of the Union and its policies."
"Secondly, I want to reply to Lord Tomlinson on his report."
"Firstly, the Commission is pleased with the agreement by the Council because that takes into account the major part of the preoccupations of the European Parliament."
"On the amendments proposed in Lord Tomlinson's report, the Commission is ready to accept Amendments 1 and 2."
"As far as Amendments 3 and 4 are concerned, the Commission has accepted a joint declaration in the regulation according to which the Commission will give all oral information to the Council and Parliament on the economic situation of the beneficiary countries which are receiving loans and on the risks which I have explained when the annual report is presented."
"For that reason the Commission does not find it necessary to introduce these Amendments 3 and 4 into the regulation of the Guarantee Fund."
"Mr President, I would like to repeat a question I asked earlier and the answer can be just 'yes' or 'no'."
"My question was whether the flexibility of 200 million and 0.03 % applies to all the categories of the budget, including category 1."
"'Yes'."
"Laughter"
"I should like to begin by welcoming the agreement between the Council and Parliament on the trans-European networks financial regulation."
"This vital component of the Agenda 2000 package has the twin distinctions of being the first legal text arising from Agenda 2000 that achieved a common position in the Council and yet the last to be agreed by the Council and the European Parliament."
"It also is one of the first legal acts to be adopted under the codecision procedure set down in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"I hope that the amicable and productive precedent shown here will be followed on many other occasions."
"It may be that I am displaying an excess of optimism in my old age!"
"Much of the credit for achieving the agreement goes to the rapporteur, Mr Kellett-Bowman, whom I am glad to see in the House."
"He has shown a real understanding of the financing requirements of the trans-European networks and a determination to put in place a stable long-term framework for the financing of major TENs projects."
"His colleagues like Mr Samland and others - whom I am also glad to see in the House - have helped produce a very productive and effective package."
"Clearly the most important issue is the overall financial envelope of EUR 4.6 bn over the 2000-2006 period."
"That sum is more modest than the Commission's opening bid."
"But I am glad to say that it represents a real increase of around 10 % and is fully consistent with the lower ceiling for internal policies that was agreed at the Berlin Summit."
"Apart from the useful increase in funding, the new financial regulation is a major step forward as an appropriate instrument for providing long-term finance for long-term projects because it includes multiannual programming, which means that project promoters will be able to plan with unprecedented certainty about the finance they can expect from the trans-European networks budget."
"That is particularly important for the development and encouragement of public/private partnerships."
"Other important elements of the revised regulation include, first, a truly new facility for the investment of TENs money in risk capital funds with the aim of gaining access to the potentially very large resources of long-term funding available from insurance companies and pension funds for the financing of public infrastructure projects."
"Second, the regulation provides for the possibility of financing up to 20 % of the Galileo satellite navigation project - around EUR 500 m - and doing so from the TENs budget."
"That component is essential in order to demonstrate that this vital project can be financed and also to ensure that it develops as a genuinely European project."
"I hope that any discussion of European Union finance for innovative TENs projects at the current European Council will confirm the importance of Galileo for European producers and for European users."
"With the news today, from COREPER that the Council can accept the compromise reflected in the amendments before us today."
"I can also confirm full support from the Commission for Parliament's position."
"I therefore look forward to early adoption of the revised regulation in good time for the implementation of multiannual programming that will commence in the year 2000."
"I express gratitude - not just from the Commission but much more widely from the general public in the Community and from industry - for the foresight and the commitment demonstrated by Parliament on this issue."
"Mr President, let me just say to the Commissioners here present that our joy at the conclusion of the trans-European networks and of the already concluded fifth framework programme of research is still slightly clouded."
"I will add another drop of water so that you do not open the champagne too soon."
"Both questions were explicitly tied to a new financial perspective."
"If Parliament does not agree tomorrow to give its assent to a new interinstitutional agreement, then we will not have the financial framework which we have just discussed and on the basis of which the two agreements, on the fifth framework programme of research and on the trans-European networks, were concluded."
"I just wanted to say this now, as a reservation, before the champagne starts to flow."
"I have been under the distinct impression for four and a half years that Mr Samland could turn water into wine."
"I am looking to great things!"
"Laughter"
"That would be a new kind of magic."
"We shall now move on to the general debate."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to focus on the European Social Fund."
"We have perhaps come to the end of a long task which started with an own-initiative report by the European Parliament on the European Social Fund."
"We must acknowledge the fact that the Commission has accepted the European Parliament's position on objectives and priorities, as well as on procedures."
"Here I want to stress an important point: the close link between the European Social Fund priorities and the employment guidelines."
"The European Social Fund is certainly the basic Community instrument for applying the four pillars, especially employability, and the regulation we are discussing today is consistent with the objectives of social integration and non-discrimination."
"Considering work as both an economic opportunity and a way of achieving one's potential means more and better education lifelong. It means combatting material inequalities and the modern inequalities which affect an individual's ability to plan his own future freely."
"All that makes the European Social Fund a fundamental instrument, and likewise makes it fundamentally important for the NGOs and the third sector to be involved right from the planning stage, principally through a policy of practical integration."
"That will certainly be the responsibility of the Member States, but it will also be up to the Commission to monitor and control it."
"I would like to conclude by taking up a point already mentioned by Mrs Jöns: the Council's unwillingness to become explicitly involved in gender mainstreaming, one of the four pillars of European employment strategy, is incomprehensible - and it is especially incomprehensible now the Treaty of Amsterdam has come into force, enshrining equal opportunities as a fundamental principle of the Union."
"I hope the Council will be willing to accept the amendments from the European Parliament to complete this journey in rapid time and to the satisfaction of all the European institutions."
"Mr President, I too am going to talk about the European Social Fund but in relation to external economic relations. This is because I was the draftsman of the opinion on this for the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"Social promotion is naturally determined in the first instance by meeting the basic needs of our citizens and there is clearly much to do in this area."
"Yet this must be achieved if we are to maintain the European social model we can be proud of. However, we must remember that this must be a realistic model where the improvement in working conditions reflects the improvement in productivity."
"This is where Agenda 2000 has to come in, by providing the resources which are essential for the continuation of this model together with the infrastructures cofinanced by the ERDF, the EAGGF Guidance Section or the Cohesion Fund. It must also provide training or reassign the workforce with the support of the Social Fund."
"Given the current state of globalisation, it would be unacceptable to aim to compete with less-developed countries by reducing wages or allowing a deterioration in working conditions in our continent."
"However, we also cannot accept a protectionist approach such as the strategy where we were digging our own grave and running away from our responsibilities towards the rest of the world, particularly the less-developed areas."
"In everyone's interest, we must move towards a strategy of openness in which we and others clearly respect the rules of traditional trade. In this way, Europe surely has an important role to play through competition conditions which depend largely on the training of individuals."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have come to the end of this debate on Agenda 2000, and tomorrow the House will surely approve these regulations, with which I believe we have managed to improve one of the Union's fundamental objectives: economic and social cohesion and better territorial cohesion."
"This improved economic and social cohesion should bring with it the creation of jobs and thereby attack the European Union's main problem: unemployment."
"In my view, Commissioner, an excellent and positive reform of the Structural Funds has been concluded, with projects aimed at concentration and simplification and with an effective partnership as a result of the contribution of regional and local authorities, which may lead to increased efficiency in the actual implementation of the Structural Funds."
"We have also taken an important step with the reduction of Community initiatives, and you have been particularly keen to ensure that only the Community initiatives with a European dimension are accepted."
"A final decision by the Council, at the request of Parliament, has included a fourth Community initiative which will also have very specific advantages for certain sections of the European Union's population, although it does not have the Community dimension that the other three initiatives have."
"We regret that the Berlin European Council agreed to significantly reduce the funding to be allocated both to the Structural Funds and to the Cohesion Fund, but we understand that these will be implemented in a positive manner over the next seven years."
"We also need to take account of the fact that the Structural Funds are practically the last to apply to the 15 Member States, since the prospect of enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe will change the regional action policies for years to come."
"I would finally like to thank the Commissioner for the efficient work she has done, which will ensure that the new regional policy for the 2000-2007 period will always be linked to her because of the enormous importance of her contribution."
"Mr President, after months of arduous debate and complicated negotiations, the time has come for the European Parliament to say yes or no to Agenda 2000."
"Personally, I am not going to say yes to Agenda 2000."
"My impression is that the agreement that has been reached is an agreement based not on the Union's needs but on the negotiation of national interests."
"That is the only explanation for the fact that the Commission's initial proposal was further diminished through the final agreement reached at the Berlin European Council, despite the fact that it already involved reducing the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund below their existing levels."
"For those of us who believe in a federal Europe based on social and economic cohesion, a golden opportunity has been lost to increase equality between the various regions of Europe."
"Furthermore, if we are getting involved in this idea of defending territorial interests, as the Berlin European Council did, I would still not be able to vote in favour of Agenda 2000. I was elected by the people of a specific European region - the region of Aragon - and this agreement would put the people I represent at a serious disadvantage compared with their current situation."
"Finally, I would point out that the agreement contains serious contradictions."
"To give you an example, Commissioner, one single problem - that of depopulation - is dealt with in three different ways in Agenda 2000. Firstly, the underpopulated regions of Northern Europe are granted Objective 1 status, that is, they have access to the main Structural Funds."
"Secondly, the Scottish Highlands are only granted special funding in the form of compensation. Finally - and this is the third way in which depopulation is tackled - other regions that suffer from the same problem, such as Aragon, are excluded from this aid altogether."
"A single problem cannot be dealt with in three different ways if we want Europe's structural policy to be consistent."
"As a result, I must say once again that I am not going to vote in favour of Agenda 2000."
"Thank you, Mr Escolá."
"Following that speech by Mr Escolá, ladies and gentlemen, we shall suspend the debate on Agenda 2000. It will be resumed this evening at 9 p.m."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is questions to the Council (B4-0337/99)."
"As the author is not present, Question No 1 lapses."
"Question No 2 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0324/99)"
"Subject: A fair trial for Öcalan In their statements on the Öcalan affair, all the European Union institutions have been unanimous in calling for a fair, open trial, in line with the conception prevailing in the legal systems of modern, civilized societies."
"However, the Turkish Government has so far rejected, in both words and deeds (obstructing the defence counsel, refusing requests for observers to attend the trial, etc.), all attempts to bring about a fair and open trial. Can the Council therefore state what steps it intends to take to ensure that the Kurdish leader does not suffer mental or physical harm and is guaranteed the right to defence, to which any person facing judicial charges in civilised societies is entitled as a matter of course?"
"I should like to welcome the President-in-Office and ask him to reply to Mr Alavanos's question."
"Mr President, let me answer this question as follows. The Council expects Turkey, like any other contracting party, to fully and entirely fulfil the obligations arising from the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment."
"Furthermore, the Council is assuming that Turkey will respect the right of any person facing judicial proceedings in Turkey, which therefore includes Mr Öcalan, to a fair trial and their right to defence, both of which are indeed also enshrined in the Turkish constitution."
"In its statement of 22 February 1999, the European Union took note of the Turkish Government's assurances to that effect."
"Mr President, the German Presidency has taken us somewhat by surprise, and I am ashamed at what I have just heard from the President-in-Office."
"At a time when Yugoslavia is being bombed we are indulging in 'savoir vivre ' with the Turkish Government, and the German Presidency is telling us that it has received assurances."
"All the Members here today have received an announcement from Amnesty International which states that Mr Öcalan's lawyers, Nyadji Bulgan and Irfan Didar, and others, have been tortured, and were attacked inside the court. Following that they were rounded up outside the court and beaten by the police."
"And the President-in-Office is indulging in 'savoir vivre ' with Turkey."
"I ask once again: are the European Union and indeed the German Presidency interested in human rights?"
"If so, how can the German Presidency not do anything, how can it remain silent and say such things as what it said in its answer about these despicable events taking place at the trial of Mr Öcalan?"
"Mr Alavanos, I reject quite categorically your attack on the presidency."
"You know the rules here."
"What I have to present is the common position that 15 Member States have formulated on your question."
"I cannot inform you of the German position as it is totally irrelevant."
"It is not a question here of the presidency's view but of what the Council says."
"That is what I have told you and I will repeat it: the Council expects and requires Turkey to comply with its national and international obligations, which arise from its own constitution and its accession to international conventions."
"Thank you, Mr Verheugen."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 3 to 11 will not be taken because they refer to subjects which are included on the agenda for this part-session."
"Mr Morris has the floor on a point of order."
"Mr President, my point of order is quite clear."
"As I have repeatedly said for many months now, and certainly this week, there is one issue the Council has refused to answer: whether or not depleted uranium munitions are being used in Serbia, Kosovo, what we previously knew as Yugoslavia."
"Mr Morris, please, just a moment."
"Mr Morris, under the Rules of Procedure questions on issues that are dealt with at another stage in the House are not included in Question Time."
"So I cannot give you the floor for that question."
"Mr Dimitrakopoulos wishes to speak, but I would like to know, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, which Rule you are invoking for your point of order."
"Mr President, I am sorry but I do not have the Rules of Procedure in front of me. However, as far as my point of order is concerned, I would simply like to know if we have abandoned the practice we were using up until now in Question Time whereby, following a Member's question and the Council's subsequent response, other Members had the right to put what is known in English as a 'follow up'."
"No."
"If you want to put a supplementary question to the question by Mr Alavanos, you have every right to do so."
"So let us return to Mr Alavanos' question."
"I have listened to the reply given by the President-in-Office. I have listened to the common position expressed by the 15 Member States, which is that the European Union expects Turkey to abide by the regulations in force concerning such serious issues."
"My question is this: if Turkey does not abide by them, what action is the European Union going to take?"
"Mr Dimitrakopoulos, it has been made clear to Turkey on many very recent occasions that its conduct in the Öcalan case, namely the guarantee of a constitutional trial, will affect the development of relations between the European Union and Turkey."
"If the Council concludes that Turkey is not fulfilling its obligations, it will take the appropriate steps."
"I cannot predict them today."
"But you can imagine what they would be."
"Question No 12 by Aline Pailler (H-0328/99)"
"Subject: Free movement of persons in the EU To prevent them from taking part in an (authorised) demonstration in Paris on Saturday, 27 March 1999, the French authorities closed the border to 3 000 Italians on the evening of 26 March, committing a serious abuse that infringed the right to demonstrate and freedom of movement within the Union."
"What steps will the Council take to avert similar actions in the future and guarantee that citizens may move freely within the EU?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mrs Pailler's question."
"Mrs Pailler, I am sorry to have to tell you that it is not within the Council's competence to judge how the Member States apply Community law; that is up to the Commission and the Member States concerned."
"At the time of the incident you describe in your question, the Schengen acquis had not yet been integrated into the framework of the European Union."
"Since it is a question here of relations between two Schengen partners, the admissibility of internal border controls comes under the Schengen implementing convention."
"Article 2(2) of that agreement provides that internal border controls can be carried out for a limited period purely for the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security."
"The state that orders these controls decides whether this may apply here."
"The entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty does not change this situation."
"Mr President-in-Office, each time we put questions to you here, you take refuge in regulatory issues, which I fully understand."
"Clearly, after two months, the Schengen provisions were not fully applied, but I feel that the Council's role is a political one."
"At a time when Europe is looking for its soul and the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, is telling us that we will find it in American culture, I wonder if we might not be able to generate a little enthusiasm among the people of Europe by allowing them to do something exciting that forms part of their culture, in other words, demonstrate solidarity in fighting for human rights across borders."
"I am therefore seeking a political response from you, Mr President-in-Office, given that you are a minister. And I would like to know if, in the Council of Ministers, when discussing immigrants, you talk not only about security problems - which you naturally discuss in great detail, as demonstrated on a daily basis by the Austrian and German Presidencies - but also about the fact that people, along with capital, have the right to free movement."
"Mrs Pailler, I have to tell you too that it is not a question of my personal view nor of the presidency's view."
"I can only give you an answer agreed by the two states concerned, which you mention in your question. Surely you can imagine the answer you would be given by the government concerned if you put the question to it in your national parliament."
"I cannot go any further than that."
"The Council is not competent in regard to your question."
"The Commission is responsible for compliance with Community law."
"I must ask you to put this question to the Commission."
"As for the matter of principle addressed in your question, I can tell you that the Council is looking closely at the problem of how Europe can be brought closer to our people, how they can be made more aware of the advantages Europe offers them and also how we can increase these advantages, especially in the field of internal and judicial policy which we are just discussing."
"Indeed we are already preparing a summit to be held in Finland in the autumn, which will be concerned with the further development of the People's Europe."
"But let me say again: individual cases such as this one do not come within the Council's remit."
"And the individual states would not tolerate any interference from the Council in the way they apply national or European law."
"Thank you, Mr Verheugen, but I must ask you to remain with this question as I have received requests for two supplementary questions."
"The first is by Mr Ripa di Meana, who has the floor for one minute."
"Mr President-in-Office, three thousand Italian citizens are being held up, under the pretext of various orders by the French police, at the frontier between Italy and France to stop them reaching a public, political and European meeting in Paris."
"The seriousness of this de facto suspension of the agreements on free movement of persons will naturally not escape you, but your prudence in matters of institutional powers - which I can understand - does not mean you can avoid a political response."
"Can the European Union tolerate three thousand citizens being prevented on alleged police grounds from exercising their full rights as European citizens?"
"I put that to you as a political question and I expect a political answer."
"Mr Ripa di Meana, I have to disappoint you too, however much you expect me as a politician to give a political answer."
"You know the rules of Question Time."
"I cannot give you a political answer off the cuff."
"I will have to discuss it first with the French and Italian Governments and with all the other 13 governments."
"After that you can have your political answer."
"All I can do here is point out to you that the French Government is basing its decision on Article 2(2) of the Schengen implementing convention."
"Naturally the French Republic, like any other member of Schengen, may carry out internal border controls for reasons of public law and order."
"Whether or not that was justified in this particular case is something I as a politician have a very definite view on."
"But I am not allowed to express it here."
"I have a question for the President-in-Office concerning Regulation No 1408/71."
"It is true that the European Union is in a difficult situation, since the Commission has been put out of action, so to speak, but clarification is needed of the proposal which has been put forward by the Commission regarding the amendment of Regulation No 1408."
"I would like to ask directly how the President-in-Office views the Danish early retirement benefit in relation to Regulation No 1408."
"Hitherto, the Danish early retirement benefit scheme has been kept out of the regulation, since it has been said not to be a social scheme, but an employment scheme."
"The fact is that the Danish Government has been given until the end of April to respond, and I would very much like to know when this question will come up in the Council."
"Mrs Jensen, I am rather at a loss."
"This was a supplementary to Mrs Pailler's question."
"That question referred to the fact that on the evening of 26 March the French authorities refused 3 000 Italian nationals entry into France."
"With the best will in the world I cannot see what bearing your question has on that incident."
"But I am quite prepared to answer it in writing."
"Question No 13 by Otto von Habsburg (H-0329/99)"
"Subject: Humanitarian aid to the needy in Ukraine It is reported by reliable sources that, in accordance with the so-called 'law on the protection of domestic commodity production', small packets containing food products, clothing or even medicines are being designated as 'agricultural products' and returned to senders."
"This impacts very harshly on the poorest people in the country, in particular those on old-age pensions, many of whom have to live on the equivalent of 37 to 50 German marks a month."
"Is the Council prepared to make representations to the Ukrainian government with a view to getting this policy reversed by reason of the humanitarian nature of these mailings?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr von Habsburg's question."
"Mr President, Mr von Habsburg, it is true that there were private initiatives until July/August last year to support needy Ukrainians by sending them parcels mainly containing food, medicines and clothing."
"Under presidential decree 738/98 of 4 July 1998 on imports of humanitarian aid from abroad, since that date only legal entities whose charitable status is established by law are recognised as recipients of duty-free imports of humanitarian aid, but not private individuals."
"Since then, packages of aid addressed to private individuals have been returned to the sender by the Ukrainian customs authorities, pursuant to Law 468/97 on the state regulation of imports of agricultural products into Ukraine."
"That law has been in force since 15 June 1998 and the presidency knows from own experience that this in fact also involves high costs for the senders of the packages."
"In the framework of bilateral talks, the German Government as the presidency has on numerous occasions urged, in fact insistently urged the Ukrainian Government to change these rules for humanitarian reasons, but unfortunately Ukraine has not responded at all to these efforts."
"The presidency will raise this matter in Brussels, at the second EU-Ukraine Cooperation Committee scheduled for July, after coordinating with its partners, especially Finland, and will make it an official subject of discussion between the EU and Ukraine."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Minister, I sincerely thank you for this clear, detailed and satisfactory answer to my question."
"It is a pleasure to see that this can sometimes happen during Question Time."
"Let me specifically ask you to make every effort in this matter."
"I receive a great many letters from Ukrainian pensioners who are in a really bad way and need help."
"If at all possible, I would ask you, Minister, to take very energetic steps to help them."
"After all they are our partners and will one day become our partners in the European Union."
"I would be most grateful if you could repeat and emphasise this need again."
"Thank you, Mr von Habsburg."
"I believe that this is your last question in Parliament and I must therefore thank you once again for your excellent speeches here during Question Time, and for your admirable brevity and respect for the time you are allocated."
"Mr President, Mr von Habsburg, I take what you have just said not so much as a question but more as words of encouragement, which I am happy to accept."
"I can assure you that we are keeping up constant pressure on Ukraine in relation to this matter."
"One reason I was able to answer the question was that I know from my own practical political experience that there are cases, especially the cases I am sure you know too, where it is possible to get round this law and what that costs those concerned."
"It really is hard to understand why someone who provides aid on an individual basis should incur costs that are many times higher than the value of the aid itself."
"Here I agree entirely with you and we will keep up the pressure on Ukraine in this respect."
"Mr President, Mr Medina Ortega, I really must admit that you are wasting no time in putting forward the interests of these regions here in Parliament, given that the Treaty has only been in force for four or five days."
"But basically that already answers your question, for pursuant to Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam the Commission must first make a proposal to that effect."
"Only when that proposal has been made can the Council take action and discuss specific measures for the outermost regions."
"But to date the Commission has made no such proposal."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his rapid and efficient response."
"In actual fact the Commission had said that it was going to draw up initial proposals this spring. Then, because of its resignation, it said that it was not going to do so until the autumn."
"However, from the point of view of a Member who, although representing all of Spain, represents the interests of the outermost regions in particular, it is important that the Council should take steps to enable the new Commission to consider this issue from the beginning, since the special scheme requires further development."
"Mr President, Mr Medina Ortega, it is with good reason that the rules of the European Union give the right of initiative to the Commission."
"The Commission is not here at the moment, but it will certainly defend that right tooth and nail."
"I would advise you to proceed as follows. A government with a particular interest in this matter could easily urge the Commission to submit a proposal to the Council as soon as possible and then I could assure you that the Council would consider the matter without any delay."
"Question No 16 by Hans Lindqvist (H-0341/99)"
"Subject: Safe food National campaigns on food safety and health are being conducted in all 15 Member States during the winter and spring."
"The original initiative was launched by the Commission's Directorate-General for consumer policy, DG XXIV, which is also financing the campaign."
"The EU has made some SEK 1.3 million available for the campaign."
"We in Sweden have recently had to fight hard to avoid the EU practice of regularly using antibiotics as additives in animal feed."
"Hitherto, Sweden has had strict rules on colouring in sweets, exacting standards of food quality control and stringent rules on crop spraying."
"Many EU rules are now forcing us to allow certain types of sweets despite their containing colouring that was previously banned in Sweden on public health grounds."
"Does public health not always take priority?"
"Should it not be the individual Member State's prerogative to decide what should be classified as safe or unsafe food?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Lindqvist's question."
"Mr Lindqvist, the Council attaches great importance to food safety, especially in relation to protecting the health of the consumer."
"The Luxembourg European Council expressed this same concern in its statement on food safety."
"In that statement it stresses that the production and marketing of safe food must be one of the European Union's priorities and that a high level of health protection must be ensured."
"As I just said in reply to your Spanish colleague's question, it is up to the Commission to submit proposals to the Council for initiatives in this area."
"For the rest let me say that if the Member States consider it necessary to maintain or introduce more stringent consumer protection measures than those that exist at Community level, they may do so pursuant to Article 129a of the EC Treaty - new Article 153 of the Amsterdam Treaty - provided such measures are compatible with the other provisions of this Treaty."
"If a Member State takes further-reaching measures of this kind, it must notify the Commission thereof."
"There are no further restrictions."
"I have tabled this question because my own country, Sweden, has quite strict food safety standards, both as regards home-produced and imported products."
"A number of decisions have now been taken in the EU which run counter to our interests."
"For instance, Sweden has been forced to follow the rules that apply to the Belgian Blue and to allow the species to be developed and also sold in Sweden."
"We have been forced to accept certain colouring agents in sweets and candies and in food products which could induce cancer and allergies, especially in children."
"Furthermore, meat contaminated with salmonella is crossing the border into Sweden."
"The question I should like to put to the Council is this: should it not be obvious that every Member State should be entitled, in the interests of protecting people's health, to draw up rules which apply not just to home-produced products but also to those which are imported?"
"If it is a question of changing the provisions of the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties, then are we prepared to do that in order to reinforce our environmental safeguards?"
"Of course I can confirm that, Mr Lindqvist."
"And I have already answered that question by pointing out that a Member State has the right to maintain or introduce more stringent consumer protection measures than those that exist at Community level."
"Naturally that includes measures such as those you mentioned."
"However, this must not create any barriers to trade or distortion of competition."
"Hence the rule that the Commission must be notified of any such measures so that it can examine that question."
"I am happy to read out the relevant passage from the Amsterdam Treaty again."
"It is the fifth paragraph of Article 153, former Article 129a, and it reads: 'Measures adopted pursuant to paragraph 4 shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures."
"Such measures must be compatible with this Treaty."
"The Commission shall be notified of them.' That is what I just explained to you."
"Compatibility with the Treaty relates to the question of barriers to trade and freedom of competition."
"With due respect, Mr President-in-Office, there really is something which you do not mention in your reply."
"It is true that a Member State can make use of a safeguard clause."
"This gives it six months in which to produce scientific evidence in order to maintain the more stringent basis which it requires in its own country."
"It is stated that this must not be a technical barrier to trade."
"You actually said that yourself in your reply."
"If it cannot be proved that there are grounds for the more stringent rules, then it will be regarded as a technical barrier to trade, and it is now expressly stated in the new environmental guarantee that if it can be proved that the tougher rule which is being sought at national level is actually in the consumers' interests, then the EU must adopt the regime."
"It is therefore not possible to maintain stricter rules unless evidence can be produced that they are necessary."
"In fact, Commissioner Bangemann also said this yesterday when we were discussing baby food."
"In some countries, things have been permitted because it has not been proved that a very small amount of pesticides in baby food is harmful, whereas other countries do not tolerate any pesticide residues at all."
"But Mr Bangemann stated categorically that he would not accept trade barriers."
"There should be clear scientific evidence on the table so that the Member States can maintain stricter rules."
"Mrs Sandbæk, we have a problem here."
"This is another question which seems out of context."
"I was asked about food safety and I did not say a word about the six-month period you cite."
"I know nothing about this six-month period; what I referred to was the Treaty provision on consumer protection."
"Your question relates to an environmental matter."
"That was not in the original question nor did I answer on the subject."
"If you have a question on the subject, I am sorry to say we did not receive it so I can only answer it in writing."
"Thank you, Mr Verheugen."
"I am sure that Mrs Sandbæk hopes you will fulfil your promise to answer her question in writing."
"Question No 17 by Arthur Newens (H-0343/99)"
"Subject: The EU/US banana dispute Would the Council make a statement about the latest information from the WTO Disputes Panel investigating the EU banana regime and about the response that it will make to the Panel's conclusions?"
"Mr Newens, first let me say that I hope this seemingly endless business is finally nearing its end now."
"At its meeting of 26 April 1999 the General Affairs Council emphasised that the European Union intends fully to respect the latest WTO ruling in the banana dispute and to amend the EU banana regime accordingly and without further ado."
"The Council therefore called on the Commission, in the light of further contacts with the USA and the other parties concerned, to submit proposals to amend the banana regime by the end of May 1999."
"Since we are not yet at the end of May, I am not in a position to tell you what form these proposals will take."
"Whilst thanking the President-in-Office for that reply, may I ask if it is envisaged that access for bananas from Lomé countries and the Canary Islands can still be adequately safeguarded, despite changes to bring the European Union's banana regime into conformity with the WTO ruling."
"Will the Council do everything possible to ensure this? - because it is crucial."
"Will not bananas otherwise constitute a precedent for other products of other less-developed countries to lose their outlets, and will that not raise, in the long term, the issue of amendments to the world trade system to protect the poor against the multinationals?"
"Mr Newens, with that question you have very accurately described the problem we are facing and that we have not managed to resolve so far."
"On the one hand we want to protect the banana producers with whom we have very close links; on the other hand, however, we have to respect the WTO rules."
"This dispute has now been going on for years and at some point one has to admit losing a dispute."
"The European Union has lost."
"It did not manage to win through here."
"The costs are quite considerable in any case, if you think of the punitive tariffs that have been imposed."
"Yet I am inclined to say that it is some satisfaction that the WTO has now markedly reduced the level of the punitive tariffs the USA may impose against the European Union."
"We are now paying 191.4 million dollars instead of the 520 million dollars the USA had originally fixed by unilateral procedure."
"We have to wait for the Commission proposal to see how the Commission manages to reconcile the two requirements you mentioned: protection of the producer, especially the poorer producer, and conformity with the WTO rules."
"I really cannot predict that today."
"Question No 18 by Anna Karamanou (H-0345/99)"
"Subject: Rising death toll and appalling living conditions in Iraq The President of the Medical Association for the Prevention of War, Mrs Sue Wareham, recently claimed that between 4 500 and 6 000 children are dying every month in Iraq of hunger and disease owing to the terrible shortage of food and medicines."
"The doctors stress that most deaths are caused by infections of the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems which, under normal circumstances, would be completely curable."
"Food and medicines are officially exempt from the sanctions imposed on Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait but the bureaucratic structure of the procurement system and the country's limited earnings from the legal sale of oil restrict imports."
"At the same time, the regime is exploiting the distress of the population as a weapon to have sanctions lifted completely with no concessions on its part."
"In what way will the Council intervene to ensure the effective protection of human rights in Iraq, in particular in the light of the UN Security Council's debate on the lifting of economic sanctions?"
"Mrs Karamanou, this is an extremely serious question and the Council is grateful to you for giving it an opportunity to address this issue in the European Parliament."
"The European Union is aware of the effects of the sanctions on the food situation and on health care in Iraq."
"The Council has for a long time been deeply concerned about the situation of the civilian population in Iraq and especially the children."
"That is why the Council has always supported the Security Council's offer, which Iraq initially turned down, to permit the sale of oil in return for humanitarian imports."
"Ever since the 'oil for food' programme was implemented in late 1996, the Member States of the European Union have chaired the Security Council's committee on sanctions against Iraq and always sought the flexible application and continual improvement of the programme."
"The European Union and its Member States are also playing their part in trying to improve the humanitarian situation in Iraq."
"But the crucial point of reference is and remains the 'oil for food' programme."
"At the 55th meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva from 22 to 30 April this year the European Union took the initiative in drafting a resolution on the human rights situation; this calls inter alia on the Iraqi leadership to cooperate further in carrying out the 'oil for food' programme and to ensure the fair distribution of the humanitarian imports."
"The Union also continues to support any initiatives to further improve the operation of the 'oil for food' programme and in this respect refers specifically to the proposals submitted by the UN Security Council panel on 30 March 1999 on the humanitarian situation in Iraq."
"While most of the initial administrative difficulties of the 'oil for food' programme have been ironed out, the main problem with the programme is now Iraq's poor export capacity and the distribution of the medical aid."
"Iraq's export capacity is now being improved under a sub-programme of the 'oil for food' programme, but it will not take full effect until spring 2000 because of the planning and delivery schedules; here, as you know, oil prices are a factor of uncertainty in both directions."
"According to information from the United Nations, medical aid to the value of 275 million dollars is currently blocked in Iraqi warehouses although it is urgently needed by the population."
"Responsibility for this lies with the Iraqi Government."
"That illustrates the point made in Mrs Karamanou's question that the Saddam Hussein regime is exploiting the distress of the population as a weapon to have sanctions lifted without fulfilling the cease-fire requirements of Resolution 687 of 1991."
"That means the Iraqi leadership is responsible for the inadequate implementation of the 'oil for food' programme, just as it is responsible for the fact that the sanctions still cannot be lifted after running for over eight years."
"Let me remind you that in 1991 all the experts could and did assume that Iraq could have complied with Resolution 687 on a basis of full cooperation within the space of a few months."
"We are dealing here with a conflict between the humanitarian principle and the principle of national sovereignty, both of which are enshrined in the United Nations Charter, which restricts our means of action."
"But let me leave you in no doubt that we can only condemn the conduct of the Iraqi state leadership as utterly inhumane."
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for your information."
"I would also like to congratulate the European Union on the initiatives it has taken and on the recent Geneva summit."
"However, I think we need to accept that America must change its Middle East policy."
"I would like you to tell me, Mr President-in-Office, whether the Council considers that the achievement of political and military objectives can ignore the cost in terms of human lives."
"I would also like your opinion on whether, in the case of Iraq, the Vienna Convention, which prohibits the starvation of citizens as an instrument of war, is not being violated?"
"Do you consider that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child are not being violated?"
"Six thousand innocent children are dying each month because of the embargo, and it is my conviction that no political objective can be placed above human lives."
"Because I believe that we are, quite rightly, in favour of protecting human rights, I would like to ask you whether the innocent population of Iraq does not come under the heading of people to whom protection of human rights applies."
"Finally, do you believe that this policy has weakened or, conversely, strengthened the position of Saddam Hussein, by analogy with what is happening in Kosovo and Serbia with regard to Mr Milosevic?"
"Mrs Karamanou, you are of course right to draw a parallel with the equally dreadful human rights situation in Kosovo, but in both cases we must after all look at cause and effect."
"In the case of Iraq it is clear that the sanctions were imposed on the basis of UN Security Council decisions."
"These sanctions were imposed because Iraq did not fulfil the necessary obligations for ensuring the security and stability of the region."
"But the programme I have described was permitted and was set in motion to ensure that these sanctions do not have the effect you described. I have also described the particular efforts being made by the European Union to ensure that this programme is effective."
"If it is not effective in certain areas, particularly in the area of medical care, the responsibility lies entirely with the Iraqi Government which has acted out of what are truly contemptible and base motives."
"Let me repeat: the Iraqi leadership wants to exploit this situation in order that the sanctions, which have a quite different political purpose, may be lifted."
"We must call on Iraq to fulfil its responsibility towards its own people."
"Does the President-in-Office accept that the 'oil for food' programme, while commendable, has many bureaucratic shortcomings and accompanying sanctions which still stop the needs of children from being met, while their parents can do very little to get rid of the inhuman dictatorship of Saddam Hussein."
"In these circumstances it really is not acceptable to justify the actions taken by the West by putting the blame just on Saddam Hussein - we all accept that."
"Something still has to be done and more has to be done to meet the needs of these children."
"Mr Newens, you are making a political statement here and all I can do is to respectfully take note of your opinion and to bring it up at the next Council meeting on the situation in Iraq."
"I take a different view from you, but that is not the point here."
"Your question made one point I want to address, the question of possible bureaucratic obstacles to implementing the humanitarian programme."
"I agree: they did exist, which is why we have begun to streamline this programme, although this has not produced satisfactory results to date."
"Question No 19 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0349/99)"
"Subject: Presidential elections in Algeria What political assessment does the Council make of the Algerian presidential elections of 15 April 1999?"
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, the European Union followed the presidential elections in Algeria with great attention and made a statement on them."
"It goes as follows. The election campaign raised considerable hope in Algeria and among its partners in the international community."
"By taking an active part in the election campaign, Algeria's citizens showed the store they set by a free, open, pluralist poll, as promised by the Algerian authorities."
"The European Union has noted the decision by six of the seven candidates to withdraw from the election and the reasons given by them for their decision."
"The European Union has supported and encouraged the democratisation process embarked upon in Algeria since 1995."
"The Union believes that it is by promoting democracy and the rule of law and by continuing with economic and social reforms that Algeria will be able to emerge from the crisis in which it has been embroiled for a number of years."
"The European Union will attach the greatest importance to initiatives along these lines by the new President-elect, Mr Abdelaziz Bouteflika."
"The European Union confirms its readiness to support the reform process in Algeria, particularly by way of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, and to continue the political dialogue entered into with the Algerian authorities."
"Mr President-in-Office, using the same constructive approach that seems to underlie your response, could you tell me what exactly the European Union will do to help put an end to the violence and what measures it will adopt to help combat corruption in Algeria?"
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, first of all I am glad that we obviously agree on the need to continue with the policy we have already begun vis-à-vis Algeria, regardless of what we think of what happened before the presidential election there."
"By saying regardless I mean that we must endeavour to support a process of democratisation in Algeria and after all the preconditions there for the democratisation process are better than in many other countries suffering from a democratic deficit."
"There are strong democratic forces in Algeria and there is also a very free press there, and one which indeed makes use of that freedom."
"We must also say that up to the time when the six candidates withdrew, the electoral campaign had actually suggested that Algeria was moving towards democracy."
"It was in fact the case that all the candidates could put forward their programme freely and without restraint and that the political debate in Algeria took place in the kind of constructive atmosphere not seen for a long time."
"We also took particular note of the fact that one of the key issues of this Algerian electoral campaign was national reconciliation."
"So we now conclude that in spite of the problem of which we are both aware, the movement towards a civil society in Algeria that began in the 1990s has in fact been boosted by the electoral campaign."
"I therefore think that we should do all we can in the form of political dialogue and political contacts to give further support to that process."
"In particular that means keeping in contact with the democratic forces in Algeria and supporting these forces, for instance by inviting them to the Member States of the European Union and to the European Parliament."
"It is important to demonstrate international protection and international support for the democratic forces in Algeria."
"Question No 20 by Eva Kjer Hansen (H-0351/99)"
"Subject: Appointment of officials without holding a competition In its answer to my question about the plans to appoint staff from the Schengen Secretariat, the Council stated that, under Article 7 of the Schengen Protocol annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty, it is obliged to take on the staff of the Schengen Secretariat since the Protocol has to be regarded as part of the Treaty and hence as part of primary Community law."
"However, Article 7 of the Schengen Protocol stipulates only that the Council must adopt the detailed arrangements for the integration of the Schengen Secretariat into the General Secretariat of the Council, i.e. the functions of the Schengen Secretariat and not necessarily its staff."
"To the extent that it is possible to envisage appointing existing Schengen Secretariat staff to the EU institutions, the provision in Article 7 of the Schengen Protocol in no way prevents the Council from appointing any staff interested in conformity with the existing rules of the Staff Regulations or from resorting to the alternative appointment procedure based on Article 24 of the Merger Treaty."
"This being so, can the Council explain why it in this case still considers it legitimate both to flout the current Staff Regulations and to ignore the Commission's right of initiative laid down in Article 24 of the Merger Treaty?"
"Mr President, pursuant to Article 7 of the Protocol annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty which integrates the Schengen acquis into the European Union, the Council decides by a qualified majority on the detailed arrangements for the integration of the Schengen Secretariat into the General Secretariat of the Council."
"On 1 May the Council took a decision laying down the details of the integration of the Schengen Secretariat into the General Secretariat on the basis of that Article 7."
"According to my information, this legal case will in fact very soon be brought before the European Court of Justice, which is why this is all I can say by way of an answer."
"I will not become involved in a legal debate because that is a matter reserved to the appropriate Community jurisdiction."
"This question is now purely a matter for the Court of Justice to decide."
"Let me however repeat that the Council's view is that the rules that have been adopted make every provision for guaranteeing the skills and competence of the individuals appointed."
"Given this situation and in view also of press reports that have also appeared today, let me point out that it is not the Secretary-General of the Council who is responsible for the tensions we are currently seeing in the General Secretariat, but that the only reason for these tensions is a political decision by the Council that is covered by the Treaty."
"To hold the Secretary-General responsible for that is, in my view, quite unfair and inappropriate in this situation."
"I would like to thank you for your reply, but I do not understand why the terms of the Staff Regulations are being disregarded, since there is after all nothing to prevent us from respecting the Council's existing rules during the integration process."
"There is no reason for us now to be recruiting large numbers of staff without them having to sit the recruitment tests, so I have still had no answer to my question as to why the existing rules are being disregarded."
"As far as I can see, this all smacks more of what one might call national nepotism, in other words that there are a number of Member States that wish to have some staff placed somewhere in particular, and the other Member States are therefore nodding this through."
"Can the President-in-Office tell me what justification there is for us now suddenly to start recruiting more staff than the 58 people who were originally deemed necessary?"
"It seems to me highly reprehensible that the Council is venturing to disregard the existing rules."
"Is it not the case, Mr President-in-Office, that there is a need to analyse the situation within the Council with a view to cleaning things up and clearly documenting what requirements - and what resources - there are for ensuring that we get more openness and more transparency with regard to what takes place within the Council, just as we are demanding within the Commission?"
"Mr President, Mrs Kjer Hansen, nothing is happening behind the scenes here; we are talking about an entirely open and public process."
"The Treaty provides that the Schengen Secretariat will be integrated into the General Secretariat of the Council and that the Council will decide the detailed arrangements."
"That is what the Council has done!"
"I have to say again that the political intention of the Treaty was to integrate the existing Schengen Secretariat - without any new appointments being made or any selection procedures being initiated - into the existing General Secretariat because surely there would be no point in the integration of one secretariat with another secretariat meaning that we appointed 80 new staff according to the rules that apply to the General Secretariat and kicked out the 80 people who used to work for the Schengen Secretariat."
"I cannot imagine that the questioner would agree to such an inhuman and unsocial solution."
"Nothing is being done behind the scenes here; it is a very normal, open procedure. And I must say in all honesty that the Council cannot understand the resistance the General Secretariat staff is showing here."
"Question No 21 by Pat Gallagher (H-0354/99)"
"Subject: Fishing fraud in southern Europe Is the Council aware of the Auditors' report criticising the Commission for failing to take adequate precautions to prevent fraud involving EU funds for modernising fishing vessels, most of which are located in southern Europe?"
"Is it aware that funds were given to renovate vessels that had already sunk or which would never be put in service again and that verification visits were minimal?"
"Will the Council now make a clear commitment that every effort will be made to recover or, if necessary, to impose severe penalties for proven embezzlement?"
"Mr President, I can only answer this question in the affirmative."
"The Council received the Court of Auditors' report on the formation of joint enterprises in the fisheries sector on 9 December 1998."
"The Council discussed the content of this report during the deliberations on the Commission proposal laying down detailed arrangements and conditions for Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector."
"This Commission proposal contains various provisions aimed at removing the abuses listed in the Court of Auditors' report on the management of joint enterprises."
"The presidency intends to take a final decision on this proposal at the Council of Fisheries Ministers in June, provided that Parliament has given its opinion by that date."
"Looking at the agenda, it would seem that Parliament will be discussing that proposal this week."
"I was deeply disappointed to learn from the Auditors' report that millions of pounds of taxpayers' money seem to have been siphoned off by boat owners in southern Europe."
"It appears that the Commission has failed to take the necessary precautions to prevent the alleged fraud."
"I understand that the missing funds were part of a EUR 280 million programme to modernise almost 200 fishing vessels."
"Grants were provided to refurbish and modernise boats which were expected to fish outside the Union."
"It is alleged that grants were paid to renovate vessels which were already sunk - grants were paid to renovate vessels that had little chance of going into active service."
"Indeed I understand that a grant was paid in respect of a fishing vessel that was submerged in the Atlantic off the coast of Portugal."
"Vessels were sunk under mysterious circumstances and rather than use the wide brush approach it is suggested that these were in Italy, Spain and Portugal."
"I want to raise this point with the Commissioner, while he is awaiting specific provisions to address the problems both at management and operational level."
"I presume I can accept that the presidency condemns such actions."
"I take no pleasure in raising this."
"All of us have to take some responsibility because if it is necessary to provide additional staff Parliament must approve additional monies."
"All of us are involved in this and if you require additional monies to overcome this problem then we must vote for them."
"Mr Gallagher, I have already told you that the Council has drawn the necessary political and organisational conclusions in the light of the findings of the Court of Auditors' report that you describe in such graphic detail."
"That is the Council's job and it has done it."
"The Council has to ensure that if problems of this kind arise measures are taken to prevent their recurrence."
"On the concrete question of what is being done to minimise in some way the damage that has occurred and of the European Union possibly also taking legal action, that is a question for the Commission and not the Council."
"I am of course assuming that the Commission will take these very serious criticisms in the Court of Auditors' report as grounds to pursue the European Union's interests as vigorously as possible."
"As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 22 and 23 lapse."
"Mr President, is it possible for Mr Fitzsimons and Mr Andrews, who are attending another meeting, to have written replies?"
"No, Mr Gallagher, they must be here themselves."
"If they had notified me in writing that you or another Member of the House were to act as a substitute for the questions, pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, then that would have been in order. However, in this case, the Rules limit answers in writing to those questions that we have not been able to cover during the hour and a half set aside for Question Time."
"Question No 24 by Liam Hyland (H-0360/99)"
"Subject: Backing a new LEADER III programme Will the Council outline its present policy with regard to the development of a fully integrated rural policy at EU level and will it give assurances that, as a part of such a policy, it will continue to support a new LEADER programme (III) and the retention of its name which is synonymous with empowerment and self-help and a positive image of the European Union?"
"Mr Hyland, the aim of the proposal in the agriculture section of Agenda 2000 for a regulation on rural development is to regenerate the rural areas and simplify the agriculture rules."
"The reform of the Structural Funds, which includes the agreed reduction of the number of Objectives from six to three, will make it easier to achieve this aim."
"This has already been discussed in depth here today."
"On that basis rural development policy can gradually establish itself as the second pillar of the common agricultural policy."
"In that context, the Leader Community initiative will be continued in the form of Leader III."
"Leader III aims to make rural development more dynamic overall by supporting the programme of innovative projects by local groups."
"Overlaps between Leader and measures under the rural development regulation will be prevented by the fact that the rural development regulation concerns national or regional support measures, but not local measures."
"Leader projects, by contrast, remain reserved to local action groups."
"Let me also point out that this question is a subject of the debate we have interrupted with Question Time."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"But I have to ask a supplementary question."
"Will LEADER retain its identity and independence as a Community initiative with a high level of voluntary Community participation?"
"Will the President-in-Office take steps to ensure that it is not absorbed into national or regional statutory structures but is seen by those agencies as an important but independent development programme?"
"A very important part of my question concerns the continuity of LEADER."
"We are anxious to ensure that there will be no delay between the ending of the present LEADER II and the beginning of LEADER III."
"Otherwise a lot of very professional staff who have been recruited over the years will be lost to the programme. This would be a very serious mistake to make."
"Mr Hyland, let me herewith give you the assurances you want in relation to all three parts of your supplementary."
"Question No 25 by Gerard Collins (H-0364/99)"
"Subject: Kuwaiti prisoners of war in Iraq Although nine years have passed since the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, the 598 Kuwaiti men and 7 women who were deported remain in Iraqi prisons."
"UN Security Council Resolution 687 called on Iraq to cooperate with the International Committee of the Red Cross in order to release these prisoners of war."
"Iraq has persistently obstructed the work of the ICRC by withholding information, failing to attend meetings and preventing the ICRC from inspecting Iraqi prisons."
"What steps has the Council taken to-date to alleviate the plight of the 605 Kuwaiti POWs and what intervention with the Iraqi authorities or other measures does it propose to take to address this humanitarian issue?"
"Mr Collins, the Council shares your concern about the problem of the disappeared persons, including the prisoners of war, who fell victim to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait."
"At the 55th meeting of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva from 22 March to 30 April 1999, the European Union submitted a draft resolution calling on Iraq to cooperate with the appropriate international organisations and to provide information on the whereabouts or fate of the remaining disappeared persons."
"We called for compensation to be paid to the families of those who have died in Iraqi prisons or have disappeared."
"All Kuwaitis or other nationals who are still in prison must be released at once."
"Families must be notified of the whereabouts of prisoners. We also call on Iraq to provide information on death sentences carried out on prisoners of war or civilian prisoners, including the death certificates of prisoners of war or civilian prisoners who have died."
"I do not think more can be done in this matter."
"You know as well as I that unfortunately we are not in a position to force Iraq to comply with these demands."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the President-in-Office for the information he has given."
"It all boils down to the fact that other than putting forward a draft resolution at the 55th human rights meeting in Geneva, where we stated our position, we have done nothing else since because we have no information whatsoever with regard to the 598 Kuwaiti men and seven women who were sent to Iraqi prisons."
"Is there any further pressure that the Council and the European Union would consider putting on the Iraqi authorities in an effort at least to get information as to how many of these people are alive, who they are, what is the state of their health, when they are going to be released and, indeed, how many have died."
"Can we do anything in a positive way at this particular time nine years later?"
"Mr Collins, I will not conceal from you that I am very pessimistic about this."
"Efforts have been going on for a long time now and the European Union has stepped them up."
"In my answer I did not even list all the initiatives we have already taken."
"There are a number of others."
"There is also a new initiative by the United Nations Security Council."
"The situation remains unchanged and I cannot see what other means of pressure we can apply against a country on which we have already imposed the most far-reaching sanctions at our disposal."
"Question No 26 by Per Gahrton (H-0365/99)"
"Subject: Interpretation in Council The TT news agency reported on 30 March 1999 that, in three cases out of four, Swedish representatives in the Council are compelled to negotiate in a foreign language during Council meetings."
"According to the report, interpretation in English, German and French is almost standard."
"To express oneself in a language other than one's mother tongue must be regarded as a distinct disadvantage in negotiations."
"Can the Council, therefore, confirm or deny these reports and say whether it will take measures to ensure that Swedish is treated in the same way as the major languages in the EU and that Swedish representatives are able to express themselves in Swedish and rely on being interpreted in the future?"
"Mr President, Mr Gahrton, the Council is aware of the news agency report you quote."
"Unfortunately that report about Council meetings and Swedish interpreters is undated and provides no further details."
"Given the almost countless number of Council bodies that have met on such countless occasions recently, with the best will in the world the presidency has been unable to find out which Council meetings and which dates are being referred to."
"So we have not been able to look into the actual incidents in question."
"In regard to interpretation from Swedish in principle, let me say that a Council programme exists, and has also been forwarded to the Swedish Government, on the appointment and training of interpreters in the Swedish language and that this programme is now under way."
"Thank you for your reply, even though it was not really much of an answer."
"I mentioned in my question that the report had come from the Swedish news agency, TT, on 30 March this year."
"I assume that what they refer to must have taken place a relatively short time before."
"However, the question was not about a particular occurrence, but a generally held view that all too often no provision is made for the Swedish language when Swedish representatives are taking part in Council meetings."
"It is therefore extraordinary that the Council should not be more aware of a situation which has provoked quite an intense debate in Sweden."
"Indeed, I think one might have been better informed before coming here to answer questions."
"In any event, for one of the Member States it is a most important question."
"Suspicion is already rife that there are plans to do away with the minority languages altogether in the EU context."
"It would therefore be helpful if the Council could give a more positive assurance that, in its own work, it is not the case that it is systematically endeavouring to screen out the minority languages and taking advantage of the fact that some of the Swedish representatives are probably able to express themselves in another language."
"Mr President, Mr Gahrton, all I can tell you is that I myself have never attended a Council meeting at which Swedish was not interpreted from start to finish."
"If you have information to the effect that this is not the case, I would be grateful if you could pass it on to me."
"The presidency of the Council does not have such information and we did look into the press report you cite but were unable to find out when and where this is supposed to have happened."
"Nor does the presidency have any kind of complaint before it from Sweden that its language is neglected at Council meetings. May I perhaps advise you not necessarily to rely on an anonymous press agency report but to accept the official statement the Council presidency is giving you here."
"So if you do have information, I would be grateful if you could pass it on and then we would look into the matter."
"The principle of course applies that no Member State may be placed at a disadvantage by negotiations not being interpreted in its language."
"As the author is not present, Question No 27 lapses."
"Question No 28 by Marianne Eriksson (H-0368/99)"
"Subject: Commissioner for equality In accordance with Articles 2, 3 137(1) and 141 of the Amsterdam Treaty, the EU is to take up equality between the sexes as an extremely serious issue."
"There are many, in fact, who say that this matter should be given top priority."
"In the light of these considerations, will the Council say how it envisages achieving an even distribution of the sexes among the future Commissioners and what its views are on appointing a Commissioner solely responsible for equality?"
"Mrs Eriksson, let me first emphasise that the Council attaches very great importance to measures to promote equal opportunities for men and women and to the practical implementation of the appropriate provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty, which applies to all the bodies, organs and institutions we have in Europe, from the European Parliament to the Commission and to the Council itself. But I am sorry to have to point out that the Member States are solely responsible for proposing the members of the European Commission pursuant to the provisions of the Treaties and that the distribution of tasks within the Commission is in fact an internal Commission matter."
"The Council has no part whatsoever to play in this connection, and I am not even saying: 'unfortunately no part whatsoever'."
"The Commission's sovereign right to organise its own affairs is an important aspect of integration policy in the Union and we should not jeopardise it by prescribing to the Commission from the outside how it should organise itself."
"In spite of everything, I find it rather depressing, at this last part-session of Parliament, to have to witness such a passive approach to coordination, something which the Council is otherwise glad to recommend."
"I am definitely not satisfied with the answer."
"In my view, after all the criticism which has been levelled at the lack of progress in promoting equality of opportunity between men and women, the Council should be more active in initiating discussions and ensuring that there are more than the three, or possibly four, women candidates currently rumoured to be in the running."
"It is a frightening thought, given that we are about to enter the new millennium, which everyone says should herald something genuinely new, that we are still being confronted with something old."
"I also expected to hear whether there had been any discussion of what should now be done to give genuinely active encouragement to equality of opportunity following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, Article 13 of which covers all groups, including women, in terms of anti-discrimination."
"Mrs Eriksson, I quite understand your strong feelings and your comment, but the Council will not be tempted even by Members of the European Parliament to infringe the Treaties."
"The Treaties are quite unambiguous here."
"The Council does not have the right to exert any influence on this question."
"Mr President, the State Secretary, Mr Verheugen, is behaving like a true diplomat: he avoids the issue that the President-in-Office is clearly in a position to negotiate with Member States on the matter of the balanced appointment of male and female candidates to the Commission."
"Mr Verheugen, you may have noticed that on 23 March the European Parliament indicated its desire for a substantially greater proportion of women Members of the next Commission than there is at present."
"I would like to ask you this: will you in no way take responsibility for this?"
"You are perfectly capable of promoting this aim in negotiations with the Member States."
"The Commission's new President, Mr Prodi, has already discovered that we in the House are quite serious about this."
"Today, in a press conference, he stated he was giving this issue his attention."
"You could work in cooperation with him."
"But is it your intention to negotiate with the Member States?"
"Mrs Hautala, you must have misunderstood me if you say my answer was diplomatic."
"It was meant to be anything but diplomatic."
"I wanted to make it clear that however noble and right a political concern may be, the Council cannot assume powers that it does not have."
"The same applies to the presidency."
"The situation is not what you think."
"The presidency does not have the power to negotiate with the Member States about who they send to Brussels as a member of the Commission."
"The President of the Commission whose appointment you confirmed today has that power, and that President of the Commission, who was also selected on the basis of whether he can effectively assert the rights that he has, is pursuing the aim to which you referred."
"The presidency also has great sympathy for that aim, but unfortunately there is nothing at all it can do about it."
"Since the office of presidency is filled by a country that can appoint two Commissioners, it can only ensure that the principle you called for is observed by its own country."
"But unfortunately I have no means of doing the same for Sweden because Sweden only appoints one Commissioner, which means it is rather difficult to apply the quota system in this case."
"Question No 29 by Jonas Sjöstedt (H-0369/99)"
"Subject: Protection of persons providing information Before the Commission resigned, Paul van Buitenen, the internal auditor, was suspended from duty on half pay."
"Since then, he has obtained a new post in another Commission department."
"This and similar cases raise the question of the need to allow Commission staff the freedom to provide information, which in Sweden, for example, is a right enshrined in the constitution."
"Does the Council consider that the right of Commission staff to provide information should now be a matter for debate in the light of events prior to the Commission's resignation?"
"I am a little confused, Mr President."
"Are we talking about Mr van Buitenen?"
"Is that the question?"
"This is Question No 29 on protection of persons providing information."
"But yes indeed, Mr Sjöstedt is referring to Mr Paul van Buitenen."
"In reply to Mr Sjöstedt's question, let me emphasise that the internal organisation of the Commission is the affair of that institution alone."
"As for the Council, it has never had call to act in the kind of situation addressed by the questioner."
"On the contrary, in what are fortunately rare cases, the Council's administration has felt obliged to take strong action against officials who have not respected the necessary professional rules of conduct in the course of their duties."
"I should like to thank the Council for its answer."
"To my mind, the right of officials to denounce and publicly criticise irregularities is not an internal matter of staff regulations and so on, but is in fact a fundamental question of openness."
"There is soon to be a new intergovernmental conference which will provide opportunities for further strengthening openness within the Union, a process that has already begun with the formulation of rules on access to documents."
"One such possibility would of course be to strengthen the right of employees to denounce irregularities and express criticism without being silenced or actively penalised, as was the case in the Commission."
"I should be glad to hear the Council's views on this, in other words whether openness can be further developed in the European Union."
"The Council cannot make any statement about the internal organisation of the Commission."
"That is the Commission's own business."
"The Council could give its view if this incident had concerned its own staff."
"But that is not the case."
"No such problem has arisen within the Council."
"Nor can I make any judgment because obviously the personal files or disciplinary measures relating to Commission staff are not available to the Council."
"It is quite impossible for me to judge what actually happened in this case."
"You will have to address this question to the Commission."
"And indeed you can easily do so."
"The Council cannot make any comment."
"Thank you, Mr Verheugen."
"I hope that Parliament and the Council are now back on the same wavelength, since I would now invite you to reply to Question No 30."
"Question No 30 by Bernd Posselt (H-0372/99)"
"Subject: Agreement with Croatia Given that Croatia's economy and tourist industry have been substantially damaged by the military activity in the vicinity and that the country has also been militarily threatened, the conclusion of a trade and cooperation agreement with Croatia would considerably help to stabilise the entire area."
"What is the current position as regards granting a negotiating mandate to the Commission?"
"Mr President, regarding the possible upgrading of contractual relations between the European Union and Croatia, I believe the honourable Member is aware that this comes under the EU's regional approach, as set out in the General Affairs Council's conclusions of 29 April 1997."
"Twice a year the Council examines whether the requirements set in that respect have been fulfilled."
"After its last examination on the basis of the conditions set on 9 November 1998, the Council decided that Croatia should continue to be granted autonomous trade preferences but that the conditions for assistance under the PHARE programme had not been met and that it was also too soon to negotiate a trade and cooperation agreement."
"Any improvement in relations, including possible future negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement, will depend on whether Croatia makes further progress towards meeting the required conditions."
"At this moment I cannot foresee when the fulfilment of these conditions will next be checked."
"In regard to your broader question about the general stability of the region, on 26/27 April 1999 the Council agreed to begin preparing a stability pact for south-eastern Europe."
"The EU is vigorously pursuing this task."
"It is doing so in cooperation with the appropriate international organisations and regional initiatives and in particular with the states of that region, with the initial aim of holding a conference on the stability pact for south-eastern Europe at senior official level; this will be convened by the presidency of the European Union in Bonn on 27 May 1999."
"The stability pact will offer all the Balkan states a concrete prospect of stability and integration into the Euro-Atlantic structures."
"I myself will be in Croatia next week as the representative of the presidency to discuss the development of relations between the EU and Croatia with the Croatian Government, the Croatian Parliament and Croatian political parties."
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for that very detailed and informative reply."
"Yet I do have a supplementary."
"You said that a decision was taken on 9 November during the bi-annual consideration of the question."
"If my calculations are right, six months have elapsed since then but you said you could not foresee when the next six-monthly check would take place."
"So I just wanted to ask: have I misunderstood something or has the timetable changed in some way?"
"I also wanted to ask another question. Serious events have occurred since 9 November, namely the war in Kosovo, which after all has radically changed things."
"I do agree that Croatia must fulfil certain conditions - and indeed it has already fulfilled many of them, while there are others that it has not - but I see no reason to place Croatia in a worse contractual position than, for instance, Albania or Macedonia, which are also politically very unstable and problematic countries, while Croatia is after all an emerging democracy."
"That is my view but my actual question is this: when will the next decisions be taken?"
"Mr Posselt, in reply to your supplementary I have to say that the Commission is indeed running late."
"I shall take your question as an opportunity to urge the Commission to keep to the six-monthly date."
"On your second question, the purpose of my trip to Croatia is precisely to find out whether what you say is true."
"I am quite prepared to notify you of the results of the talks in Zagreb directly and in confidence."
"As the author is not present, Question No 31 lapses."
"I should now like to appeal to your generosity, Mr President-in-Office."
"At the last part-session, you asked if we could finish ten minutes early."
"I would now ask you to finish one minute late, and to give your last answer for today and for this German Presidency to Question No 32."
"Question No 32 by Brian Crowley (H-0377/99)"
"Subject: Earmarking 1 % of the ESF for a social capital fund In the context of the reform of the Structural Funds, will the Council give assurances that the Commission's proposal to earmark 1 % of the ESF for a social capital fund will be maintained given its importance in providing fast-track access to ESF support for NGOs and taking into account also the positive experience of this type of scheme under the 'Peace and Reconciliation Programme' in Northern Ireland?"
"Mr President, we have had the same problem all evening."
"I have totally different numbers from you."
"That is what makes matters so difficult."
"But I have now found the question, because Mr Brian Crowley's name is on it."
"Mr Crowley, in reply to your question, let me refer you to the Council's common position as adopted on 14 April and forwarded to the European Parliament that same day."
"In it, the Council stated that it was against earmarking a minimum amount of 1 % of ESF resources for fairly small subsidies to non-governmental organisations."
"The Council regarded the Commission proposal to that effect as too inflexible and replaced the 1 % by what it referred to as an appropriate amount."
"However, the Council intends to amend its common position and to provide for a possible 100 % cofinancing of these subsidies."
"That would create an incentive for using European Social Fund appropriations for subsidies to non-governmental organisations."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his response."
"However it is with some concern that I see that they have changed the common position in particular."
"The reason why we looked for the 1 % of the ESF to be ringfenced for these kind of actions is that we were afraid that if it were left for the Council to decide, no money would be made available to the NGOs and for these other actions."
"We are working exclusively from the experience which we already have from the peace and reconciliation programme in Northern Ireland, also from some of the environmental programmes which have been so successful where the NGOs have taken the lead and been given assistance from European Union funding."
"We are afraid that these monies will be denied to them in the future."
"Could we have a guarantee from the President-in-Office that, whilst they may not agree with the ringfencing of 1 %, they will give a definite commitment that there will be a percentage available when the new ESF operation comes into being?"
"Mr Crowley, obviously I cannot give you that commitment."
"And you know that, because it would mean suspending the existing Council decision."
"I am quite prepared to put your arguments to the Council again and to reconsider them."
"But let me tell you that I do not agree with your assessment of the matter."
"I think the formula the Council has opted for tends to increase rather than reduce the possibilities of the funding you call for."
"Thank you, Mr Verheugen."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached the end of the time set aside for questions to the Council. Questions Nos 33 to 39 will receive written answers."
"Those are the last questions to the Council for this parliamentary term, and to Mr Verheugen, whom we thank for his cooperation."
"Despite our occasional lack of coordination, there has always been a willingness to work together."
"We give him our best wishes."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The sitting was suspended at 7.07 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m."
"Agenda 2000 (continuation)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am pleased to be taking part this evening in the final debate of this House on the Agenda 2000 reform project."
"Both the rapporteurs and the Commissioner delivered their opinions this afternoon. Ladies and gentlemen, you will continue the debate this evening with a general discussion."
"The European Parliament's political discussions on Agenda 2000 will then come to a close with tomorrow's vote."
"The conclusion will be, as it were, a tailor-made one because by approving the Agenda 2000 proposals the European Parliament is laying the foundations, during the final part-session of both this parliamentary term and the German Presidency, for the future development of the European Union and not least the future common agricultural policy."
"However, this decision will also bring to an end a discussion which has occupied both politicians and professional groups in all the Member States for two years."
"Since the Commission presented its statement entitled 'Agenda 2000 - a stronger and wider Union' in spring 1997, an all-out effort has been made to change the direction of the common agricultural policy."
"I should like to point out in particular that the European Parliament has made its position on this absolutely clear from the outset."
"It has claimed a constructive role in the process through the resolutions it has adopted and, in particular, by taking up positions of substance."
"When you deliver your opinion tomorrow on the decisions of both the agricultural ministers and the Heads of State and Government, you will be adopting a reform which clearly bears the European Parliament's mark as well."
"Even though many people would have wished for more far-reaching decisions in one area or another, we should perhaps accept that this reform meets the demands made on it."
"I will mention four main areas."
"A maximum of EUR 297 billion will be made available for the agricultural budget during the period 2000-2006."
"Agricultural expenditure in real terms will therefore still be limited to the present level."
"The reform of the common agricultural policy and pre-accession aid also prepare the Community for enlargement eastward in the agricultural sector."
"The common agricultural policy's stronger orientation towards the market and the environment will equip the Community with an offensive negotiating strategy at the forthcoming round of WTO negotiations."
"It can also use this to defend the European model of agriculture with its high standards of quality, safety and protection."
"Measures to promote rural development have been extended considerably and can now be developed into a second pillar of the common agricultural policy."
"In view of the complexity of the subject matter and the obvious conflicts of interest in this area between the Member States as well, I think it was not to be taken for granted that the negotiations on the agricultural part of Agenda 2000 would be concluded successfully."
"It is the result of hard work, but I think it is first and foremost the result of the exemplary form of cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council which was based on trust and was always constructive."
"It has also been a matter of concern for me from the outset to promote the dialogue between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"Perhaps you will agree with me that in the informal conciliation procedure we have developed an instrument which in the past few months has proved to be exemplary."
"In addition to the procedure laid down in the Treaty, information has been exchanged on a regular basis, allowing you, ladies and gentlemen, to be kept up to date on the Council's views."
"The agricultural ministers have also been kept fully informed of your opinions."
"In particular, I would add that, as President-in-Office of the Council, the position of the European Parliament was always a very useful trump card when seeking solutions during the negotiations."
"We have reached the end of a long and - we should not conceal this fact - sometimes difficult journey."
"I believe that we have taken a decision to the best of our knowledge and beliefs which should be of use to Europe and its citizens."
"This is definitely a joint project, and I hope very much that it will also be a joint success."
"May I thank you all for your support and trust in me."
"I am thinking particularly of Mr Fischler here, and the contribution he made during the negotiations."
"I should like to stress this point."
"This kind of cooperation based on trust has been most gratifying, even though it took up a great deal of our time, sometimes into the night."
"I also thank all those who participated."
"In spite of all the controversy which we dealt with, it was always clear that there was a joint effort to make decisions."
"In particular, the way in which we argued with each other in order to make these decisions speaks for itself."
"I think it was described by everyone as appropriate and friendly. I sensed this from the reactions of various people who participated in the project too."
"It is not for the Chair to make comments on the substance of what you have said, but I believe that the Chair has a duty to thank you and your colleagues in the German Presidency. You have always shown respect and a willingness to cooperate, and your presence in this Chamber has always left a strong impression."
"We acknowledge this, and would like to thank you for all you have done."
"Mr President, the implementation of the Berlin agreements will mean that the process of farms disappearing and jobs being destroyed, which already started with the 1992 reform, will become more pronounced."
"In addition, this process will largely affect small and medium-sized farms, as they will be only partially compensated through income aid."
"Furthermore - and this is the worst element, in my group's view - no means of correcting the existing imbalances between continental and Mediterranean production and between small and large farms has been introduced."
"The financial allocations for continental production are being increased again, while those for Mediterranean production remain frozen."
"The scheme approved in Berlin will also have a severe negative impact on the social fabric of the countryside."
"Do the Commission and the Council really expect the timid rural development measures to compensate for that impact?"
"The rural development measures proposed are going to be implemented to give preferential treatment to the richer Member States that have a smaller percentage of farmers."
"In addition, the Commission's proposal will exclude fruit and vegetable growers from the benefits of the rural development measures."
"I am absolutely astonished that Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development rejected an amendment tabled by my group to correct this situation and that the amendment was declared inadmissible in the House pursuant to Rule 60 of the Rules of Procedure."
"It is just as well that, in this case, the Berlin European Council did intend to correct that point, highlighting the paradox of what happened in Parliament's Committee on Agriculture."
"There have been CAP reforms since 1992 intended, presumably, to correct the uneven economic support granted to small and large farms."
"In the wake of the Commission's timid proposal, the Berlin agreements are a step backwards in terms of limiting aid to large farms and increasing support to small and medium-sized farms."
"The Committee on Agriculture's position represents no progress in that direction either, and I must say once again that it is unfortunate that an amendment by my group on modifications to the aid was declared inadmissible."
"As a result, my political group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, will not support a reform of the CAP which will actually mean that its main imbalances will become more marked."
"Mr President, this concluding debate on Agenda 2000 should be limited to the main thrust of the reforms."
"If we now try to bring controversial amendments we risk bringing down the whole Berlin package like a house of cards."
"I am thinking, for example, of the amendment in the Görlach report to increase setting-up aid from EUR 25 000 to EUR 35 000."
"A number of Member States simply cannot accept such cost-increasing proposals."
"The central question today is: do we accept the financial basis of Agenda 2000 and are we going to confirm this in an interinstitutional agreement?"
"My answer is a straightforward 'Yes'."
"If the Union wants to give applicant countries the real prospect of accession we must look at how this is to be financed."
"The financial perspective agreed in Berlin is essential for this."
"The Council has succeeded in drawing up an efficient multiannual budget, thus creating the financial scope for enlargement."
"I do, however, have great difficulty with certain elements of the package, such as the Council's unfortunate insistence that the ceiling on structural expenditure must also be a target."
"But all things considered, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages."
"I do not believe that recourse to Article 203 of the Treaty, which is what many Members of Parliament were calling for, is the right way forward, since it would result in an increase in the Union's expenditure which net contributors in particular would find unacceptable."
"My principal objection to the use of Article 203 is, however, that it would effectively mean making the financing of enlargement dependent upon the uncertain outcomes of the annual budgetary conflicts between the Council and European Parliament."
"This is completely unacceptable."
"Mr President, before this Parliament is dissolved it will have succeeded in expressing its opinion on the launch of the Structural Funds reform."
"It will have succeeded in moving forward from positions which threatened to produce yet another trial of strength between the European institutions."
"After repeated misunderstandings with the Commission on the progress of the work, which threatened to discredit the efforts being made, we are finally together not only on the texts of the new regulations but on a starting point for active collaboration in the management of the Funds through the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament on the implementation of the structural policies."
"Parliament has had an important voice in defining the guidelines for this reform, but it must have an even more important one throughout the programming period."
"We are glad the Council accepted Parliament's request to restore URBAN as one of the Community initiatives, albeit at the end of the negotiations."
"That was not obstinacy on our part as Members of Parliament, it was simply recognising the key role of urban areas in regional development."
"The balanced and complementary development of urban and rural areas is essential for economic and regional development."
"This means intensifying cooperation at all levels with the regional and local authorities and socio-economic operators closest to the evolving situation in the region."
"Greater competitiveness between regions must take account of the risks of imbalance caused by the differences in levels of employment and human resources, in infrastructure quality, in the natural environment and in development, especially in the delicate phase we are now entering with the identification of regions eligible for Objective 2."
"We are in favour of reform, generally speaking, but we do have certain reservations about grey areas not yet examined in depth - for example, the impact on the regions whose development process will be put on hold for the sake of the principle of concentration."
"The people of these areas will be penalised, and that hardly helps to demonstrate that the European Union is working for the development of the less-favoured regions."
"Actually my own country, Italy, is likely to be seriously penalised by the calculation of the Objective 2 ceiling: added to the guaranteed maximum reduction of 33 % there is the reduction caused by the inclusion of the regions coming out of Objective 1."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by saying how concerned I am that it looks as if major efforts are being made to ensure that the financial perspective can be approved tomorrow by Parliament without a qualified majority."
"I hope that that does not prove to be the case because it would be an inadequate end to a subject as important as the one we are debating this evening."
"The problem is that we are debating 'how' and 'how much' at the same time."
"And we may agree on 'how' but not on 'how much'."
"Yet tonight we have to decide on both aspects at once."
"I agree with the 'how', exactly as planned by the Commissioner, and I would also like to take this opportunity once again to congratulate the Commissioner and DG XVI. We have worked closely with her and she has helped us immensely in moving cohesion forward during these past five years and, I believe, also for the years ahead."
"I agree with the report by Mr Hatzidakis and Mrs McCarthy in relation to Objective 1, coordination and partnership projects, and so on. So Mrs Wulf-Mathies and Mr Eneko Landaburu have not only the support, but also the appreciation of the parliamentary committee that has worked with them on these issues."
"But we are entering an era where the European Union has more powers."
"It has a codecision procedure, a single currency and a single market, and we want improved cohesion and a worthy enlargement."
"We want social policies, policies on employment, on rural development and on trans-European networks."
"And what does the Council offer us in its Berlin negotiations?"
"It offers us a move from that mythical figure of 1.27 % - which was so difficult to get past - to 0.97 %."
"It offers us a reduction and a de facto renationalisation of the funds the European Union needs, and I have to say that quite a few Members will say 'no' to the Council tomorrow, precisely on the issue of the financial perspective."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, in Parliament's view the decision-making procedure for Agenda 2000 deserves to be praised and to be met with approval."
"In view of the timetable for ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty, the Council and the Commission have already agreed that as far as possible, the European Parliament should be granted those rights to which it has only formally been entitled since 1 May this year, particularly in the area of structural reform."
"As the European Parliament and perhaps also as representatives of the Member States, we can agree under these circumstances, and with a clear conscience, to the results of Agenda 2000 and the decision-making procedure regarding this."
"The most important objectives which the Commission had already envisaged are entirely reasonable."
"Concentrating on the real problems and problem areas, less bureaucratic structures, and greater efficiency and transparency generally make good sense."
"If other important practical, national and regional concerns have been dealt with in addition to this, the matter is a really coherent one."
"In this respect, as a representative of my country, I welcome the special consideration given to rural development under the new Objective 2."
"I also approve of the new phasing-out regulation for former Objective 1, 2 and 5b regions where regeneration has almost been achieved but a little bit more is needed."
"I welcome the new Interreg regulation in particular, because we have worked long and hard on it, and I hope in particular that the regions bordering with the applicant countries at the EU's external borders will take advantage of the time and money available."
"At any rate, for Austria this amounts to ATS 5 billion over the next seven years."
"My enthusiasm for Agenda 2000 is limited on one decisive issue."
"Is it really justifiable to celebrate the fact that we all want Europe to cost us less in the future as one of the most successful conclusions of Berlin at a time when we are all rightly calling for more European integration in employment, structural reform in general, the EU enlargement process, and solidarity for the wider Europe?"
"Is 1 % of Europe's gross domestic product really too much for the Member States to pay when national quotas are 40 % or more?"
"I do not think so!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to express my appreciation for the fact that so many Commissioners are still present at this late hour."
"I see this as a sign of esteem for the European Parliament, as also is the presence of German Minister Funke."
"This too should be acknowledged."
"It shows that you are ready to listen, at whatever hour Parliament calls its speakers."
"Mr Flynn, you naturally called for support for the proposals to reform the European Social Fund."
"My group will certainly be doing so, and will also be supporting Mrs Jöns's proposals."
"When it comes to employment and job creation we must all join together to do the best we can."
"But at the same time we cannot deny that a large group in society is in need of special attention, and by this I mean people in a disadvantaged position, such as women and minorities."
"This is expressed in Parliament's amendments, and it was particularly the Council that was not too keen on it."
"I hope that we can work together to achieve further progress in this area."
"This brings me to something which is very close to my heart: the European Social Fund and also, Mr Fischler, the new budget for rural development."
"I very much welcome them both."
"I believe the European Social Fund is a means of giving impetus to job creation in Europe, just as the fund for rural development is something which should facilitate the major changes which large sections of the farming sector have to make."
"Of course it is also the case that the resources for rural development are insufficient."
"My fear, Mr Funke, is that when it comes to implementation the Member States will look primarily to their own interests."
"I very much fear that alongside these very welcome budgetary headings that we have agreed a number of other things will creep in which we most certainly do not want to encourage."
"The first thing that could creep in is that Member States will seek to use European money to solve their own problems."
"If that happens, the people will rightly say that we are just dishing out money."
"The second thing we must carefully guard against is the consultancies and other intermediaries walking away with the funds made available to introduce these changes."
"I believe European-level management and monitoring in this area to be one of the most important tasks for the future."
"We will have no credibility in the eyes of the people of Europe if on the one hand we say we want to exercise control over a number of problems and will make money available to do it, and then allow that money to disappear into the pockets of organisations and individuals who are not entitled to it."
"This may be my last speech as although I am eligible for re-election my party is not doing so well. My final appeal to the Commission is therefore to pay careful attention to this, and if I am not re-elected I hope that I can read in the newspaper that you have received the message."
"If I am re-elected, I will most certainly ensure that this happens."
"Mr President, I really must like farming and be used to the sacrifices it demands of us to come here at this hour to speak for just two minutes."
"But it is a great pleasure for me to do this, given that we are talking about an important measure, that is Agenda 2000, which deals with some extremely complex aspects of the European farming world."
"I do not know exactly what the European agricultural model is, nor does anyone else, but we intend to defend this model come what may, as it keeps farmers on the land and stops the countryside from becoming deserted."
"In any case, the common agricultural policy will of course continue to represent an uneven playing field given that, as it is based on the idea of historical productivity, richer countries come off distinctly better than poorer countries, much as I dislike distinguishing between rich and poor countries."
"It is obvious that if some allowance were made for the difference between richer and poorer regions in Europe, the poorer ones would certainly not need so-called 'rural development', a rather vague and underfunded concept which we all know tends to mean that you only get out what you put in in the first place."
"The fact of the matter is that there will not be a budget for this 'rural development', which would in practice be a way of re-establishing the balance between the more- and less-favoured regions."
"Even in the sectors where we are undeniably more competitive - such as wine-making - there will not be any money for re-establishing old vineyards."
"On the other hand, the European Union still considers wool to be a non-agricultural product."
"It is to be hoped that with the promotion we have been promised for our products, and despite the limited funding we have been allocated, we can still be competitive in the war which is increasingly being waged at world level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financial framework agreed in Berlin is a totally inadequate response to the requirements and objectives of cohesion, which should be the guiding star for the construction of Europe and its present and future ambitions."
"So it is not surprising that despite earlier hopes that it would be maintained, the Cohesion Fund has emerged from Berlin with reduced resources, which will result in cuts for some cohesion countries, including my own, Portugal."
"Nor is it acceptable that, contrary to what Parliament approved in November 1998, the conditionality of the Cohesion Fund in relation to the stability pact is to be maintained, and that, for example, the Committee on Regional Policy should now be presenting an opinion in favour of the proposal for a regulation which envisages exactly this type of conditionality."
"Without affecting the cheques distributed by the various countries, regulating the Structural Funds, especially by means of intermediate assessments of the efficiency reserve and by a general lowering of cofinancing levels, will in practice result in appropriations being 'expenditure limits', whereas they were previously 'expenditure targets'."
"There will certainly be a big difference between what was announced in Berlin and what will actually happen."
"And these are not positive points like maintaining the URBAN Community initiative, which in fact runs counter to opinion in Berlin. This could make a difference to the considerable doubt concerning the soundness and the efficiency of the regulation of the Structural Funds in future."
"One last point about the common agricultural policy and the reform agreed upon in Berlin, or rather the non-reform."
"Berlin neither restored a balance to nor promoted a reversal of the present discrimination between types of production and farmers."
"A few one-off increases in financing distributed between a few countries will do nothing to change internal imbalances, and may if anything accentuate them, even within apparently more favoured countries."
"Mr President, I am speaking basically on the Arias Cañete report."
"We are going to vote against, as we did in committee."
"It is very important to stress that this is not because we do not agree with structural funds for fisheries."
"On the contrary."
"A fund is important to accomplish many necessary structural changes."
"But what we disagree with in this report is the way that it has emerged from the committee."
"Basically what Mr Arias Cañete wants to do is continue with the existing system which rejects changes and improvements proposed by the Commission."
"Two examples: last year the Court of Auditors examined in detail the funding for joint enterprises and made several critical comments."
"The Commission's proposal attempted to incorporate changes to improve the system."
"These were not taken up in the Arias Cañete report."
"The other thing is that the Commission does not want to fund the transfer of vessels to flags of convenience which flout international management regulations."
"But again this was not taken up by the committee or by the Arias Cañete report."
"As well as that we have two major problems with the Commission's proposal."
"The Commission has very little control over how money is spent and has publicly admitted as much."
"Too much is left up to the Member States."
"Not enough consideration has been given to criteria for granting aid."
"Vessels differ in their environmental and social impact and preference should be given to funding the withdrawal of damaging units and the creation of less destructive units."
"In committee we forwarded an amendment on transparency which was not accepted by the committee."
"Not only was it not accepted by the committee, but the rapporteur himself did not support it."
"This is unfortunate - plus the fact that the Rules of Procedure have left it impossible for us to submit this amendment again, which means that we cannot get a registered roll-call vote on the fact that Members are failing to adhere to the whole issue of transparency."
"That is why we are voting against this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, this is the last major debate in this parliamentary term and it is an excellent debate on a highly symbolic issue: Agenda 2000, as discussed in Berlin, in fact, with the German Chancellor, the rediscovered Reichstag, the rediscovered eagle and even a war."
"Obviously this makes a change from the rather puerile debates we have sometimes had over the last five years, such as those concerning lesbians, footballers' transfers or generic medicines."
"And Agenda 2000 raises important issues: the European agricultural strategy, the future of our food supplies, the structural policy and the financing of Europe, not to mention the opening up to the East."
"On agriculture, Commissioner, we are still on line 92, the McSharry line, the Steichen line, the Blair House line."
"Prices are being reduced - 20 %, 15 %, 30 % - with a small compromise in Berlin, partial compensation and some illusions."
"There are illusions because by playing around on the world market and lowering prices, we will certainly never be able to catch up with Argentina, for example, in terms of the meat trade."
"And it is certainly dangerous to play around on the world market and overlap free trade areas. This is illustrated by what Mr Martin said earlier in relation to winegrowers, with Sweden and Ireland being designated winegrowing areas so that they can obtain concentrated musts and perhaps manufacture industrial wines."
"And what good is an agreement in Berlin when in six months' time the world trade negotiations will begin and, just as in 1992, we are starting to make concessions even before those negotiations have started?"
"That raises the problem of our agricultural model."
"Mr Rosado Fernandes and many others spoke about it, just as you did, Commissioner."
"We talk about the European agricultural model."
"It is a model that stands for quality and welfare."
"It is a model that stands against the American model of intensive agriculture."
"Perhaps you have a third model, which I would call the Austrian agricultural model, because, alongside the Wagnerian American production, this would be light-hearted farming, with farmers looking after the countryside, nature and the environment, so that Sissi could go for a country walk at the weekend."
"No doubt that is what you call the environmental section of the CAP."
"Farmers would manage the countryside and eventually be included under the regional funds."
"That brings me to the Structural Funds."
"There, too, Berlin has hidden part of the truth."
"Apparently there are compromises."
"The Spanish wanted EUR 240 billion, the Dutch wanted EUR 193 billion and EUR 213 billion was agreed on."
"But in reality, the winners keep winning - Spain still gets the Christmas tree with EUR 9 billion and Great Britain still gets its cheque - while the losers keep losing."
"France has even lost out on Objective 1 and farmers are going to lose out on Objective 2 because they are now lumped in with the suburbs."
"Moreover, the Eastern European countries are soon to arrive and the planned funding is quite modest: EUR 3 billion a year for the pre-accession period, which is clearly inadequate."
"So what will we do then?"
"We will have to either share out the poverty between the farmers coming in and those who are already here, or we will have to create a new resource."
"And that is the third problem: funding."
"We are aware of this problem."
"Germany does not want to pay more, and it is quite right."
"It loses EUR 11 billion every year."
"France loses between EUR 1 billion and EUR 4 billion."
"So unless expenditure is reduced there is only one solution: resources must be found."
"Because of your foolishness in terms of constantly reducing customs duties, particularly as regards the GSPs, they no longer amount to anything: they account for only 14 % of resources."
"The share of VAT is falling."
"We obviously still have the GNP resource, but that is not a federal resource, it is the traditional contribution to an international organisation, a state's contribution."
"Berlin clearly sought to increase the share of the GNP contribution."
"But that is not enough: by moving to 20, 21 or 25 Member States, and putting a ceiling of 1.27 % of GNP on the budget envelope, we will not even last a few years."
"We need other resources."
"They cannot seriously come from the CO2 tax as Mr Ripa di Meana and the Greens believe, because nobody has ever seen carbon dioxide produce taxes, otherwise Pinatubo would probably be spitting euros. So there is only one resource left: a European income tax."
"And that is exactly where Berlin did not tell the truth."
"Just like the Europe of free trade, the Europe of the great single market lied; it did not tell us it was the Europe of 20 million unemployed and 50 million excluded. The ultra-liberal Europe is lying now and it is not saying that in 2006 it will be the Europe of taxation and the Europe of a European income tax."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, that is why, on 14 June, we want to come back and we will come back to change Europe."
"Mr President, following the charming address given by Mr Martinez, I fear my position will appear very banal. I in fact believe that, although it contains certain weaknesses, the agreement that was reached at Berlin on Agenda 2000 is a success that can be attributed to the German Presidency."
"The prophets of doom were proved wrong, and confirmation was given to both the priority that the European Union places on the policy of economic and social cohesion and the admirable and particularly effective cooperation between the main political Community institutions."
"Coming, as I do, from a cohesion country, Greece, I want to express my satisfaction with the provisions laid down in the three major chapters of the agreement."
"Firstly, as regards agriculture, I am satisfied with the preservation of the Community nature of agricultural policy, in spite of intense pressure to establish cofinancing measures.-Secondly, in respect of structural actions, I am satisfied with the preservation of increased per capita funding of the cohesion countries from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, and also with the emphasis placed on combating unemployment.-Thirdly, with regard to the chapter on own resources, I am satisfied with the adoption of a more just system which favours less-developed countries."
"My position, however, is that the system on own resources needs to be changed, which will inevitably lead to an increase in the Community budget so that needs can be met and the ambitious aims of the European Union can be fulfilled.-Finally, I would like to congratulate all those who contributed to this historic Berlin agreement, especially Commissioner Wulf-Mathies for her tireless effort and my colleagues for the quality of their opinions."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I shall now change the subject."
"I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I should like to sincerely thank the rapporteur, Mr Colom i Naval, because he has incorporated the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control in his report on the financial perspective and the interinstitutional agreement. I should like at the same time to refer to the most important, but also the most logical of these amendments."
"We have jointly agreed with the Council in the text that before the European Union's budget is adopted, an additional trialogue meeting will always be held at which the Council, the Commission and Parliament will agree on how possible additional requirements - last year there was the matter of aid for Russia - can be covered by the appropriations not utilised in the current financial year, or how new requirements in the next financial year should be dealt with and how full agreement can be reached on this before the budget is adopted."
"I think that this procedure comes very close to what the Member States want, but also what Europe's citizens want, which is that a rigorous and efficient budget be adopted each year."
"I should also like to mention another amendment which the rapporteur has included, and which is connected with the discussion that took place on Monday evening in plenary: the 1996/97 discharge procedure."
"We now have a procedure whereby new regulations are very often adopted by the Council without the old regulation having been evaluated."
"We have made a suggestion in this regard, and the Council has been prepared at least up to now to accept that if possible, a new regulation should not be adopted by the Council before an evaluation of the old one has been completed."
"If this could be carried through, we would achieve a real success because it makes no sense to establish during the procedure for a new regulation that the old regulation was in fact not acceptable and the new one reveals the same shortcomings."
"I would therefore invite the Council to establish its position once more on this matter in detail, because Parliament has done so."
"Mr President, I would like to present the main points of two reports I produced on the subject of the applicant countries for the Committee on Regional Policy."
"When EU aid is being allocated and prioritised, it is important to pay particular attention to matters of the environment and health."
"In order for the single market to function, including, inter alia, a free trade policy in food, it is extremely important that applicant countries comply with the relevant health and hygiene regulations imposed by the EU."
"The EU cannot make compromises on these issues within the framework of a period of transition."
"Instead, some degree of flexibility is required when allocating EU aid."
"In the Committee on Regional Policy we wish to stress the importance of three issues, in addition to that of flexibility."
"Firstly, we would like to emphasise the importance of cross-border cooperation while preparations are being made for membership."
"This is especially important in developing networks linking government, businesses and organisations."
"Secondly, we would like to stress the importance of nuclear safety, and, for that reason, EU resources granted for purposes of nuclear safety must be concentrated within the context of PHARE."
"Thirdly, we want to stress the importance of training people to promote the structural changes that are now under way in the applicant countries."
"All in all, prioritisation is important, but it has to be achieved through viable cooperation with the applicant countries."
"For that reason, the administration process must not be allowed to become too ponderous, especially when we consider how relatively meagre the resources are."
"I am also in favour of allowing the Commission a certain amount of licence in order to achieve maximum effectiveness in the area of aid."
"Mr President, I am going to speak on the Arias Cañete report on the structural policies for fisheries which is, of course, part of the Agenda 2000 debate."
"In our opinion, many aspects of Agenda 2000 are worthy of criticism and ought to be criticised, and some Members have done that this evening and in the course of the day."
"But that does not apply to the fisheries policy."
"The outcome in terms of the rules for assistance in the fisheries sector can be considered satisfactory thanks to the attitude of the Committee on Fisheries which opposed the Commission's original plan from the start."
"It opposed this original plan because it destroyed the horizontal nature of the intervention measures and established a financing system charged to the EAGGF Guarantee Section, which made the planning of this intervention enormously difficult."
"These aspects of the initial proposal were changed after Parliament voted against them a few months ago and the final proposal establishes a unitary instrument for intervention in the fisheries sector."
"Although there are still two regulations, there is only one fund, which means that structural intervention can be properly dealt with in the fisheries sector."
"I have nearly finished, Mr President, but I do not want to end without mentioning an important fact: modernising the fishing fleet is certainly important, structural intervention is very important, but the future of fishing, for our fleet, depends largely on the existence of international agreements with third countries to provide fishing grounds for that fleet."
"There are grounds for concern here, at least in some parts of the European Union."
"In my specific case, coming from Andalusia, I must point out that the Moroccan Government has just confirmed that it does not intend to extend the current agreement, which raises serious problems for tens of thousands of fishermen in my region, Andalusia, and also in Galicia."
"And although I know that this is not exactly what we are discussing today, I do not want to end without drawing attention to this very important problem."
"Mr President, as a politician representing a very rural constituency highly dependent on agriculture, I want to say that the outcome of the Berlin Summit of Agenda 2000 was not as disappointing to myself or my constituency as we first thought."
"The Fischler proposals cast a great shadow over rural Europe to begin with, but at the end of the day we have to appreciate that the outcome, while not totally satisfactory, certainly is not disastrous by any means."
"The fact that we are projecting to spend more money on rural Europe, together with the fact that the number of people involved in agriculture is decreasing, ensures that for the next seven years there is a minimum standard of living guaranteed to people involved in agriculture."
"I hope it will be made clear to everybody at all times that the concessions expected from us in the World Trade Organisation negotiations have been made and that we will not offer the prospect of any more concessions to the farmers of Europe until the present seven years have expired."
"We have had the MacSharry reform, another tranche of it now."
"Farmers have been traumatised by the fall in their income so I hope that is the end of it."
"I would like to say to Mr Fischler that while his message was not an easy one to sell he made a great effort to explain it to the farmers of Europe."
"His efforts are much appreciated, his efforts to educate and inform and bring public opinion along were commendable."
"I was not as happy with the outcome of the issue of regional policy."
"We are winding down regional policy."
"The region to which I belong retained its Objective 1 status but nevertheless it is only really Objective 1 in transition, because the amount of money received under the new Objective 1 is actually much reduced from the amount per capita under the last programme."
"In any case we, too, appreciate the efforts that were made by the outgoing Commissioner."
"She worked extremely hard, not only in visiting the depressed areas of the Union, but particularly in relation to Northern Ireland and all the cross-border schemes."
"Her presence was much appreciated and her total commitment to the whole issue of regional development is accepted."
"Finally, there is only one person in the room tonight who will have a vote in my election: Commissioner Flynn will have the opportunity to vote for me."
"I should like to say we much appreciate all the hard work he has also done, and indeed all the Commissioners."
"Mr President, I represent the EU's north-eastern periphery area, Northern Finland."
"I am currently examining the effects of the Agenda 2000 package on this region, which is one that is dependent on agriculture, although production conditions are much poorer than in the farming regions of Central Europe."
"The report on the Union's northern dimension states that the issue of the northern dimension must figure in all decision-making connected with the Union's internal development, in accordance with the resolutions of the Vienna European Council."
"In addition, a decision was taken at the Luxembourg summit that the future of agriculture must be safeguarded everywhere in the EU area."
"How did Agenda 2000 take these views into account?"
"Through negotiation the EU's northernmost farming regions, which are also the world's northernmost farming regions, gained a few important concessions to compensate for the costs incurred because of natural problems."
"The grain drying premium and forage aid are the right tools: they should simply be on a more adequate scale."
"Structural measures are important, but they are not enough in themselves to solve economic problems in the northern regions."
"The fields are covered in snow in April, whether they are thirty or two hundred hectares in size."
"It was still nearly ten degrees below zero in my home region just this morning."
"The logic behind paying aid by the hectare is very hard to explain to farm workers in northern Finland."
"Why should those who reap the best harvests receive many times more in aid payments than those whose harvests are small because of the natural conditions?"
"Hopefully, this trend will change, as Parliament has already agreed, and the differences in payments of aid by the hectare will be reduced."
"Mr President, as the French so wisely say, 'tout est bien qui finit bien '."
"We are at the end of a long haul, and we have got here in pretty good shape."
"The results are not perfect, but despite the inadequate budgets and the faint- hearted reform of the common agricultural policy, and the continuing injustices and imbalances that it preserves, we have nevertheless avoided a serious crisis in the European Union and it is fair to say that over the next few years the European Union will forge ahead with confidence and stability."
"This process has reached a satisfactory conclusion, and it has had a happy ending for the cohesion countries and for the poorer regions in which structural assistance is to be concentrated from now on."
"I cannot resist saying that it has come to a satisfactory conclusion for my country, which will receive structural support at an annual average level slightly higher than the annual average between 1994 and 1999."
"So Portugal and the other cohesion countries will be in a position to maintain their development and modernisation and converge with the European average, and this is actually happening, especially in my country."
"For this reason, we welcome the financial perspectives, the interinstitutional agreement and the structural policies."
"We wish to congratulate the German Presidency on the work it has done in the face of the scepticism which has beset this presidency."
"And I can tell Commissioner Wulf-Mathies - if I may paraphrase the words of a previous speaker - that if she were a candidate for election to the European Parliament in Portugal, the Portuguese would vote for her in droves."
"Mr Lage, I am bound to say that you have created a problem for us. If all the Members speak for twice as long as their given time, we shall be here until 4 a.m."
"I can quite understand those colleagues who, unfortunately, have only been given one minute for their speech, but those are the economics of the debate."
"I will stay because I have to, but the parliamentary services cannot stay here until 4 a.m."
"I would ask you not to exceed your allotted time."
"I understand - what can you say in one minute?"
"But it is not my fault."
"Ask the political groups to give you a little more time."
"It is all going to come to a head this evening: 30 speakers with one minute each!"
"How will I be able to stop them?"
"I feel terrible about this. But on the other hand, if one minute turns into two, we shall be here until 3 a.m."
"Mr President, I would say that the great achievement of the Committee on Fisheries was that, when presented with the Agenda 2000 proposals a year ago, it very quickly recognised the serious errors in the proposals on fisheries structural policy and immediately drew up a strategy which was stoutly defended by all the draftsmen of the opinions and, of course, by Mr Arias Cañete, the rapporteur."
"I should also mention that this strategy was agreed on in our committee after three public hearings with representatives of the fisheries sector and each and every one of the national fisheries departments."
"The result was the excellent report by Mr Arias Cañete, which has served as a basis for the negotiations with the Council."
"In my view, this report has led to an excellent compromise, which I welcome. Above all, I appreciate the fruitful collaboration that was displayed between Parliament and the Council."
"I include in my thanks all the staff who helped us reach a compromise that includes three of Parliament's principal objectives: a horizontal legal instrument, a single financial instrument, the FIFG, and a basic regulation finally covering all the financial structural measures."
"I think this has been one of Parliament's major successes, but we cannot rest on our laurels because we still need to ensure the continuity of certain measures with regard to the implementing regulation, and this is dealt with in the second part of the Arias report. In my opinion, without that continuity, the fisheries structural policy loses much of its meaning."
"For instance, we need continuity of measures to maintain a modern, safe and competitive fleet or measures that have proved to be extremely effective instruments of fisheries policy, such as joint enterprises with third countries. These are drained of content by the Commission's proposal, when they could be an excellent formula for cooperation with third countries, as will surely be demonstrated in the future in the case of Morocco."
"These demands are perfectly reflected in the report by Mr Arias Cañete, his final task for the European Parliament, and he leaves us with one of the finest and most comprehensive fisheries documents we have ever had the opportunity to consider."
"I therefore call on Parliament to vote in favour of this report."
"Mr President, coming as I do from northern Sweden, I should like to say a little about developments there."
"The situation is very serious up in the north of the country."
"Part of the problem is that activity in large segments of the state sector - and the private sector too - is either ceasing altogether, or being curtailed."
"In two thirds of Sweden's municipalities, the population has been on the decrease for several years now. And let us not forget that population densities were already very low beforehand, with three or four inhabitants per square kilometre."
"Many jobs in the interior are disappearing and local authority finances are extremely stretched."
"Regional policy is not proving very effective at all; in fact, it is rather ineffective."
"As part of the package Sweden negotiated when joining the EU, Norrland's interior was granted special Objective 6 status."
"Objective 6 is now to be merged with Objective 1."
"Equally, Objective 5b - which covers rural and island areas - is to be absorbed into Objective 2."
"We hope that the new Objectives 1 and 2 will prove beneficial for the areas affected, so that the northern parts of Sweden - and of other EU countries - are spared still further depopulation and migration."
"There has been a call for Objectives 1 and 2 to be granted an adequate share of overall resources; we trust that there will be something positive in the package for the development of northern Sweden."
"Mr President, Ireland has the European Parliament to thank for ensuring extra funding for neighbourhoods in crisis."
"This decision is particularly important for Dublin."
"I cannot be repeated often enough: in an otherwise very successful city there are pockets of enormous deprivation."
"The URBAN initiative will allow for projects to be undertaken in these areas to tackle the ingrained problems of long-term unemployment and urban decay."
"The Council, including the Irish Government, actually failed to reinstate this project."
"But we in Parliament had it reinstated."
"We succeeded there."
"This proves again how relevant Parliament is to ordinary people."
"This is my valedictory speech, Mr President."
"I want to thank you and all the Members and say what a pleasure it was to work here in this Parliament over the last five years."
"My colleague has spoken about the end; the end is nigh."
"I hope I will be back."
"We have a democracy in Ireland, a funny type of democracy: it decides who will be elected and who will not."
"We do not have a list system."
"Commissioner Flynn will appreciate that."
"I want to place on record my thanks to the outgoing Commission because in all the heated debates we have had nobody has stopped to thank those members of the Commission who have worked very hard for the people of Europe, the people we all here tried to represent."
"We have a very good line-up of hard working Commissioners tonight."
"Mr President, when we see what stage we have reached in the enlargement process it is perfectly clear that the views of Parliament have had a great deal of influence."
"Political considerations have taken precedence over economic ones, including in the way we have formulated and implemented our strategy in regard to the applicant countries."
"We are delighted that pre-accession aid has been principally focused on strengthening the administrative and institutional capacities of the relevant countries, including social dialogue, which is an important aspect of society in these countries."
"Democracy and states based on the rule of law form the basis of the European Union."
"They lie at its very heart and consist of much more than the acquis communautaire ."
"There is a place for countries which seek to become based on the rule of law, but not for those that do not. This clear stance has been a major force for good."
"In Slovakia, Romania and the Baltic states it has been taken very seriously, even if it is not always easy to apply political criteria in practice."
"A good example of this is the position of the Russian minorities in Estonia and Latvia."
"Decentralisation as an objective belongs among the political and administrative criteria and the EU must keep to this."
"I therefore welcome the fact that the reports have specifically referred to this point."
"Where possible management must be transferred to the governments of the applicant countries, which are already involved through cofinancing."
"It is good that the European Union is sticking with the PHARE priorities in all of this, making them its own strategy."
"Part of this is also the attempt to get the applicant countries involved in European political union, which is gaining a higher profile because of the emphasis on political criteria."
"There are great differences between the applicant countries, Mr President. This is why the guidelines and multiannual programmes must be drawn up for each country and for each sector."
"It is each country's own merits that count. However, it is not fair to constantly impose extra demands on applicants on the basis of our own national interests."
"I have in mind, for example, the resolution on the Temelin nuclear power station in the Czech Republic, which is on the agenda this morning."
"Nuclear safety is important, but we cannot simply demand or pressurise countries to close down nuclear power stations as part of the accession process."
"The accession conditions cannot be used in order to settle bilateral scores."
"Mr President, in two years of negotiation for seven years of European regional aid, of course there are areas where we would have wished to go further: clearer commitments, the partnership by local and regional authorities, even further guarantees that payments will be made on time to those delivering projects, a specific figure for social risk capital for the smaller voluntary organisations to benefit."
"Nevertheless, our intentions are clear."
"I want to underline two parliamentary achievements in particular."
"First, not only have we ensured that urban poverty and neglect are dealt with directly for the first time, but against all expectations we have retained an urban community initiative too, which can target the small- and medium-sized towns which currently receive less than 10 % of the funding."
"Second, whilst retaining a 5 % eligible population for poor rural areas, we have also succeeded in redirecting some CAP support from within Heading 1, off-farm, and Heading 2, rural development."
"My own region, Essex, in the east of England, has 18 urban wards in the 25 % most deprived in the UK."
"In the Cambridgeshire Fens, which have been part of the £50m 5-B Programme across East Anglia, but where 73 % of villages have no food shops, 74 % no daily bus service and not one a bank, these decisions offer hope."
"But for Europe as a whole, it ensures that the needs of severe pockets of poverty and deprivation can be tackled alongside help to large regions suffering industrial decline."
"It is an agreement which we can welcome."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this debate represents the end of a long discussion and decision-making process on the reform of regional and structural policy. Opinions may differ slightly on the individual points, but one aspect is clearly of overriding significance."
"The fact that we have kept to the timetable is an enormous advantage. It means that the review of the Structural Funds will be able to take effect in good time, in contrast to 1994, and that we will not be faced with a repeat of the dilemma we had five years ago."
"My group has from the outset declared itself in favour of reforming structural and regional aid, so that the financial resources available are concentrated on the regions in greatest need of development, but also so that greater individual responsibility is assigned to the Member States, particularly where entire regions are not eligible for EU structural aid."
"We welcome the fact that the new Objective 1 regions receive 70 % of resources."
"This means that it is now possible to target support at specific regions."
"However, we regret not having managed to introduce a separate objective for rural development which we have been openly in favour of the whole time."
"We also regret that with regard to the possibilities for national involvement, the Member States will not be allowed to select Objective 2 regions which do not meet the strict criteria, but will still be limited by criteria and the Commission's reserving the right to grant authorisation."
"We have always urged that a regional GDP per capita of less than 75 % of the Community average be strictly applied as the criteria for the selection of future Objective 1 regions."
"This has been successful on the whole, even though in the meantime there has repeatedly been the danger of speaking out in favour of flexibility on this matter."
"Opinion is divided within my group as far as the Cohesion Fund is concerned."
"Some of my colleagues - particularly those from the southern European countries - support the Commission's and Council's proposal to continue with the Cohesion Fund in its present form."
"Others believe that for the countries which are taking part in monetary union, the Cohesion Fund has achieved its objective and has made a fundamental contribution to nominal convergence."
"There is therefore no reason for it to continue to exist in its present form."
"Obviously, not all dreams can come true."
"Wishes still remain to be fulfilled."
"However, the compromise as a whole is a step in the right direction for the next planning period."
"Mr President, the last few weeks have been successful ones for the European Parliament in terms of our powers under the Amsterdam Treaty, the issue of discharge to have better control of Commission management and also, and not least, the vote on the Statute we took today to defer it to avoid some Council agreement being imposed on us."
"But what then of the financial perspectives?"
"There has been great progress and I would thank the German presidency for what it has done to add on to the financial perspectives vis-à-vis the Berlin Summit."
"We have made considerable progress, not least in classification and the way in which we can have conciliation across the whole of the budget."
"But for me, and many of my group, there remain some gaps in relation to the financial perspectives as they currently stand."
"The first refers to the rigour - not in categories 1 and 2, but 3, 4 and 5 where there is ambiguity in some of the declarations, in some of the phraseology, which needs to be clarified."
"Secondly, in terms of flexibility, we have indeed lined up for rigour in the financial perspective, but where we see that there is very little scope for flexibility, where some of it has been absorbed by URBAN initiative under category 2 and where we have no means of being able to use what parliamentary powers we would have under Article 203, then that means for me that a rigid corset has been set for financial discipline which is inappropriate for the years ahead."
"Lastly, in this context, there is no general review clause of this financial perspective which is heading off for the next seven years with no fixed date for revision and so no possibility of this Parliament or the new Commission collectively reviewing it at a particular date, irrespective of enlargement."
"Last, but not least, there is a problem which I notice has just arisen."
"It comes from our own President."
"Mr President I should be grateful if you would investigate this because our President seems to be paying more attention to influences outside this House than to parliamentary rights, claiming that the vote on the financial perspective should be a simple majority, rather than a qualified majority, though the chairman of the Committee on Budgets actually said it should be done by a qualified majority."
"I would appreciate it if this could be clarified tomorrow, otherwise there will be vigorous opposition in this House to what will be apparently imposed upon it by the President."
"Lastly, may I say that in terms of Parliament itself, I believe that we risk being without better flexibility and having this - what I would call - bureaucrat's dream of being able to spend money without having effective parliamentary control over a long period of time."
"We should continue to negotiate and come to a good deal with the Council as soon as we can, probably in the early autumn, alongside the agreements on the Statute."
"That way we will make sure that parliamentary rights are properly preserved and yet have continuity as we should in the budgetary process."
"Mr President, this agreement means that the Spanish countryside will lose 100 000 million pesetas a year and there will be a reduction of 5 % in agricultural incomes."
"It damages the interests of small farmers, who will have to compete with large multinationals in a totally unfair situation."
"Income from herbaceous crops will fall by 40 000 million pesetas, of which 23 000 million pesetas will correspond to cereals."
"Loyola de Palacio concealed the fact that the extra 550 000 tonnes for the milk quota does not attract a premium, and for bovine animals the increases will not make up for the agreed reduction of 20 % in prices, thereby producing a fall in incomes in this sector of some 30 000 million pesetas."
"Mr President, this is a bad agreement for the Spanish countryside, for Spain and for Europe and we will therefore be voting against it."
"Mr President, so as not to come under pressure of time, allow me to begin by doing something which I would not normally do until the end of my speech. That is to say, I should like to sincerely thank Mrs Wulf-Mathies for her positive cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy."
"By now everything has already been said at least once in the House on the subject which we are dealing with today."
"I would ask Mr Langen not to be tempted to heckle."
"However, one point has not been made, a point that in my opinion should be made, namely that we should rediscover the market economy if we want the people and the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe to one day fulfil the criteria for EU membership."
"If we are really showing or want to show solidarity, then it is not sufficient to hand out money."
"I know what I am talking about, since I come from a part of Germany which receives a considerable amount of funds from the European Union and western Germany."
"However, this alone is not sufficient."
"The principle of the market economy must be embraced wholeheartedly."
"If we really want to show solidarity, we must help the people of Central and Eastern Europe to rediscover this instrument."
"However, this means that we in the European Union first of all have to begin to actually embrace the market economy again ourselves."
"I am sure that you will not mind if I do not quite use up all of my two minutes' speaking time."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Agenda 2000 has preoccupied us for months and in my opinion it required all those concerned to be deeply committed to it."
"I should therefore like to begin by sincerely thanking Parliament, the Commission and the Council for the work that they have done."
"Countless negotiating rounds had to be held in order to achieve an acceptable compromise."
"Parliament was actively involved throughout the entire process and was able to influence the discussion."
"We have always declared our support for the further development of the common agricultural policy and of rural development policy."
"A radical course has been set for shaping the future European agricultural policy."
"This involves strengthening rural development policy as the second pillar of agricultural policy."
"A series of important environmental measures can still be pursued by means of this."
"Environmental measures for farmers can be safeguarded in the long term, and hill farmers and farmers in disadvantaged regions can be given greater support."
"I welcome the fact that the individual Member States have the opportunity to take part in the decision making."
"Certainly, the lowering of intervention prices for beef and cereals could not have been avoided, but it is due among other things to the commitment of the European Parliament that these were not reduced on the scale originally proposed by the Commission."
"I regret that agreement was not reached on the reforms in the milk sector."
"However, in terms of promoting disadvantaged regions, the decision to continue with the milk quota system, even beyond 2008, is of prime importance as far as I am concerned."
"With regard to matters which apply across the board, I certainly cannot agree to a degressive model of direct payments."
"In principle, I should like to say that the compromise already worked out by the Commission, the Council and Parliament has produced satisfactory results as far as I can see."
"On no account, however, should the outcome be jeopardised by the final vote which Parliament has yet to hold."
"It is now up to the individual Member States to use their room for manoeuvre as nation states as far as possible, and there are a number of possibilities for examining national peculiarities."
"These should also be taken into account for the benefit of our farmers, thereby creating and securing more jobs in rural areas."
"Europe's farmers and thus our European cultural landscape must not be sacrificed in favour of the world market; instead, we are demanding fair conditions for European agriculture, and this also applies to future WTO negotiations."
"I should also like to add my thanks to the Commission, to the Commissioners present, and all the others who have worked so hard during the period I have been in this Parliament."
"My group, the EPP group, can only note the result of the Berlin Summit and while it is a significant improvement on the original Commission proposal it falls far short of what is needed by producers."
"The promise of full compensation for price cuts given in 1992 has not been honoured in Agenda 2000 decisions, and while farmers suffer much lower prices, the cost of the common agricultural policy continues to rise."
"More importantly, consumers continue to pay more and more for their food."
"I fully realise the absolute requirement to make way for enlargement of the Union to the east and to ensure a satisfactory outcome to the forthcoming WTO round."
"However, it is not acceptable that so many farmers are given no alternative but to withdraw from farming because of the impossibility of making a reasonable income."
"Rural depopulation is rife, in spite of all the rural development measures."
"As I have repeatedly said, without the core business of farming most rural development projects cannot be successful, because they cannot stand alone."
"I realise it is difficult for colleagues from other Member States to realise how low farm incomes have fallen in my country, Ireland, mainly due to the fact that Ireland is heavily dependent on export markets, both in the EU and in third countries."
"Ninety per cent of our total beef production and 80 % of our milk production is exported."
"The BSE crisis in the UK has almost ruined our export markets."
"As consumption falls sharply and other countries rely on their own production without importing, the collapse of the Russian economy has further weakened a fragile market."
"The proposals on agricultural reform, while an improvement on the original Commission proposals, are not a long-term solution."
"If we are serious about protecting the European model of agriculture, with all its constraints and additional costs, and if we are serious about maintaining the rural countryside we must return to prices which are in some way based on, or linked to, the cost of production."
"Do we want a vibrant, living, well-maintained countryside or do we want a giant national park without people - and especially without young people?"
"I believe that is where Agenda 2000 proposals will take us unless we make changes without delay."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to depart from the subject of agriculture in order to discuss another important area with you, that of social policy."
"At Parliament's first reading on the European Social Fund, I recognised that the orientation of the programme will have a great effect on the objectives and regions in question."
"Nearly all the amendments we tabled have been included by the rapporteur."
"The ESF is still basically orientated towards labour market policies, and the PPE has placed special emphasis on this."
"Fund support only makes sense if the results of the projects are sustainable and they actually reach the target populations as well."
"The PPE agrees with the common position on the ESF."
"We would like to see the new ESF swiftly and smoothly implemented within the next year, without further loss of time and guaranteeing prompt and reliable planning for those responsible for the projects and for the Member States."
"For this reason, we absolutely reject a third reading and will be voting against all the amendments which would result in this."
"As shadow rapporteur, I would be able to support the amendments which have arisen as a compromise from the negotiations within the Council if the Council and the Commission confirmed that the amendments in question would in fact be adopted and the danger of a third reading therefore did not arise."
"The people of Europe expect us to support development in their regions, and to do so by means of speedy and practical measures which are not bureaucratic."
"We are placing a fund into the hands of the Member States in question, and they should not encumber or hinder it by laying down additional rules; instead, they can use it in a way which is genuinely in line with the objectives."
"Mr President, we keep changing the subject in this debate."
"It is not really appropriate, but I will now move on to the subject of the organisation of the market in wine."
"We have heard that there are certainly many things to find fault with in the part of the Agenda 2000 package that deals with agricultural policy."
"We must praise the Commission, the Council presidency, Mr Funke, and also Parliament for the progress made in one area; Mr Fischler, you took a long time to put forward such a good proposal, and you refused to withdraw the old one for a long time."
"Together we have managed to reform the organisation of the market in wine reasonably well, and I believe that after holding a debate like this one, we should not only voice criticism, but we should also give praise."
"It is sad that there is no wine here for those attending the last evening sitting of this parliamentary term."
"Mr Funke was certainly present when the former Federal Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, announced his watchword for the future wine-growing policy on German National Wine Day: we must drink more."
"A quotation from the past!"
"However, I should like to get back to the point."
"We have pushed through Parliament's demands in this reform of the wine market, and I can only emphasise here once again that it would be a good thing if Parliament were able to take part in the decision-making in the future, since we have mastered horse-trading in this House just as well as the Council."
"What has come out of the organisation of the market in wine is in any case praiseworthy."
"Corrections have been made to the regulations on distillation and the rights for planting new vines."
"The Member States have greater individual responsibility."
"It is now possible to set up inter-branch organisations throughout the whole of Europe."
"The reform includes programmes financed by the EU for restructuring, switching to different varieties, and modernisation of production techniques."
"The Council retains its powers."
"After all, we do not want to give the Commission too many powers, for instance over regulations on labelling and oenological practices."
"We must therefore preserve the traditional growing methods in Europe."
"Mr Fischler has also recognised and actively supported this."
"We are therefore satisfied with the reform, and I think that the broad agreement on the organisation of the market in wine has been a great achievement for Parliament."
"Only those who know of the dispute that has taken place in the last five years within Parliament over the issue of the organisation of the market in wine are in a position to appreciate how much progress has been made."
"I should like to thank you all, and I hope that we will have the opportunity to drink to this outcome with a glass of wine in the next parliamentary term, if not this evening."
"Mr President, regional policy is central to the equitable development of the European Union."
"The Union's structural policy plays an important role in supplementing development at national level."
"Just as important as how much aid the Union can afford to give is the question of how aid is used."
"The Member States have the ultimate responsibility for acting wisely."
"Regional policy administered according to the principle of transparency will also boost the confidence of the public in the work of the Union and how achievable results can be."
"EU structural policy resources must be targeted on investment in the creation of genuine jobs."
"The bottom line must be safeguarding employment and welfare in different parts of the continent."
"Regional development policy has to be all-embracing, motivating, and it must promote enterprise."
"The final decision on Agenda 2000 is a good European compromise."
"The fact that talks led to results in a situation in which the Commission had already resigned is proof of the viability of the Union."
"The Union can congratulate itself on the introduction of a package of reforms."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, like all compromises, the one reached in Berlin has its good and bad sides. Let us leave aside the many positive aspects."
"As I believe that it is always possible to mitigate negative factors, let me highlight three of them. First, the reform of the common agricultural policy, which I regard as being a poor reflection of the concept of rural development, as in the end both the winners and the losers will be the same as before."
"Secondly, the reduction in public participation in private revenue-generating projects, which, as it penalises companies, will also have an adverse effect on jobs. And thirdly, the concentration of funding under the next Community support framework in the earlier years, which, taken together with the normal flow of funds, will make accessing the Structural Funds a complex business, whilst funds that are not taken up will be lost."
"In addition to these general factors, there is another which I consider to be of crucial importance, namely the absence of practical recognition for the ultra-peripheral regions."
"After years of work to have them included in the Treaty of Amsterdam, it makes me very bitter to see that they have been ignored in Agenda 2000."
"Mr President, you may well say that we are reforming the Structural Funds at the very last moment."
"For here we are at a quarter to eleven in the evening, with Parliament still in full session and even the Council still present, on which I congratulate you, Mr President-in-Office, as I have never before seen the Council remain in Parliament until a quarter to eleven in the evening."
"We have now been busy for more than a year with the reform of the Structural Funds for the next term."
"It is now high time to give our final verdict, as otherwise the projects are not going to be able to start on time and I strongly oppose any postponement."
"I am therefore pleased to learn, as I did earlier today, that the Council and Parliament have reached agreement on a number of amendments to the European Social Fund which were threatening to lead to postponement."
"In November I argued for the Community's URBAN initiative to be continued, as the small and medium-sized towns which lie outside the objective areas, areas which are weak and ailing, also have their problems."
"I also argued for a new Community initiative designed to provide a flexible response to unexpected serious economic crises."
"In the Euroland era we need such a device, if you compare it to what you find in the United States."
"Parliament supported both initiatives, but the Council wanted just three and we already had three."
"So there were two too many."
"However, the Treaty amendments from the Amsterdam summit made it compulsory to take clear account of Parliament's views and we fortunately reached a compromise."
"URBAN and RESTRUCT were combined to form the new URBAN."
"The European Regional Fund will in future help solve the economic and social problems of towns and neighbourhoods in a state of crisis with a view to promoting sustainable development."
"I am pleased about this, and it would be a welcome development if the Commission could now find a little more money somewhere to spend on this initiative."
"I have already heard details of the new allocation, Commissioner, and thank you for giving the innovative measures greater scope."
"Mr President, perhaps I could make just one final comment to the Commissioner."
"As rapporteur for the 1997 Structural Funds discharge I should like to draw your attention to the fact that a country such as the Netherlands constantly comes out badly in the reports of the Court of Auditors, precisely because it adopts a more exact manner of reporting than all the other countries."
"Could you not take a look at these systems, so that this does not always come across so badly in the news coverage?"
"Mr President, for five years I have listened and learned in the Committee on Budgets that the only way to prepare a good budget and take advantage of all its possibilities is to conclude an interinstitutional agreement that guarantees the financial perspective for seven years."
"Today we are listening to proposals to make us condemn the interinstitutional agreement, thus leaving us without a financial perspective."
"Mr President, taking account of the latest negotiations and the flexibility accepted by the Council, I do not feel that the budget cut agreed on in Berlin justifies seriously endangering the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund."
"Unless there are final agreements between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, I am afraid that the only thing we are doing is promoting euroscepticism."
"Mr President, the European fisheries sector is in a difficult situation, and this is largely taken into account in the future structural policy."
"I will concede this, Mr Funke, but the fishing industry is a relatively weak sector of the European economy and requires special treatment, especially as there are mostly no alternative forms of employment in the regions dependent on fishing."
"Even our original demand for a separate Objective 4 for rural development with separate treatment for the regions dependent on fishing did not gain acceptance."
"From now on, therefore, the same measures will be funded by different sources in the different Objective 1, 2 and 5b regions, with Objective 1 regions clearly being in a better position."
"As a result, there is the threat of companies in the new Objective 2 regions moving into the Objective 1 regions solely because they will find better conditions and support there."
"Where I live in Cuxhaven-Bremerhaven, there is the threat of just this kind of sword of Damocles; such distortion of competition must not be the result of European structural policy."
"Mr Funke, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I think there are still some important things we need to do here."
"I should like to finish by thanking all those who helped to ensure that we continue to have an independent Committee on Fisheries in the European Parliament."
"For this reason I am looking forward to the new parliamentary term."
"Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office, I should like to briefly refer to Mr Barón Crespo's report again and to point out that we are preparing ourselves for an enlargement which stands out due to the fact that we now have a number of countries requesting EU membership that we would not have thought possible ten years ago."
"In the past, dictatorships were always given preferential treatment in terms of accession to the European Union if they were able to make their governmental structure a democratic one and found a way of doing this."
"If this was the case in the past, then it should certainly remain so in the future."
"Mr Hatzidakis pointed out in his speech that along with the transition countries of Central and Eastern Europe we also have an island in the Mediterranean. He was talking about Cyprus, which is also thinking of joining the EU."
"I should like to include a further Mediterranean island in the discussion, namely Malta."
"Neither of these islands comes under the preparatory pre-accession measures which apply to the other countries. However, like Cyprus, Malta is important geographically, and it has a stable democracy."
"It is true that both countries have been granted an extension of one year for the fourth financial protocol, but the structures are not in place for a pre-accession phase. If we are thinking of a kind of mini PHARE, then I would urge the Commission at some point in the near future to demonstrate to the applicant countries the perspectives under which they can approach their pre-accession phase, so that they obtain the same degree of specific planning criteria as the others, since those of us from the large EU Member States in particular should feel responsible for the small applicant countries."
"Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office, we have been discussing and arguing about Agenda 2000 for a long time."
"We can now see the results of this."
"In my view the winners are: the Member States in the Cohesion Fund, in particular the three which we believe should in fact no longer have been eligible; the Objective 1 regions that receive an even greater amount of funds than has so far been the case in the urban areas covered by the new Objective 2, which still even receive funds from the Community initiative URBAN; and the applicant countries which I only hope will not become a market economy, as Mr Schröder said, but a social market economy."
"Applause"
"The losers are definitely the rural areas and especially the regions bordering with third countries."
"When I look at the Commissioners sitting there at the front, it is clear to me why the regions bordering with third countries were not particularly taken into account."
"They do not come from these areas."
"Heckling"
"Three kilometres from the border regions, I have been told!"
"Commissioner, the unemployment criterion, which we argued about for a long time, still accounts for 50 %."
"Soft criteria are only 50 %."
"The problem with this is that the number of unemployed might not be very high, but the infrastructure and the number of skilled jobs might not be adequate either, and young people who are well qualified then move away from the area or commute."
"This is not everything."
"Capping agricultural expenditure - Mr Fischler referred to this himself today - is obviously an important issue that has to be viewed as negative."
"This will naturally result in even less money being made available in rural areas in the future, particularly in the areas where it is urgently needed."
"Commissioner, I have no wish to conceal how positive it is that we now have a safety net in the former Objective 5b regions, as well time-limits for transitional periods - it was not certain we would have them - and that the Community initiatives, Interreg and Leader, are better provided for than before."
"We must be fair and admit this."
"I think that we will also benefit from EQUAL."
"This is the last speech I will be making in the European Parliament."
"Thank you for your constructive cooperation. I should also like to sincerely thank those I have worked with and particularly the interpreters, who have no doubt had difficulty understanding my Bavarian dialect on occasion!"
"Applause"
"Mr Schiedermeier, you have put me in a difficult position."
"I was thinking about you and other Members whose regular presence in this Chamber was possibly coming full circle this evening, and we should give them the credit they deserve."
"In any event, you have made the announcement and I think that the Chair must acknowledge your extremely regular presence in this Chamber and your entire activity here, as well as the activity of other Members who can claim the same share of the credit."
"Mr President, I shall take ten seconds of my precious time to thank the Commissioners and the President for their stoicism in being with us at this hour of the night."
"With regard to the financial perspectives, I feel that it is crucial for the European Parliament to approve the framework defined in Berlin."
"If not, we will be responsible for enormous confusion and instability in the management of Community policies and we could even distort the fundamental options under Agenda 2000."
"With regard to the CAP, I must stress that the final agreement reached in Berlin was far better than the Brussels agreement."
"Nevertheless, the Berlin agreement was still a long way removed from the position adopted by the European Parliament."
"It failed to restore a proper balance to the CAP in terms of fairness and cohesion, and the less-favoured and peripheral regions are still threatened by depopulation and desertification. It also failed to create practical conditions for applying the European farming model and to establish the prerequisites for the European Union to go on the offensive in the forthcoming WTO negotiations."
"As far as Portugal is concerned, I deeply regret that some of my country's key specific problems were not taken into consideration."
"First, the effects of enlargement were not considered, although it is well known that the Portuguese economy is by far the most vulnerable to competition from our future partners."
"Second, the specific nature of Portuguese agriculture was not recognised, and the various kinds of production quotas were not extended, although Portugal is the country with the greatest deficit in the European Union, nor was any consideration given to increasing irrigation quotas, which would be invaluable given that in Portugal, which has the most backward agricultural sector in the European Union, irrigation has an essential part to play in modernising agriculture."
"Mr President, I want to confine my remarks to the report by Mr Arias Cañete on structural measures in the fisheries sector."
"In devising structural measures in this sector for the new millennium the overriding objective should be to keep them as simple and as cohesive as possible, to ensure that they are flexible enough to respond to the specific regional needs of fisheries and areas dependent on fisheries or where there are significant fishing communities."
"The original proposals of the Commission on structural measures were, to say the least, complex and in some places certainly could not be considered cohesive."
"For example, a proposal for the same measure to be financed from the FIFG for Objective 1 and 2 regions but from the EAGGF Guarantee Section for other regions could only encourage 'fund chasing', whereby fishing enterprises might relocate within the Community just simply to avail of funds for their particular project."
"If ever there was a recipe for regional dislocation and discrimination against traditional local industries likely to create unnecessary unemployment in the fishing sector, this was it."
"Contradictions in the Commission proposals for the restructuring of the fleet which is subject to the rules of the MAGP, which require national programming, compared to Objective 2 regions, which are subject to regional programming, would only serve to confuse other matters."
"The less favourable redefinition of coastal areas in Objective 2 from areas depending on fishing and in Objective 1 which would eliminate areas distant from the coast requiring structural funds to support aquaculture and processing has to be resisted and changed, as this is clearly discriminatory."
"I must welcome the Commission's decision to reverse its proposal to require fishermen to purchase an additional 30 % tonnage, which, if it had gone ahead, could only have been described as a penal law, designed to hinder the urgent need for modernisation and renewal of the fleet."
"The case to drop this proposal was forcibly pressed by Parliament's Committee on Fisheries and the unanimous view played no small part in reversing this decision."
"I wish to place on record my support for the Union's fishery sector to have a single cohesive structural policy."
"It is essential to guarantee that all regions with fishing communities continue to have improved access to fishery structural funds without any attempt to reduce the levels of funding or restrict or exclude access through increasing complexity."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that Agenda 2000 will bring tremendous change to the European Union, be it in agriculture or be it in regional policy."
"On regional policy I have to admit that I am extremely disappointed that Northern Ireland does not retain Objective I. But I want to pay tribute to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly for their support for me, and to the Council and Commission because I believe we have achieved a deal that we can live with and will be good for Northern Ireland in the long term."
"I am content with that. It is a compromise - a compromise that was a good one for my region."
"But I feel there is a real need to refocus, to relocate and reconsider and attain objectives that we have not been able to attain before: that is to ensure that we have not only got value for money but we also leave something positive behind where European money has been concerned."
"On agriculture the proposals will not improve the position of my farmers."
"It is a very difficult position that agriculture faces at the moment, not only in my own region but right throughout the whole of Europe."
"Low income has been a tremendous problem."
"But we in Europe must defend the principle of the family farm and must not allow others in the rest of the world to import into our area food that does not meet our standards."
"This is my last contribution in this Parliament, but I have every hope of returning to a future Parliament."
"I want to thank you, Mr President, the Parliament services and the Commissioners."
"I understand that on Friday I am going to have the great pleasure of welcoming Commissioner Kinnock to Northern Ireland."
"I understand I am going to have the great pleasure of welcoming Commissioner Wulf-Mathies to Northern Ireland before the election period is over."
"I am sorry I am not going to be able to welcome Commissioner Fischler to Northern Ireland before the election is over, but if he wants to change his mind he would be very welcome."
"It has been a great pleasure not only to be a Member of this Parliament, but over the past ten year I have found that Parliament has done tremendous work."
"And I say to you, Mr President, thank you very much indeed."
"While at times you get criticism - we all get criticism, so what!"
"You have been a good President."
"Thank you Mr Nicholson for your kind words."
"We have arrived at the end of a marathon debate on Agenda 2000."
"More than 80 colleagues spoke, even if for a very short time."
"I had every sympathy."
"Although I tried to be a bit hard because of the lack of time, we are still half-an-hour behind schedule, which means that we are going to go well over midnight."
"I would like to thank all the participants, firstly the President-in-Office of the Council."
"A colleague remarked earlier that it is rather rare that a President-in-Office sits so late at night to listen exhaustedly to an exhaustive debate."
"Naturally the Commissioners have been more accustomed to sit with us until very late."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 am."
"Procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission"
"The next item is the report (A4-0169/99) by Mrs Aglietta, on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Decision laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (COM(98)0380 - C4-0501/98-98/0219(CNS))."
"I give the floor to Mr De Giovanni, chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, who is deputising for Mrs Aglietta."
"Mr President, as you mentioned, I am deputising for Mrs Aglietta who cannot be with us tonight, and the first thing I want to do in starting my report on comitology is thank Adelaide Aglietta and acknowledge the serious and important nature of her work."
"She has produced a very competent, subtle, acute and effective report, ably assisted by the entire secretariat of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, in particular Patrizia Prode, and with constant back-up from Monica Frassoni."
"I wanted to mention that for one very simple reason: as we all know, comitology is hell."
"It seems like a technical problem but in reality it is a profoundly political problem, because then there is the problem of responsibility for monitoring implementation."
"This has always been a very serious problem and the European Parliament has tended to be diffident about it, partly because it has not always been clear who is responsible or how the European Parliament could carry out any monitoring or get any information."
"It has to be said that the absence of a monitoring and information system has become increasingly less acceptable as codecision has progressed."
"In my opinion we must always bear in mind the close relationship between codecision and comitology and now, after Amsterdam, with the power of codecision extended, it is all the more necessary for implementation to be monitored closely and effectively."
"That is why the European Parliament has sometimes had to take a firm stand, even to the point of blocking the decision-making process for financing committees from the Community budget."
"I must point out, especially as I went along with Jean-Louis Bourlanges, that it all had to do with the modus vivendi , and the modus vivendi is also an interesting point sometimes."
"It has helped us make progress, but actually it has rarely been applied, and then badly."
"What it has clearly demonstrated is that there is no way of resolving the comitology problem merely through more information, exchanges of letters, and documents from the Commission."
"They are important, but they are not enough!"
"We are at a different stage now."
"We have before us a Commission decision and this report - hence its importance - sets out the opinion of the European Parliament after many months of negotiation with the Commission and with the Council."
"At the end of these negotiations we can feel partially satisfied, but I would say very partially, because there is still a great deal to be done."
"So I want to clarify the European Parliament's real priorities, because I realise - and I want to stress this - that those priorities will have to be made increasingly clear, otherwise there will still be the risk of an interinstitutional conflict."
"Parliament has four priorities."
"The first relates to information, and on this point the European Parliament has obtained a great deal, in fact almost everything it asked for."
"Of course, we will need to make sure this agreement in principle is satisfactorily transferred into the final text of the decision. We need to prevent any legislative act being adopted by the Commission and the committees assisting it outside the regular codecision procedure, and to guarantee the European Parliament the right to intervene within a limited time-frame to challenge the legitimacy and content of an implementing measure, a point on which the negotiations produced partial satisfaction."
"And we need genuine simplification which goes further than merely abolishing the committee variants arising from the 1987 decision. Of course, I am referring, as everyone knows, to the great question of the regulatory committee, a question which remains open even after these initial negotiations."
"We are naturally hoping for greater satisfaction on this point in the future, because the European Parliament's attitude to the issue of monitoring is sure to become increasingly radical and clear-cut."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to go into the complex issue of comitology again now, but I should like to inform you about the opinion I have helped to prepare as rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, which it has adopted."
"Our aim was to make sense of what is really a labyrinth of delegated powers and create something that in fact concerns all of us, namely transparency, clear separation of legislative and executive powers, and democratic control."
"It is not at all my intention to dispute the fact that committees which stand by the side of the Commission are helpful in principle."
"However, I must make a serious point of criticism here."
"Community trade policy is one of the European Union's most important projects, but in this area Parliament is given hardly any opportunity for involvement in decision-making."
"During the present parliamentary term, we were not included once in codecision."
"The main committee active in this area, the 113 Committee, is completely outside our control."
"This is in fact not compatible with a genuine democratic institutional structure."
"There is therefore an urgent need for reform."
"Our aim was also to prevent the powers from being slowly renationalised."
"Surely there can be no question of civil servants from the Member States evading decisions that have been taken a long time ago - for instance, PHARE, TACIS or MED - by having to give their approval once again for major funding projects within a regulatory committee, or by being able to set them aside."
"This gives them quasi-legislative functions, and the regulatory committee as an institution should therefore be done away with altogether."
"Finally, on the subject of information, we do not think much of the vagueness of the wording which states that the EP shall be kept informed on a regular basis."
"We need to have precise and full information, agendas, the composition of committees and calendars."
"In terms of keeping the general public informed, this should not be a problem in this day and age with e-mail."
"I hope that the proposals of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights find sympathetic listeners within the Commission as well."
"Mr President, all parliamentary systems delegate implementing measures to the executive."
"They do not immerse themselves in too much detail."
"But what is peculiar about the European Union's system is that during all those years when the Council alone acted as the legislative authority, it was willing to delegate implementing measures to the Commission only on condition that a committee of national civil servants would work with the Commission."
"We had three objections to such a system."
"Firstly, there were so many committees set up with so many different procedures with nobody quite sure who sat on which that there was a major problem of transparency."
"Secondly, these committees set up by the Council or the Member States had the right to block an implementing measure from the Commission and refer them back, but Parliament had no such right."
"This was only possible for Council committees, not Parliament's."
"Thirdly, if a measure was blocked and referred back to the legislative authority, it was referred to Council alone, not Parliament and Council jointly, even though they jointly constitute the legislative authority."
"That we have found unacceptable."
"With codecision, though, it is now Parliament and Council jointly and equally which will decide on what measures to confer upon the Commission and what procedures will be adopted."
"We will use that power, Mr President - and I warn the Council that we are determined to use that power - to ensure firstly that there is openness and transparency (and I welcome the progress that has been made in that respect in the Council working group), but secondly to ensure that there is equality between Parliament and Council."
"In other words, if Council committees have the right to block the Commission and refer a measure back then Parliament should also have that right."
"And if a measure is referred back to the legislative authority it should be referred to both branches of the legislative authority, not just to one branch."
"There are some who claim that Parliament wishes to immerse itself in the detail of implementing measures."
"That is far from being the case: this is in the nature of a safeguard, the right to blow the whistle occasionally where you think that things may be going wrong."
"That is a right that exists in many national parliaments, - not in all of them, national systems differ on this, but it is one that should apply at the European Union level."
"If you look at the way we have used this power in the informal procedures that already exist, it is actually very unusual for parliaments to intervene and to blow the whistle."
"We have done it occasionally - infant formulae milk is a notable example."
"We blew the whistle, the Commission entered into a dialogue with us, changed its proposal and that was ultimately what was adopted."
"It worked."
"But it is very unusual."
"We do not want to do it very often, but we want the right to intervene when necessary."
"If we have that right then we will be much more willing to delegate more measures, knowing that we have that safeguard in place."
"But if we do not have that right, then we will be very reticent to adopt far-going implementing provisions."
"We will want to hold it back in the legislative procedures."
"We will not want to delegate."
"I warn the Council that although it has made progress on transparency, if the working group continues to be so restrictive on Parliament's rights to intervene, then there will be no agreement and we will continue in legislative procedure after legislative procedure to block the comitology measures and resist the adoption of such restrictive measures and we will be very restrictive on voting the budgets and the credits to allow comitology-type committees to continue to meet."
"We are not seeking to take powers to ourselves to intervene in the detail but we are seeking to have the safeguard."
"That safeguard is very important."
"It is the principle on which we will insist and unless agreement is reached in this matter I can tell Council that codecision procedure after codecision procedure will have to go all the way to conciliation and time after time there will be difficulty on this problem."
"I invite Council to take the last few steps to reach an agreement with us on this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of comitology is literally poisoning relations between Parliament and the Council."
"Indeed, it goes even further: it serves as a screen against public opinion, because the complexity of this comitology mechanism has succeeded in making the opaque fog around decision-making even thicker in the eyes of the public."
"It is therefore a public service to clarify this obscure process and make it slightly more transparent."
"When the European Parliament was granted the power of codecision, it might have been assumed that the two arms of the legislature were going to be treated equally."
"But this was far from the case."
"Was it treachery, bad faith, incompetence, negligence or ignorance?"
"I have no idea and I am not going to guess."
"Article 145 of the Treaty on the delegation of implementing powers has still not been amended whereas lawyers generally consider that it should have been."
"Because it has not been amended, these powers remain with the Council alone, while it ought to be shared equally by the two arms of the legislature."
"When the case came before the Court of Justice, it departed from its traditional integrationist case-law - which lasted until the number of members increased beyond nine - and kept to a strictly formal interpretation of the texts, against all logic and against the fundamental principles of consistent legal interpretation."
"In fact, it is not normal for the body - a binary one, in this case - that decides on the law to be different from the one taking decisions on the delegation of its implementation."
"There is an error of logic in that situation which has only been possible because the lawyers were negligent when they drafted or amended the Treaties."
"This matter could have been corrected in the Maastricht Treaty."
"It was not, and that is because, yet again, neither Parliament nor the Commission made much effort to clarify the situation."
"The Commission was extremely timid, not to say cowardly, about it."
"So now we are trying to repair this mistake through an institutional agreement."
"We might have expected the Commission and the Council to acknowledge, finally, in this agreement that Parliament's claims were well-founded."
"But this was far from the case."
"Concessions have been made, and there has been a little progress."
"It is a little less complex, a little more transparent, but that is about all."
"Of course, we are going to take what is on offer."
"We accept any progress, but at the same time we must express our dissatisfaction, and also our hope that next time the Treaty is amended, this error will not be repeated."
"Mr President, it is after all three obligatory and two non-obligatory committees which play a role within the framework of comitology and the Common Fisheries Policy."
"The committees have a vital role to play, for example, in the preparation of TACs and quotas, and in the implementation of the Multiannual Guidance Programme for the Community Fishing Fleet."
"The relations between the Committee on Fisheries and the comitology committees just mentioned have two main aspects: firstly, the reception by the Committee on Fisheries of information on the activities of the committees and, secondly, the possibility for members of the Committee on Fisheries to participate in meetings of the relevant committees as observers."
"However, the information sent is insufficient and often arrives late. The current procedure for sending observers is also very unsatisfactory and is in fact even inappropriate."
"Unfortunately, any amendments proposed to date have been rejected."
"Mrs Aglietta describes three objectives, or three good reasons why there should be a new comitology decision; these are simplification, democratisation and transparency."
"The Committee on Fisheries shares the view that improvements in these areas are urgent and absolutely necessary."
"Mr President, forgive me for requesting to speak once again, but there has apparently been - or there may have been - a translation error."
"I do not want the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights to be abolished;"
"I was referring to the regulatory committee. I think it is quite important to mention this, in case Mr Kinnock has been informed otherwise."
"Apparently, it was translated differently in Italian."
"So it is the regulatory committee that I should like to be abolished."
"I am grateful for Mr Kreissl-Dörfler's contribution."
"It was not so long ago that there were people in this House who wanted to abolish the Commission, so I am much relieved by his news."
"I begin by offering my warmest thanks to Mrs Aglietta, the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job in clarifying the so-called comitology issue which, in terms of the procedures of the European Union really is rocket science."
"I admire, on a personal basis, the honourable Member's tenacity in pursuing this dossier over difficult months."
"I regret that other obligations prevent her from being with us in order to discuss her report tonight."
"We did, however, have a distinguished replacement, Mr De Giovanni, who showed his customary fluency and, above all, his very considerable technical insight when he described comitology as pure hell."
"Five years ago I thought comitology might be an inflammation of the bowel or a trapping of the sciatic nerve."
"Now I know much better and I share that in common with this House."
"It really has been an advance in my general knowledge."
"The system, obviously, as has been said in the debate, facilitates an important link between the Commission and the representatives of the national authorities who sit on the committees and assist the Commission in its executive role."
"But as we have also heard, the number and complexity of both the functions and the types of committees raise concern about the transparency of the whole system."
"I am sometimes amused by popular descriptions of Parliament, and indeed of the Commission, as being institutions which clog the progress of the European Union."
"If only the general reporting press knew about comitology and the accumulating habits of Member States, it might bring them a revelation."
"In addition, with the introduction into force of the Maastricht Treaty and the codecision procedure, this Parliament naturally and, in my view rightly, insisted that all implementing decisions should be subject to some form of control by the legislature."
"The resulting modus vivendi that was adopted in December 1994 went some way towards achieving that objective."
"But as we heard from Mr De Giovanni, it was clear even then that the issue had not been definitively resolved."
"In June 1998, therefore, in accordance with the Declaration annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission presented a proposal to revise the 1987 comitology decision and we did so with the aim of making the procedure less complex, less opaque and more open to Parliamentary control."
"Honourable Members will, I know, be familiar with the major elements so I will not detain the House with a description."
"Suffice it to say that as a result of the discussions under the Austrian presidency and the German presidency which has made strong and commendable efforts to get an agreement in the Council before the end of June, and with significant parliamentary input in last September's resolution and now in the Aglietta report, we have reached a stage of negotiations which is likely, hopefully, to be conclusive."
"Naturally Parliament's requests have been at the centre of the discussion."
"I would like to make just a few responses to the more salient issues raised."
"As far as the right of scrutiny is concerned, Article 7(a) as proposed in Mrs Aglietta's amendment goes in the direction that the Commission wanted."
"It takes on full legal value and it makes a political dialogue with the Commission possible on the occasions when Parliament believes that a proposed measure would provide excessive implementing powers at the expense of the legislature, a point forcibly made by Mr Corbett."
"An interinstitutional agreement could subsequently be concluded to clarify how this provision would actually operate in practice."
"As for the informing of Parliament, the Commission is confident that the requests made in the report we are discussing for extensive transmission will be agreed in Council."
"In order to achieve that the Commission is willing to establish the most modern means of communication so that Parliament will be able to exercise its scrutiny continually and through up-to-date facilities."
"We also agree with the idea of having greater clarity about the scope of executive measures set out in the basic legislation itself."
"In that context it is clear that for us, as in the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice, any adapting or updating of legal acts cannot entail modifications of essential elements of the original legal act."
"Last, but not least, on the regulatory procedure, it is unfortunate, in our view, that the discussions within the Council have ruled out the Commission's proposal of a return to the legislature and often to the co-legislators when the committee does not give a favourable opinion."
"However the current formulas devised by the negotiators would be acceptable to the Commission provided that there is no double safety net or contrefilet which would give the Council the means of rejecting a proposed executive measure. The reason for such a stipulation is very obvious."
"If there was some form of double safety net it would quickly become impenetrable and the Community would be prevented from taking any decision at all."
"In the interests of the Union, the Member States and indeed the institutions therefore, we think it essential to support the relevant amendments to the legislative solution submitted by Mrs Aglietta."
"We have now reached a significant point in the process of simplifying the system of comitology and making it more democratic."
"After thorough examination and many informal contacts at all levels Parliament should now be in a position to give its opinion on the proposal so that the Council can pursue its work with a crystal clear view of the wishes of this House."
"Naturally the Commission will continue to contribute actively to this work in the hope that by the end of the German Presidency we can reach an agreement that will satisfy all three institutions and consequently benefit the interests of the citizens of the Union whom we exist to serve and millions of whom are doubtlessly still awake tonight, awaiting the outcome of this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Fixed-term contracts"
"The next item is the report (A4-0261/99) by Mrs Jöns, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Directive concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC (COM(99)0203 - C4-0220/99)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have obtained codecision in social policy by means of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"However, whether or not we agree tomorrow to the social partners' framework agreement on fixed-term work comes down to exactly the same thing in the end."
"This will be the case more and more from now on, since the incorporation of the social protocol into the Amsterdam Treaty will mean that the social partners will always be consulted first."
"The ball will only be in our court again if they fail to achieve a result."
"Amsterdam does not even require us to deliver an opinion at any point during this procedure."
"The fact that we are now able to deliver an opinion is solely because the German Presidency insisted upon it."
"The Commission only forwarded the draft directive to Parliament on Monday."
"We are therefore now seeing, barely one month before the European elections, that the Amsterdam Treaty in fact limits our rights quite considerably in the area of social policy."
"This does not make it any easier to explain in the European election campaign why it is so important for our citizens to vote in the June elections."
"Surely it is unacceptable for European laws to be made in this area without the European Parliament having any kind of formal involvement in this."
"Not only did Amsterdam fail to remove the democratic deficit in social policy by including the social protocol in the Treaty virtually unchanged, but it even increased it."
"This kind of atavism needs to be eliminated at once."
"I therefore strongly urge the Council and the future Commission to conclude with us as soon as possible - by the next revision of the Treaty - an interinstitutional agreement which also does justice to Parliament's direct democratic legitimation."
"That we are rejecting the current procedure does not however mean that we would therefore automatically be against all the outcomes of the social dialogue."
"I am merely thinking of our unanimous agreement in favour of parental leave."
"However, social partners' agreements do not relieve us of the duty to examine them critically, as we did with the agreement on part-time work."
"Allow me to come straight to the point: more and more people have fixed-term employment contracts."
"In the European Union, the number of employees in fixed-term employment has increased from 14 million to 17.5 million in the last three years alone."
"However, long-term employment relationships are still regarded as the sole guiding principle for both social insurance and conditions of employment."
"This in turn involves various forms of discrimination for fixed-term employees, as we all know."
"The fact that the social partners have now agreed on a principle of non-discrimination for fixed-term employees is to be welcomed all the more."
"But unfortunately the same does not hold true for mandatory social security, although the social partners could have extended the non-discrimination principle to this as well."
"This was already possible under Maastricht."
"The only progress achieved on the highly controversial part-time agreement is that the exceptions from the principle of non-discrimination are cited more clearly."
"However, I absolutely cannot comprehend why the provisions combating abuse of fixed-term contracts do not relate to the first contract, but only to successive contracts."
"What is more, the Member States can even choose from three options here."
"They either define objective reasons or a maximum duration, or the maximum number of extensions is defined."
"This agreement does not set a single uniform minimum standard."
"The provisions, which are uniform for everyone, stipulate only that one of the three possible provisions must be chosen."
"In future, we must - and I think this is essential - make it perfectly clear once and for all what we understand by uniform minimum social standards, but I still urge you to agree to this agreement, because otherwise we will be left with nothing at all."
"Mr President, Member States have committed themselves to the European employment strategy and to the four pillars of the employment guidelines, including the pillar on adaptability."
"They have also called upon the social partners to engage in negotiation with a view to reaching agreement at every level to promote adaptability by balancing flexibility for workplaces with security for workers."
"The Commission has done the same in its Green Paper on a partnership for the future organisation of work and in its subsequent communication."
"The social partners are therefore to be congratulated for adding this new agreement on fixed-term contracts to their earlier agreement on part-time work and I hope they will soon pursue a fresh agreement on workers placed by temporary employment agencies."
"But that, Commissioner, still leaves the difficulty of social security provisions for atypical workers, part of the original atypical work directive."
"It is clear that cannot be tackled by the social partners and it is something that the Commission is going to have to tackle urgently."
"It is an outstanding matter that we need to address very quickly."
"Like any agreement under the social dialogue provisions of the social chapter this agreement illustrates a new facet of the democratic deficit, as the rapporteur has just explained."
"We, the Parliament, have no formal rule in relation to agreements like this. That also needs to be tackled urgently by Treaty amendments and in the meantime by interinstitutional agreement."
"The final point I want to make is this Mr President: I am hearing rumours that one or more Member States might be interested in creating difficulties for this agreement in Council."
"I hope those rumours are not true, but if they are, I want those involved to think very carefully."
"Do they want to be responsible for killing social dialogue at European Union level and these important steps to promote adaptability?"
"That would be the result."
"I hope that rather than obstructing they will endorse this agreement as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, I am pleased that we can still discuss the Jöns report today."
"I believe the rapporteur should be congratulated on having been able to get this item on the agenda at this final part-session of the parliamentary term."
"I continue to believe that social dialogue is important and that we must also discuss the consequences of social dialogue."
"I do not believe the Commission has any cause for complaint."
"We wanted to discuss this at this final part-session and the Commission simply followed the traditional line, and if this had not been the final part-session it would have been on the agenda next month."
"So I do not believe the Commission has any reason to complain."
"I do not believe the Council played much of a role at all."
"If the Council had wanted to play a role, it should have adopted an interinstitutional agreement which would have put an end to the unacceptable situation that the European Parliament is not, formally speaking, sufficiently involved in the results of social dialogue."
"There is also the matter of social security."
"I do not believe it is possible to ask the social partners to deal with the social security consequences of their agreement."
"The Council disagrees with this, which means that it takes just one Member State to insist on this position and nothing happens."
"But I should like to repeat my request for the Commission finally to draw up a directive in the field of social security, so that the Council can no longer take refuge behind the excuses it has been using to date and we will have genuine Council debate on a social security directive."
"I think these are the principal points."
"Finally, we nevertheless find the rapporteur's report to be much too critical of the work of the social partners."
"It seems as if the Socialist Group actually lacks confidence in the social partners, while at the same time giving the appearance of having so much faith in them."
"That rankles, Mr President. We have seen it during this debate."
"The PPE has confidence in the social partners, is ready to let them take on the job, which is why we also want to accept this, we want to improve the procedure, but that is as far as it should go."
"We do not need to study everything agreed by the social partners in minute detail."
"Mr President, Mrs Jöns' report, I believe, is a good one, since although she too urges the Council to approve the agreement negotiated by the social partners, she at the same time strongly criticises that agreement."
"The agreement is really nothing more than a very small and modest step towards improving the status of those engaged in atypical work."
"The new Commission should embark without delay on a programme of action to find a solution to these as yet unsolved problems."
"The most important is the issue of extending legislation to cover other forms of atypical work, such as homeworking and hired labour, which have become much more common of late."
"The other task to address is the guarantee of social insurance for all employees, irrespective of the form of their contract."
"There are considerably more women than men with atypical contracts of employment."
"Thus discrimination against those undertaking atypical work is at the same time a form of gender discrimination on the labour market."
"Ending this should be a priority task for the Union."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her report."
"I welcome this agreement between the social partners."
"The social dialogue has a significance of its own, leading as it does to agreements at European level between management and labour."
"This particular accord is the third of its kind and I would like to see more, covering such things as people working for temporary employment agencies and distance workers."
"A balance does need to be struck, however, between agreements as such and legislation, and I shall be coming back to this."
"Agreements always involve compromise between the social partners. This one is no exception."
"Its two most important features are that contracts of an indefinite duration are the rule, and that those with fixed-term contracts will not suffer discrimination."
"Social security is not covered, as the social partners did not see any scope for successful negotiation here."
"We have consequently urged the Commission to submit proposals in this equally important field."
"Let us hope that action will be forthcoming in the not too distant future."
"This framework agreement is a sound one, in my opinion."
"If - as Mr Hughes says - some Member States are creating difficulties over legislative adoption in the Council, then that is extremely serious."
"We have here an important agreement between management and labour."
"Any blocking in the Council would be very damaging for the social dialogue."
"Mr President, I should first like to thank those who have contributed and particularly you, Mrs Jöns, for the speed of the response to the social partners agreement on fixed-term work."
"The Commission only adopted the proposal for a directive last Wednesday."
"I know it is a short time span but it is a very important initiative both in principle and in effect."
"For the third time the interprofessional social partners have concluded a major agreement at European level in the framework of the social dialogue process."
"The agreement applies the principle of non-discrimination to fixed-term workers and it also establishes a framework to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts or relationships."
"The Commission welcomes the agreement."
"It welcomes it as a significant advance in terms of non-standard forms of employment and as the most comprehensive and refined agreement the social partners have produced so far."
"At the request of the social partners the Commission has now adopted my proposal for a directive to make the provisions of the agreement binding in the Member States."
"By giving your opinion so quickly you will make it easy for the Council to proceed with adoption of the directive at the end of this month, in time for the Cologne Summit."
"The agreement comes at an important point in the development of our shared agenda."
"Not only has the Amsterdam Treaty just entered into force but we are at a key point in the implementation of the Union's employment strategy."
"These events confer real opportunities and of course serious responsibilities, too, upon the European social partners."
"The confirmation which this agreement offers of their commitment and their capacity to contribute to laying down social rights is an important and welcome message."
"It is important because the agenda on working conditions and employment must now be one of the social partnership for the modernisation of work. It is important because we need to find a new balance of workplace flexibility and of course worker security, especially as new technologies, competition and the new demographic profile of the work force change the conditions for companies and for workers and indeed for public policy too."
"This social partnership requires a culture of adaptation and anticipation of change."
"That demands trust and cooperation on the basis of informed choice."
"That cannot happen without practical steps, like the proposal you have before you today."
"Although the European Parliament has not been given a formal role in the procedures under which this directive will be adopted, I have worked closely with you up till now to make sure that the Council has the full benefits of your views and to ensure that Parliament has the broadest role possible within the limits of the Treaty."
"For me this has been a worthwhile effort. I want to thank you for the way in which you have continued to work on the agreement and the proposal for a directive in spite of the difficult timescale that has applied here."
"When you think back to 1990 when we made the first proposal dealing with atypical work, there were three strands to that: nothing happened."
"The Council blocked everything, it was impossible to make any progress and here we have two collective agreements that have been achieved in the meantime."
"So I am satisfied that we are making progress here."
"As regards the question about the interinstitutional agreement: I regard that as necessary."
"Documents have been prepared to advance that."
"Unfortunately it cannot be concluded just now but certainly it is an important matter that should be attended to as a high priority with the next Parliament and Commission."
"I regard it as a good proposal and I would like to agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns."
"It has been requested, as you quite rightly said, by both the presidency and by the European Parliament as a matter of urgency."
"One has to thank Parliament for being so generous in allowing this to happen."
"It is a good example, as Mr Hughes has said, of the social dialogue at work, in action, and we can look forward hopefully to a success in May."
"I hear rumours, too, but perhaps there is sufficient good will in the Council, recognising that the social dialogue is a fundamental matter and that this is a 'deal done', an agreement between the social partners."
"How could they turn their backs on it?"
"I will be looking forward to that kind of good result in May."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Protection of workers from the risks of explosive atmospheres"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0155/99), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council (13836/4/98 - C4-0003/99-95/0235(COD)) with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive on minimum requirements for improving the safety and health protection of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres (Rapporteur: Mr Pronk)."
"Mr President, this is the second reading of the common position on the health protection of workers who may be exposed to risks from explosive atmospheres."
"It is a second reading and what we have tried to do is look at the Council's common position compared to the Commission's original proposal, and compared to its development following the amendments brought by Parliament, although not by me as rapporteur, as I took this on somewhat later."
"On the basis of all this we concluded, again in cooperation with the European Commission, that we had to formulate a number of amendments."
"At that time we did not of course yet know that this would be one of the first reports in the social field to come under the codecision procedure."
"Since 1 May, just a few days ago, when the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force, health and safety has come under the codecision procedure."
"I believe that this marks a significant new departure."
"It means that the Commission's role remains unchanged but becomes somewhat easier as it is no longer faced with the united front of the Member States saying that they want to go back to the common position agreed earlier."
"The Commission is then always faced with the problem of whether it should stand its ground and defend Parliament's amendments to the bitter end or bring the matter to a close."
"All this has now been made easier. If there is no agreement the matter simply comes back to the European Parliament and then we must all discuss it and vote on it."
"I think that the Council in particular, which when it comes to social policy has not proved exactly progressive in its relations with Parliament, still has to get used to this."
"I look forward to being able to discuss this with the Council in the future."
"Mr President, I have one question, which arose after we had completed the amendments."
"It concerns the position of LPG in the directive."
"I should like clarification from you on this point."
"Article 1 includes an exception, but there is a difference in interpretation between myself and your services on the one hand, and the English authorities on the other. The latter seem to give a different and somewhat broader interpretation."
"I should like to hear the last word from you on this point, so that the Minutes will be there to help the subsequent legislative process."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Pronk for the work he has done, following Mr Mather, who dealt with it at first reading."
"On the second reading of this report he has been quite right to re-present Parliament's amendments which were not accepted by the Council and also to include part of the Commission's text deleted by the Council."
"We in the Socialist Group will be supporting the amendments he has tabled."
"There are certain concerns about some of the amendments."
"I have seen a number of briefings, for example, about Amendment No 7."
"Mr Skinner will speak about this in a moment."
"I have read and reread the text several times and have also had contact with the Commission services."
"I cannot see how Amendment No 7 can be interpreted as meaning that all the equipment has to be replaced; adapted, yes, but that is a totally different prospect."
"Such adaptation seems very important to me for workers' health and safety."
"It is on that understanding of the meaning of the amendment that we will support Amendment No 7 as well as the others."
"Perhaps it is just as well that this proposal will now be subject to codecision."
"Conciliation might give us an opportunity to reach some understanding on these matters with the Council."
"In closing what will be my final speech in this Chamber for this mandate as chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I would like to thank all of the Members of this House for their cooperation in moving forward the number of dossiers we have in this area of work in the last five years; and you too, Commissioner, for your valued cooperation."
"The progress that has been made will stand as a testament to your commitment to European employment and social policy."
"Mr President, I should like to add my heartfelt thanks to the rapporteur, whom we have seen on many an occasion take on the mantle of health and safety, to you, Commissioner, and your services for expediting much of the legislation which has been necessary in this field, and for your assistance both formally and informally in helping Parliament to understand what can and cannot be done."
"Indeed now, as Mr Hughes has just said, we move into the difficult area of codecision which can help us."
"In this particular directive we can seek further clarification from the Council."
"Mr Pronk and I have managed to find a compromise on Amendment No 2, which has led to a better text."
"I look forward to the Commission and the Council accepting that text."
"But Amendment No 7, where disagreement lies, certainly requires a large amount of clarification."
"Until we get that it is not one that I am going to be fond of supporting."
"However, codecision is going to be about sensible discussion."
"I hope the Council will respond to what Parliament votes tomorrow."
"I too would like to say that I have enjoyed working in health and safety."
"I spent some time working on a lot of these reports."
"I must commend Mr Hughes, the chairman of the committee."
"The intensity of this discussion on health and safety has been led through that chair."
"I wish him the very best and hope that maybe, when we both come back in July, we will continue some of that particular discussion."
"Nonetheless I would like to hear from the Commission as to what we can do about Amendment No 7."
"Mr President, let me first of all thank you, Mr Pronk."
"You have done a remarkably good job on what is regarded as a very technical matter."
"The Commission is prepared to accept all of the proposed amendments."
"The Commission considers in fact the Council's common position as a step forward towards achieving better protection for the health and safety of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres where fatal accidents occur every day."
"Nevertheless, you know that the Commission has maintained some reserves as regards the common position, for example on appropriate supervision and on the deletion of items in Annex 2 covering additional risks resulting from power failure and the need to provide for manual override where automatic processes deviate from intended operating conditions and the need to be able quickly to dissipate or isolate accumulated energy in the event of an emergency shutdown."
"The text of the common position in these areas is considered by the Commission to be weaker than the amended proposal."
"The Commission therefore considers that the amendments proposed by the European Parliament are essential for the establishment of a strong, coherent prevention strategy against the risks arising from explosive atmospheres."
"As regards the amendments on the establishment of the vademecum and on the requirements for provision of information to undertakings, particularly SMEs. I share your view that a simple statement in the Council's minutes is not a sufficient guarantee of follow-up."
"Finally, the rapporteur's approach to bringing the proposed safety sign into line with the international CEN ISO standard is a good approach."
"As far as LPG is concerned, of course, the situation is that road traffic regulations cover the question of, say, tankers of LPG being delivered to a filling station."
"LPG in a plant is covered, but in a filling station the end user, a car, for instance, is not covered under Article 118a or 137."
"I would like to say as well that we have no difficulty with Amendment No 7 as it is our understanding as well that equipment is to be adapted, not replaced."
"That is an understanding I can give to the House."
"If I may, Mr President, this is probably our last meeting together on some very important broad issues that deal with working people."
"I would like to finish by recording my personal pleasure and satisfaction with what we have achieved together on the development of employment policy and social policy agenda for the European Union."
"I would like to record my appreciation for the important contribution that you have made to achieving our shared objectives."
"When the history of the development of social policy and employment policy comes to be written subsequent to my leaving the Commission, the period 1993-1999 will be recorded as quite a remarkable period for change, for advanced thinking and for Treaty change support."
"For those of you who will not be returning I want to congratulate you on the contribution you have made to social policy advances over these last few years."
"They are quite significant and they will make a real difference to European citizens."
"For those who will be back in July your responsibility to build on this base that we have started together will be quite immense."
"I believe it will be made easier because of the work and the cooperation that we have had these last few years."
"I want to say to you, Stephen Hughes, as the chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, it has been my personal pleasure to work with you, not just as a good parliamentarian, but as a gentleman of credibility and integrity."
"You deserve your place in this House and I know that you will be back with your friends here to continue the good work."
"It has been a personal pleasure for me these years and I have gained enormously from the experience."
"I am full of expectation for the good things that will be achieved in the coming years for the citizens of Europe."
"It has been my pleasure to have been part of that advance."
"Applause"
"I must say that it may not be very original but still, it does provoke emotion."
"It appears that this is an evening when we are reminded of Shakespeare who urged us to 'bring garlands'."
"We are distributing garlands tonight."
"But it is justified after years of hard work."
"It has been difficult sometimes but we have also had satisfying cooperation."
"On the part of the presidency of Parliament I must thank Commissioner Flynn for having been very pleasant here - sometimes a bit long in his explanations, but otherwise trying hard."
"Mr President, I am very glad that the Commissioner has accepted all seven amendments."
"Seven is a holy number which expresses a certain fullness and that is very good."
"I would like to thank you for all the cooperation with our group, Parliament, and Mr Hughes, who has been an excellent chairman in this connection."
"You have been a 'stayer'."
"In skating terms that is someone who may start a bit slowly but goes on and achieves an awful lot in the end."
"That is what it is all about in politics."
"I thank you very much for that."
"We have achieved a lot on social policy."
"We can now go to the electorate with those results, partly or indeed mainly thanks to you."
"There is a little plaque hanging in my office."
"It is a quotation from Abraham Lincoln, who was President of the United States from 1861 to 1865."
"It has been my political motto all my life."
"As I leave you I would like to quote it for you: 'I do the very best I know how, the very best I can, and I intend to do it till the very end."
"If in the end I am proved right then all the things that people have written against me will count for nothing."
"If in the end I am proved wrong then angels swearing that I was right all the time will do me no good.'"
"I am sorry to depart from this rather poetic atmosphere but we still have some work to do."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 am."
"EC-Mexico Partnership Agreement"
"The next item is the recommendation (A4-0220/99) by Mrs Miranda de Lage, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion of the Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the United Mexican States, of the other part (COM(97)527-11618/97 + 11620/97 + COR 1 - C4-0023/98-97/0289(AVC))."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the debate I am opening on the now famous global agreement with Mexico ends a five-year cycle during which Parliament has worked actively with the European Commission to renew and strengthen relations with the Latin American countries, including Mexico."
"The Commission's communication on Mexico provided the opportunity for us to draw up a first report in 1995."
"The conclusions reflected Parliament's priorities and, as a sine qua non for adopting a future agreement with that country, the conditionality or human rights clause, political dialogue and parliamentary dialogue were priorities, as well as regional development, social development, assistance to women at risk and a long list of other points. Of course, in addition to the objective of liberalising trade, we also wanted the agreement to include guarantees for environmental protection and respect for the basic labour standards of the International Labour Organisation."
"Parliament's demands have been adequately reflected in the articles."
"The agreement includes the trade objectives of the interim agreement, but also incorporates a social philosophy, a range of possibilities for cooperation in areas such as professional training, regional development or support for cultural diversity."
"Recital 7 relates to the social and environmental issues."
"I am highlighting this because I want to express my appreciation for the constructive position of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions on this agreement."
"As a result, I would suggest that we look for some formula which makes it possible to incorporate recital 7 into the bilateral political dialogue, giving a clear signal that any requirements, including the basic standards of the ILO, commit the 15 Member States and Mexico equally, and not just Mexico alone."
"A calm and impartial analysis of the text leads to the conclusion that Parliament's influence has been considerable."
"But I must point out that this influence was possible thanks to the excellent attitude of the Commission, and I am grateful for its collaboration throughout this process."
"In other respects, everything is not rosy, and I have to come down hard on the Mexican Government."
"It should take careful note that the Committee on External Economic Relations categorically rejects the tariff increase announced by Mexico on 1 January this year."
"That decision was inappropriate and arbitrary as well as being discriminatory because it does not apply erga omnes ."
"I must adamantly insist that this measure be abolished as soon as possible."
"The decision is unfortunate because it accelerates the increasingly evident deterioration in trade flows. These have been affected for five years by the dynamism of NAFTA, and thus our share of the Mexican market has fallen from 11 % to a modest 6 % over that period."
"The Committee on External Economic Relations had already drawn attention to this deterioration in Mr De Vries's report in 1990."
"NAFTA's arrival has had negative consequences on our interests and I must stress that point."
"Approval of the report we are debating will strengthen our political position and allow us to use this instrument to follow up the negotiations on political, social and economic issues, including, most particularly, the paragraph on democracy and human rights."
"We need to talk about those issues."
"The legal provisions to improve them and defend them have substantially increased in Mexico, and it is only fair to recognise that."
"The opinions by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation stress the need to broaden and improve the conditions for development. The Committee on External Economic Relations shares this view and emphasises it in a paragraph in this report."
"We are offering faithful cooperation and we also support the search for a permanent solution to the Chiapas conflict."
"Mexico is a developed, dynamic country, and a member of the OECD, playing an increasingly active role in relations within North and South America and with Europe."
"Our association with Mexico is more than a market, and more than a facility for getting access to NAFTA."
"It is a political commitment of profound significance."
"The adoption of this recommendation will send a good signal to the Americas at a time when doubts are growing about our will to increase European efforts in the region."
"The Union faces a number of challenges: its peace obligations and commitments and the dilemma of enlargement."
"Now is the time to send a positive signal to the upcoming first summit of Heads of State and Government, that is, the 15 plus 33."
"The philosophy of this agreement includes important development policies."
"Like any compromise, it may be unsatisfactory in some areas, but nobody can deny that it opens the door to wide and meaningful possibilities for collaboration. And nobody can deny that, precisely because of its content, it has generated a considerable level of debate."
"Mr President, this may be my last speech in this Parliament, and I want to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Marín very sincerely for the hard work he has done on cooperation with Latin America."
"I also want to thank everyone who has cooperated in this endeavour throughout the years and - obviously - all the members of the secretariat of the Committee on External Economic Relations who have worked towards these objectives, as well as all those who have believed in the advantages of cooperation with Latin America."
"Finally, in view of the late hour, I would also like to thank the interpreters for their patience."
"Mr President, my group recommends that we give our assent to the global agreement with Mexico for four fundamental reasons, and two of them are based on the pure logic of democracy."
"Firstly, all the parliamentary committees involved, the Committee on External Economic Relations, the Committee on Development and Cooperation and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, have clearly requested it."
"Secondly, the main political forces and the leading political groups in Mexico have also requested it, and it has been called for and approved by all the Member States of the European Union."
"In my view, it is not legitimate that the course of the interim agreement, to which Parliament gave its assent at the time, should be confused with and affected by the course of the global agreement"
"And finally, I feel that it is perfectly true that when defending human rights - which certainly leave much to be desired in Mexico - it is much better to defend them with an agreement which includes a clause on democracy - as this global agreement does - than with the existing agreement which does not contain such a clause."
"I would like to take advantage of this debate to make two points which I consider important. First, I want to reiterate Mrs Miranda de Lage's comment that the Mexican Government must promise to withdraw the unilateral increase in tariffs before the end of this financial year."
"Secondly, the European Commission must undertake to keep Parliament informed on the outcome of the trade negotiations before they are concluded."
"Finally, Mr President, for all the reasons I have mentioned, my group urges the European Parliament to give its assent as decisively and firmly as we condemned the human rights violations that had occurred in that country at a stage."
"Mr President, at this stage it is difficult to find anything new to say, especially with regard to Mrs Miranda de Lage's report, which could not be more complete, and given what my colleague Ignacio Salafranca has just added."
"In actual fact, there are many reasons to start saying that Mexico does not have the proper reference point, the proper democratic credentials, and so on. But I think Mexico, democracy and the agreement with the European Union will be best served by giving our assent."
"Insisting on perfection often means that all we do is stand in the way of progress."
"And there is so much that is positive about this agreement, so in this case the best thing we can do is support it."
"We know that Mexico has a democratic deficit, but the best thing we can do to help Mexico establish a democratic structure is approve this agreement with the European Union."
"I would also like to highlight some points within the agreement which, as I understand it, are rather original, such as the inclusion of the democracy clause as an essential element of the agreement."
"This will promote respect for human rights in this Latin American country and it will produce better results in this field than possibly delaying the vote, which would make political and social cooperation difficult."
"As has already been mentioned, we also hope that the new agreement will serve to revitalise trade between both partners - the European Union and Mexico."
"Only 9 % of all Mexican exports to the European Union are agricultural and there is considerable complementarity in the trade flow. This should facilitate the rapid negotiation and entry into force of this agreement."
"In short, I want to reiterate what the previous speakers have said and I feel that this agreement is extremely positive for Mexico, the European Union and, as a result, the progress of democracy in the Western world."
"Mr President, I wish to speak in favour of the Mexico partnership agreement and to congratulate the rapporteur on her work and thank Mr Marín for his contribution."
"I most certainly am not a supporter of neo-liberal policies but the removal of trade barriers is a fact of life and the coming into force of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement has increased Mexican dependence on trade with the United States of America."
"The EU-Mexico agreement is therefore urgently needed to help restore the balance and to foster political and cultural, as well as economic, links between Mexico and Europe in the interests of both sides."
"I have long been deeply critical of human rights abuses in Mexico and have been associated with urgency motions passed by this Parliament and other manifestations of our profound concern."
"I believe, however, that the conclusion of this agreement will facilitate the continuing dialogue on these issues which will give the European Parliament far more leverage than if the agreement did not go ahead."
"I am, however, most deeply anxious that the Commission should monitor the situation and we should not hesitate to speak out."
"I am disturbed that there is concern in Mexico that full information has not been provided, that civil society is being excluded and that multinationals and private capital interests have carried too much sway."
"These are matters on which Mexican representatives have every right to raise their voices and I, for one, would hope that they would meet with a sympathetic response in Europe."
"However, the postponement of the decision on this accord at this point at the end of this Parliament would not, in my view, be in the long-term interest of the Mexicans or of Europeans."
"Many of us have fought hard to build links and create solidarity between Europe and Latin America as a whole and the casual postponement of this accord could be very damaging."
"I believe that we should all vote for this agreement to go ahead because, among other things, it will help to achieve a better human rights and democratic rights record in Mexico over the course of future years."
"Mr President, I think the first thing that needs to be said, because it is the general feeling in Parliament today, is that we are all in agreement - I do not think there is anyone who is not - that we must strengthen our commercial and political relations with Mexico and with Latin America in general."
"It is a pity that Mexico's trade with the United States is increasing so much, under a trade agreement which does not actually contain a democracy clause or other clauses that are included in this one, and that its trade with Europe is decreasing."
"Having made it clear that we do want an agreement with Mexico, we cannot ignore the many questions raised by quite a number of significant non-governmental organisations, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International League for Human Rights and Intermón ."
"In other words, many groups have expressed their concern to us and we share their concerns. First, the negotiations are not over yet."
"Secondly, there has been a lack of transparency, a lack of participation and a lack of information. And lastly, there is no mechanism for monitoring the environmental and social clauses or the democracy clause."
"There is no clear monitoring mechanism."
"I want to end by saying that we are a pluralist group and we will perhaps be voting in different ways."
"I proposed abstention, active abstention, and my good friend Ludivina García Arias, who has a great affection for Mexico, asked me what active abstention meant. Mr President, active abstention means no more and no less than that we are not washing our hands of the agreement with Mexico, that we want an agreement, but we want a good one."
"That is why we are suggesting active abstention, and we are going to work for an agreement which, in the end, will satisfy both Mexicans and Europeans."
"Mr President, the Amsterdam Treaty has been in force for just a few days."
"It finally gives the European Parliament more rights with which to carry out one of the most important duties of a parliament, namely involvement in decision-making and controlling the other institutions."
"It was precisely this which justified our decision a year ago to agree to just the Interim Agreement with Mexico, and to give our assent to the Global Agreement only once negotiations on all parts of the Treaty had come to a close."
"We did not want to give the Commission carte blanche ."
"Incidentally, these were the words used by our rapporteur, Mrs Miranda de Lage, to justify the decision."
"The Mexican Parliament also only approved the agreement on the condition that it will be consulted again once the negotiations have come to a close."
"It is therefore not fair to claim that the Mexicans accepted the agreement a long time ago."
"There has been no change in the situation since."
"There has been no new Commission paper on which we could make a decision."
"The negotiations will last for a long time yet, and civil society in Mexico is extremely dissatisfied with this."
"Various parties, such as the PRD, which has also written to us, and the Greens in the Mexican Parliament do not agree with the way the negotiations are taking place."
"They insist on the need for a fundamental change in direction and strongly urge us not to give our assent yet."
"In my view, it would therefore be completely irresponsible towards European citizens, but also towards our Mexican partners, to hand over control now."
"Why are we agreeing now to something that does not yet exist in its entirety?"
"It makes no difference whatsoever for the Commission to be able to continue negotiations."
"But I am standing up for the rights of a parliament to take a vote on something which must in principle exist as a whole."
"How could we justify to the public the fact that we are campaigning for more rights for Parliament, although we are saying that we do not want to make any decisions, and instead want simply to give carte blanche ?"
"It is precisely this which I do not understand."
"I must say one more thing on this matter; it is after all the last round of speeches this evening."
"Obviously I am in favour of an agreement with Mexico, and this applies to the entire Green Group."
"I hold my colleague, Mrs Miranda de Lage, in high esteem and I also have the highest regard for her work."
"However, this problem of how a parliament makes a decision is of fundamental importance for me."
"It is just about this and nothing else."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement submitted today for ratification by Parliament represents an essential stage in the ambitious voyage we set out on four years ago to establish a new relationship with Mexico that would fulfill our hopes."
"The revitalised situation in Mexico led Europe to seek a framework of strategic relationships with that country based on reciprocity and partnership and built on mutual interests. We were motivated by the importance of helping to build an international community based on democratic principles, the rule of law and full respect for human rights."
"We were also motivated by the importance of reaffirming, within the international debate, that it is possible to conclude bilateral trade agreements that are compatible with the World Trade Organisation. Finally, we were motivated by the importance of giving a boost to our economies, thus promoting the growth of world trade, and by the importance of consolidating our respective presence in interdependent geographical areas."
"That is how Parliament saw it back in 1995, when Mrs Miranda's report provided the political impetus needed to move towards more ambitious objectives."
"And that is how Parliament saw it in May 1998, when it gave its assent to the interim agreement."
"And I would like to take this opportunity - as I have mentioned Mrs Miranda - to thank her and her predecessor, Mr Newens, for their hard work, together with others who have been involved in this area and participated in the process, such as Mr Salafranca, Mrs González Álvarez and, in general, even those who have always been critical or have opted for a much more critical approach to our relations with Latin America as a whole."
"Today you have before you the global agreement that establishes the legal framework for our future long-term relationship."
"Like the interim agreement, this new agreement puts special emphasis on what has been one of the main demands of the European Parliament, to which the Commission and the Council have given maximum priority: the clause on respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, an essential element and foundation of this relationship."
"The first is to institutionalise political dialogue at the highest level. The second is to extend and deepen our cooperation, and here, for the first time, there is explicit provision for cooperation on human rights and democracy, and important areas such as social development, the fight against poverty, environmental protection and consumer protection are included."
"I can confirm what most of you have said: if we want to make progress on the issues I have just mentioned, political dialogue makes much better progress with an agreement than without an agreement."
"And finally, the third element, the economic element, is very important too, establishing a free trade area between the European Union and Mexico covering both goods and services."
"Now let me tell you about the progress achieved to date in the trade negotiations."
"Four rounds of negotiations have now been completed, and there have been substantial advances on the main goods and services issues, with excellent progress on investment, public contracts, competition and intellectual property."
"While there are still certainly some points of disagreement, that is more an indication of the high and intense level at which the negotiations have taken place than of fundamental obstacles."
"We share the great concern expressed by Parliament about the tariff increases imposed by Mexico and we will inform the Mexican authorities of it."
"We hope that Mexico will respond by eliminating these increases as rapidly as it can."
"We trust that we will be able to achieve substantial results for the Rio summit in June so that this exercise can be concluded in the second half of the year."
"Obviously, Parliament's assent to the agreement will contribute significantly to providing important political impetus to allow us to conclude the process."
"I want to assure you that the Commission formally undertakes to keep Parliament informed at all times - as is already the case - on the progress of these negotiations as well as the final outcome, before submitting the agreement to the whole Council."
"And, of course, the Commission will consult Parliament on that outcome, in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Treaty."
"So I cannot see that the Commission is being given a blank cheque."
"That is impossible, because Parliament will always have the last word when the negotiations are concluded."
"Finally, the Commission hopes that Parliament will see fit to give its assent so that the agreement can enter into force, and we thank you again for the great support we have always received from this Parliament, not only with regard to strengthening relations with Mexico, but also with regard to establishing a real alliance between Europe and Latin America, which is gradually being forged."
"Mr President, I would not want this debate to end without expressing, on behalf of my group, our recognition of the work Commissioner Marín has done as the Commissioner responsible for relations with Latin America."
"I also want to express our satisfaction because, in my opinion, as draftsman, the explanations and clarifications Mr Marín has given tonight entirely meet the Committee on Foreign Affairs' demand that Parliament should be informed of the development of the negotiations before their conclusion."
"So many thanks, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, for the information you have given and for your response to Parliament's proposals."
"I in turn would like to thank Vice-President Marín for his period of cooperation with the European Parliament."
"It has fallen to me to preside over many debates in which he has taken part, and I have always been struck by the attention he has paid to the views of Parliament and by his willingness to cooperate fully."
"This evening has unfortunately turned into a marathon session."
"I have been in the Chair for more than three and a half hours. It has been a very tiring day, but we had to complete our examination of all these issues because we have no time left, even though there are very few Members remaining - which is only natural at this late hour."
"Unfortunately, there are no reporters anywhere to observe just how much work goes on in this Parliament."
"They arrive at midday simply to write about scandals, but beyond that they do not pay much attention to what goes on and do not see some people at least working very late and very hard."
"Before I bring this evening to a close, I would like to personally thank all Members of all political affiliations for their work and cooperation during this parliamentary term."
"You all know that it is not in my nature to solicit applause, but I very much appreciate the respect and the positive attitude I believe I have had from all Members, and I thank you all very much."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The sitting was closed at 0.35 a.m."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, we received the news overnight that Ibrahim Rugova is now in Rome, and I wonder whether you could ask the President if he would, on behalf of this Parliament, convey our best wishes to Mr Rugova and to his family."
"You will recall that in the April plenary we passed a resolution in this House inviting Mr Rugova to address the Foreign Affairs Committee."
"It is proposed that we hold a Foreign Affairs Committee meeting on 21-22 June for the purpose of a hearing with the High Representative."
"However, it would seem to me at the very least appropriate that we should invite Mr Rugova also to address that committee."
"What are your comments on that suggestion, and could you convey that idea to the President?"
"Thank you for that suggestion, Mr Spencer."
"We have all heard that Mr Rugova has arrived in Rome, happily with his family, and I think it is natural for him to come here to Parliament."
"I shall pass on your proposal to the President, and I do not think there is any obstacle to inviting him to come to Parliament on 21 June."
"Mr President, in all the confusion during the vote on the Rothley report yesterday I mistakenly voted in favour in the final vote, when I actually meant to vote against."
"I would ask you to amend the Minutes to show this."
"It would not change the outcome of the vote, ladies and gentlemen, but it really was all very confusing."
"I would specifically request that this should be done if at all possible."
"I would also ask you to note that I did vote on Amendment No 18 by Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, but my vote is not shown in the Minutes."
"I actually voted in favour."
"We have noted that, Mrs Maes, and it will be recorded in the Minutes."
"Mr President, on page 8 of the Minutes, under the heading 'Approval of the President-designate of the Commission', there is a record of Parliament's vote approving the designation of Mr Prodi by the Heads of State and Government."
"It says that the President congratulated the elected President."
"I think that the wrong terms are used here."
"In order for there to be an election there needs to be several candidates and a democratic process."
"I think that it is the designation of the President that has been ratified or approved by Parliament, but I do not think that insisting on talking about an elected President, when the President has been designated, is in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"I can inform you, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, that the wording used is in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, but we shall of course double-check that, I can assure you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that it would be useful to briefly add to what was very rightly said by our colleague Mr Spencer concerning the particular request that Parliament has made with regard to someone who was under its protection, Dr Ibrahim Rugova."
"I would like to say that above and beyond all the comments that are naturally going to be prompted by his visit to Rome, our main objective should be the return of all of his compatriots to their country."
"I welcome the suggestion that Dr Ibrahim Rugova, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize by this House, should come and address us in June for as long as is necessary."
"We asked to go to Pristina."
"The Serbian authorities refused, saying that they could not guarantee our safety, and we had to give in to them."
"It is good that now all roads lead once more to Rome."
"Mr Rugova should come, and we should find out what has been happening to him."
"The important thing is to restore peace to the Balkans and for those people to return to their territory."
"I think a very broad majority of the House could endorse that, Mr Soulier."
"I also think it is important, if the President accepts Mr Spencer's proposal - as I am sure he will - that it is then announced publicly that the new Parliament is going to receive Mr Rugova as one of its first actions."
"Mr President, my name was not included in the list of people who were present at yesterday's sitting."
"I would like my name to be added to the attendance register."
"We have noted that, Mr Sarlis."
"Mr President, in our debate last night on the Colom i Naval report on the financial perspectives 2000-2006, it was drawn to my attention that the indicative list of vote for this morning at 11 a.m. is recommending that this interinstitutional agreement should be approved by a simple majority."
"The Committee on Budgets has written to the President advising this should be done by qualified majority because we are handing over a number of powers if we approve this agreement."
"It will have to be done by qualified majority."
"I insist, on behalf of many colleagues, that the President circulate a note arguing why he is recommending this should be done on a simple majority."
"This should be headed off before 11 a.m. otherwise we could find a repetition of the kinds of problems we had with the Rothley vote yesterday."
"I can assure you that the President of Parliament is well aware that a decision has to be taken, Mr Elles, and he will be chairing the sitting himself at 11 a.m."
"I will pass on what you have said, so that he understands your views."
"He will then take a decision, as I say."
"Mr President, I would like to join in with Mr Spencer and Mr Soulier in expressing my satisfaction."
"But I would also like to make another suggestion, not just that Dr Rugova should be invited to visit us as soon as possible."
"As today is our second-last working day, I would like to ask our President, Mr Gil-Robles, together with the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, to see whether it would also be possible to send a small European Parliament delegation to meet Dr Rugova in Rome, where he is at present, because I do not know what will happen within the next month, month and a half or two months."
"There is an opportunity for a quick meeting;"
"Mr Spencer and Mr Soulier themselves, together with Mrs Pack, chairman of the Delegation for Relations with South-East Europe, could be given the task of organising this meeting, which could take place in the next few days."
"I will forward both your proposal and that by Mr Spencer to the President, Mr Imbeni, so that he can decide - if possible by tomorrow - how we should respond to the situation, now that Mr Rugova and his family have arrived in Rome."
"I wish to second that, and I should also like to thank Renzo Imbeni for his proposal."
"I spoke to Mr Rugova on the phone last night."
"I would ask that we be given the opportunity to see him even before the committee meeting in June, because he will be in demand over the next few weeks and, I fear, will be misused by some people."
"For that reason, I believe it is important that we should grasp the opportunity to speak to him very soon."
"If you can find a way of making that point to the President, it would certainly suit our purposes."
"I should be willing to sacrifice a few slots on my electioneering schedule to that end."
"Thank you for your support for the proposals by Mr Spencer and Mr Imbeni, Mrs Pack."
"Mr President, I had asked for the floor in order to support Mr Imbeni's proposal, but Mrs Pack has already spoken now and I agree with her."
"That is all."
"Mr President, I should simply like to remind some of our colleagues, and Mr Elles in particular, that the way the institutions take decisions, in accordance with the well consolidated case-law of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, is not something we can tamper with."
"It is a question of law and order and is enshrined in the Treaties."
"And as far as the Treaties are concerned, unless it is expressly stated, this House takes decisions by simple majority. In addition, there is ample case-law stating that the acts are what they are and not what any interpretation may make of them."
"This also applies to the effects such acts may have, no matter how sensibly they may be interpreted."
"Finally, Mr Elles is well aware that the Committee on Budgets, a well respected and very competent committee, is in no way an internal body with the powers to dictate which majority should be used to take decisions in this House."
"I will likewise refer your comments to the President of Parliament, Mrs Palacio, who is coming to chair the sitting and the vote at 11 a.m."
"The Minutes were approved"
"Schengen"
"The next item is the oral question (B4-0336/99) by Mr Voggenhuber and Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, to the Council, on Schengen."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the representative of the Council presidency has not been welcomed by name, so I do not know whom I should be addressing at this moment."
"But I do hope that a representative is here."
"Mr President, in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on behalf of which I speak here, there have been serious concerns that the Council might not manage to arrive at decisions in time to incorporate the Schengen Agreement into the European Union and that the relevant legal instruments would then automatically become part of the third pillar."
"That is why the fact that this agreement has been reached and that the decisions have indeed been taken has been greeted with a degree of relief."
"That is the good news I am able to give the presidency."
"The bad news is that the way in which these decisions and stipulations were made has drawn heavy criticism and even protests from the overwhelming majority of our committee, and I hope that the House will share our indignation, because this is a very important matter in terms of parliamentary control and codetermination in the field of internal security."
"The Amsterdam Treaty itself dealt with the incorporation of the Schengen agreement, the institutional issues, the distribution of powers and the procedural arrangements in an extremely questionable and vague manner, namely by relegating these matters to an additional protocol."
"I do believe we must dwell on the significance of this line of approach in order to appreciate fully the nature of the criticism voiced by the committee and by Parliament."
"The incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the European Union is surely the most important and the most complex transformation of international law into the law of the European Union."
"It lays the foundations on which the freedom of the individual can be enshrined in EU law, it is the means by which the Union can become an area in which freedom, justice and security are guaranteed, and it is certainly the most significant increase of powers in the field of internal security."
"It is a transfer of power that will have a massive impact on fundamental rights and civil liberties."
"Let me ask the presidency of the Council at this point how the European institutions, and particularly the elected representatives of the European people, are to explain to the public that such a project can be implemented without involving Parliament, without informing or consulting Parliament."
"How are we supposed to explain that this Parliament has not even been accorded the right to deliver an opinion, that we have not even received detailed documentation and information about this scheme, and that we now have to discuss it without actually having been briefed on its details?"
"Allow me to voice the view of the absolute majority of the committee by saying that this is not only a matter of the rights of Parliament, important though they may be; one of the roles in which this Parliament has always seen itself is as the advocate of fundamental rights, of civil liberties, of personal rights in the European Union, and it is difficult to serve as the advocate of the European people if we are excluded in this way from Council projects, an exclusion which we believe is contrary to the letter of the Treaty; no doubt we shall have to agree to differ once again on that point, but in any event our exclusion is entirely contrary to the spirit of the Treaties."
"Perhaps I should also point out that the Council's approach once more raises the question of whether the theory of the Council's indirect legitimacy as a legislative authority stands up to scrutiny in the light of such occurrences, because the European Parliament is not the only legitimate representative body discussing these matters without the aid of documentation and being excluded from the Council's decisions and preparations; as we know, our national parliaments have been informed inadequately and at the last possible moment."
"In other words, we can no longer speak of genuine parliamentary control in the field of internal security, of police and judicial cooperation."
"That is the particular protest, the vehement protest, of the committee that I bring to your attention today, and it is not only on behalf of our committee that I call on the presidency of the Council to develop an entirely new culture of cooperation with Parliament in this extremely sensitive area of government authority and power in the domain of civil liberties and fundamental rights."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 May the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force, and on that date the Schengen system was incorporated into the European Union framework."
"The German Presidency has always regarded it as one of our foremost tasks to brief the European Parliament on the progress of the preparations for the integration of the Schengen cooperation arrangements, and I am pleased to have another opportunity to do so today, since the question of information and the form in which it is imparted has been such a crucial issue."
"Mr Voggenhuber, I shall also deal in detail with your comments on the subject."
"First of all, I should like to say a few words on the definition of the fruits of Schengen and their place in the EU framework."
"The discussions that are being held with a view to defining the substance of the Schengen cooperation arrangements and incorporating it into the legal bases of the EC Treaty and the Treaty on European Union have made good progress and are now very close to completion."
"The relevant draft Council decisions were noted and frozen by the General Affairs Council at its meeting of 26 April."
"Following yesterday's final deliberations in the Permanent Representatives Committee, the presidency is seeking the adoption of the decisions at the meeting of the ECOFIN Council on 10 May."
"I make no secret of our pride in the fact that the German Presidency has succeeded, in collaboration with its partners, in answering most of the questions relating to the place of the Schengen provisions, questions which remained thorny until the very end and which were affected by a vast range of diverse political considerations."
"The way is clear now for an extensive examination of the substance of Schengen, which is precisely what the Treaty of Amsterdam requires."
"It has not been possible, however, to reach an agreement on the place of the provisions relating to the Schengen information system."
"While a group of Member States has been pressing for the integration of these provisions into both the first and third pillars, a number of others favour incorporation into the third pillar only."
"A compromise position, which the presidency supports, proposes recourse to the third pillar as far as the establishment and operation of the Schengen information system and most of the notification categories are concerned, whereas notices of refusal of entry visas and the rules on system-related data protection would also have legal bases in the first pillar."
"Despite the best efforts of the presidency, a consensus on this point has proved impossible and there is no prospect of such an agreement on the horizon."
"In this area - and only in this area - the legal fiction in the Schengen Protocol, which provides for the third pillar to serve as the legal basis until further notice, will apply."
"This, incidentally, will not prejudice the adoption of the decision determining how the legal bases are to be split."
"I believe that this outcome, which has yet to be finally confirmed by the Council, is acceptable."
"For key parts of the substance of Schengen, it will prevent innumerable disputes regarding the legal bases on which future developments are to be founded."
"I should be exceeding my terms of reference if I were to deal with the legal bases of each of the Schengen provisions."
"But I must point out that, about a week ago, I sent you the drafts of the Council decisions, the aims of which are firstly to define the substance of the Schengen rules and secondly to examine that substance in detail."
"May I ask you to refer to those two documents for detailed information."
"Let me now briefly answer the question on the associated status of Iceland and Norway."
"The association of those countries with the implementation and development of the Schengen provisions will take place on the basis of an association agreement, which is due to be signed quite soon."
"Now that the Executive Committee of the parties to the Schengen Agreement has had its last meeting, held last week on 28 April, which means that the fruits of Schengen can be defined conclusively, it is also possible to identify the areas in which cooperation with Norway and Iceland should take place in the future."
"The discussions on this question are almost completed."
"The presidency expects that the Council will approve the agreement at its meeting on 17 and 18 May and that the agreement can be signed as part of the EEA Council meeting which is being held at the same time."
"At the heart of the association agreement is the creation, at all levels of the hierarchy of EU authorities, of a joint committee through which Norway and Iceland will play their part in the shaping of decisions."
"In the Schengen framework, these two countries have been directly involved in the work of the authorities, with the right to express their views but without formal voting rights."
"A direct transfer of this form of cooperation into the EU framework is not possible."
"The basic rule is that participation in the work of EU bodies is the sole prerogative of Member States."
"Other forms of involvement, such as observer status, would not have satisfied Iceland's and Norway's legitimate need to keep contributing to the discussion process on the subjects covered by the Schengen Agreement."
"This is why the two countries and the Member States have agreed on the creation of a special system of committees, the main aim of which will be to serve as a platform for the discussion with Norway and Iceland of proposals and initiatives for further developing the fruits of the Schengen process."
"The joint committee will only have very limited decision-making powers."
"These will be confined to procedural matters affecting the joint committee itself and its activities."
"Substantive decisions on the development of the fruits of Schengen, decisions which Iceland and Norway will have helped to shape, will be taken exclusively by EU bodies, namely the Council and, where appropriate, the Permanent Representatives Committee."
"In addition to the association agreement I have just described, the draft of which I recently sent to you, the Schengen Protocol provides for the conclusion of another agreement on the legal relationship between Norway and Iceland on the one hand and the United Kingdom and Ireland on the other hand in matters relating to their recourse to the benefits of Schengen."
"The negotiations on this have begun."
"I expect that they can be completed within a short space of time."
"Allow me to say a few words on the integration of the Schengen Secretariat."
"On 1 May 1999 the Council, acting in accordance with the written consultation procedure, decided to integrate the staff of the Schengen Secretariat into the Secretariat-General of the Council, and I hope that a line can now be drawn under the recent debates on this subject and that the presidency, the Member States and the staff of the Council Secretariat can turn their full attention once again to the substantive work that confronts us in the remaining two months of the German Presidency."
"In the course of the decision-making process, it emerged that some of the Council Secretariat staff are virtually taking to the barricades in opposition to the absorption of the Schengen staff, who have not gone through the customary selection procedure."
"I have no sympathy with that position, because the incorporation of former members of the Schengen Secretariat has nothing to do with nepotism or favouritism."
"On the contrary, it serves to safeguard the subsistence of a group of people who have shown great commitment over the years to the Schengen cooperation process and who must not suffer from the integration of Schengen into the EU framework."
"Moreover, the Union will also benefit from the specialised knowledge and skills of the trained Schengen staff."
"Let me finish by dealing with the consultation of the European Parliament on the transfer of the Schengen cooperation arrangements into the EU framework."
"The German Presidency recognises unreservedly that the transfer of the Schengen arrangements into the EU framework is of enormous importance to the future work of the European Parliament, and that Parliament has a legitimate interest in the various steps that have to be taken on the way to integration."
"Germany has always respected that interest by providing detailed information on developments in the process."
"Interior Minister Otto Schily, staff of the Federal Ministry of the Interior and I myself have briefed Parliament and its Internal Affairs Committee on several occasions."
"I might remind you that Mr Schily addressed the House on 14 January and that he spoke to the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs on 19 November and again on 30 March; I myself was at the meeting of the Internal Affairs Committee on 23 November, and Mr Eisel, who heads the other competent directorate in our department, has also briefed the committee twice during the past week."
"So I believe we have done all we could to keep Parliament and its committee informed."
"Nevertheless, I should also point out that we have no statutory obligation to engage in formal consultation on matters concerning the integration of the Schengen cooperation arrangements into the EU framework."
"The sole basis for the incorporation of Schengen is the Schengen Protocol, which makes no provision for formal consultation."
"The consultation requirements laid down in the Amsterdam and Maastricht Treaties do not apply to the transfer of the Schengen system."
"Let me assure you once again, however, that the presidency will continue to keep the European Parliament fully briefed on the state of the integration process."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement the Council has reached on incorporating the Schengen acquis into the Treaty is yet another of the sort of agreements that Parliament regards with extremely mixed feelings."
"Of course, it is wonderful that an agreement has been reached, which none of us dared hope would be achieved under the German Presidency."
"On 14 January this year, we adopted a resolution expressing our concern at the absence of an agreement, which would have meant that the whole of the acquis would have come under the third pillar."
"So the fact that an agreement has been reached is quite a feat, and I congratulate the German Presidency on it."
"The agreement also ensures that a considerable number of the provisions of the Schengen acquis , those dealing with the free movement of persons, asylum, immigration and border controls, are now mainly Community issues, which means that Parliament and the Court of Justice will be involved in policy in these fields in future."
"This too is to be welcomed."
"However, there are certain elements here that we find very hard to swallow because they are completely contrary to the recommendations that Parliament made in January."
"First and foremost yet again, Mr President-in-Office, there is the role that Parliament has played."
"It is true that the German Presidency held various discussions with Parliament and that we were kept informed throughout the period of the negotiations, for which we are grateful to the presidency."
"But you cannot deny that the final documents only reached Parliament on Monday, that Monday was the first chance we had to discuss the final outcome of the negotiations, and that the consultation of Parliament is really just a joke because everything has already been decided."
"A political agreement has been reached and simply needs to be confirmed by the Council on 10 May."
"You are quite right."
"Formally speaking you do not need to consult Parliament, but politically speaking this would not be advisable, since the choice of legal basis when incorporating Schengen into the Treaty will determine how the future acquis is to be developed and what the roles of the Commission, Parliament and the Court of Justice will be."
"So it is a crucial decision that directly affects Parliament's rights, which was why we felt we ought to be consulted, and consulted seriously."
"We even said in our resolution of 14 January that if this did not happen, Parliament would have to consider bringing a case before the Court of Justice, and I still think that the next Parliament should consider doing this."
"Mr President-in-Office, this is not a matter of injured pride."
"This is all about democratic control, because Parliament has a number of comments to make on the substance of the agreement too."
"First, the President-in-Office has himself admitted that there is no agreement on the Schengen information system."
"No agreement is better than just dumping everything under the third pillar, which would have been disastrous, but for the time being the Schengen information system is to remain under the third pillar, and this is a great mistake because the SIS contains a lot of data about immigration, asylum and visas, all of which are areas where enormous problems occur on a daily basis."
"So I would like to ask the Council what it can do to get us out of this impasse."
"Incidentally, the protection of personal data is a particularly important issue with the Schengen information system, and we should not forget that the Joint Supervisory Authority produced a highly critical report here."
"I would therefore urge that a proposal be put forward on the basis of Article 286 providing for an efficient supervisory body to be set up, together with a proposal for the protection of personal data under the third pillar, where there is as yet no such guarantee."
"Finally, I would also draw your attention to the Commission's right of initiative now on the whole of the Schengen acquis ."
"The Commission could provide considerable impetus here, but the Council in its wisdom has decided to keep the standing committee on Schengen implementation."
"This might have been justified if Schengen was to be extended, but it is unacceptable that this committee should be entrusted with monitoring the implementation of Schengen."
"I would therefore like to ask the Council for clearer information on this."
"It seems to be something of a curate's egg."
"All in all, I hope that this agreement will mean that both Parliament and the next Commission will be more closely involved in the policy areas that previously came under Schengen."
"Mr President, let me begin by expressing my delight over the incorporation of Schengen into the Treaty."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam secures free movement of persons throughout Europe, but we naturally want to avoid creating a free-for-all for those intent on crime."
"Priority must be given to protecting the public."
"With Schengen as part of the Treaty, more effective safeguards will be offered."
"Finding the appropriate technical solutions has nevertheless proved a very tough task."
"We in the European Parliament are understandably dissatisfied with the lack of parliamentary involvement in some areas."
"The Nordic countries have enjoyed free movement for a long time, and it has facilitated our relations with one another. Schengen will perform a similar service for the EU as a whole."
"It is therefore fortunate that the Nordic passport union will be protected."
"The Nordic group of countries is very vigilant when it comes to common Nordic legislation, the existence of which has meant so much to us."
"If Nordic and EU legislation were to clash in any particular area - and there are differing views as to the likelihood of this - then we would naturally need to ensure coordination."
"Iceland and Norway have been granted much greater authority in respect of border controls; they now share in the overall responsibility for monitoring the Union's external frontiers."
"Effective operation of the system is essential, which means ensuring that Norway and Iceland perform to the same standards as the EU countries on border controls and combating crime."
"The presidency has maintained a good dialogue with this committee on Schengen issues, keeping us informed of events."
"I nonetheless wish to draw attention to the provisions in the Treaty which state that Parliament must not be sidelined in the consultation process."
"As representatives of the people of Europe, we deserve to be much more involved than we have been to date in these matters."
"The role of the European Parliament has been too weak."
"And we have been given far too little time for deliberation."
"Translations of texts were sometimes missing, meaning that people could barely follow the proceedings in committee."
"This is no way to approach such issues."
"I therefore hope that the Council will today endorse the view that, in future, sufficient time must be set aside for proper consideration of these matters. We are dealing with sensitive questions and need to ensure that a real exchange takes place between Parliament and the Council."
"Mr President, this is the last debate we shall be having on European justice policy in this parliamentary term."
"When we started in July 1994, the Maastricht Treaty had just entered into force."
"We in the Liberal Group hoped that the Council of Ministers would be vigorous in tackling its responsibilities here, because combating large-scale international crime and fleshing out Europe's asylum and immigration policy are matters of considerable importance."
"When we now look back over this parliamentary term, we are forced to conclude - I am sorry to say - that the Council has made little progress."
"What has been achieved in these five years?"
"There are 500 000 displaced people in Kosovo, but does Europe have an asylum policy?"
"No."
"The Commission recently came to grief over allegations of fraud."
"Are the five fraud agreements in force yet?"
"Again, no."
"None of this is the European Parliament's fault."
"Here again we have often not been kept informed. When we were, we carried out our legislative duties as quickly as possible, only to find that the Council took not the slightest notice of what we said."
"I would say to the ministers and also to the officials - although I know that this is unusual - that they really need to change their attitude and their approach."
"Take Parliament seriously and stop rejecting everything so high-handedly."
"If we are honest, the Commission could also have played a more active role in this field."
"Some good progress has been made, but more could have been done."
"Schengen has now finally become firmly rooted in the European Union, which we have to admit is a positive development, even though Parliament was not adequately consulted."
"We will now want to take a closer look for ourselves at the decisions which have been taken."
"Finally, I regret to say that I cannot thank the Council on behalf of the Liberal Group for the work it has done during this period, because as I just said the results are far from satisfactory."
"However, I would like to thank Commissioner Gradin, who is unfortunately not here, and her officials, and I would like above all to call on the Council and the new Commission to make sure that the Tampere summit is a success."
"Mr President, the Group of the European Radical Alliance is very particular about issues of freedom."
"Schengen therefore remains one of our major concerns, both with regard to the freedom of movement of EU nationals and also with regard to freedom being indivisible for third country nationals who reside legally in one of the countries of the Union."
"In this respect, I think that we could perhaps ask the Ministers in the Council to insist that France ceases to abuse derogating clauses, particularly with regard to border controls between Belgium and France."
"To come back to my main point, I think that the Schengen Executive Committee has therefore been replaced by the Council."
"The Council presidency, proud of its newfound glory, has defined, regulated and established legal bases."
"It has established terms of association in splendid isolation, without consulting, and sometimes without even informing, the people's representatives, at least with regard to definitive texts."
"Parliament is clearly not satisfied with this attitude."
"We are once again in the position of having to request, no, demand, that the Treaty be respected."
"It is high time that the new presidency conformed to this fresh request."
"It is high time that we had a clear definition of police and judicial cooperation, and that we knew precisely who does what and in what context."
"The new Commission will have a lot of work to do in order to present a coherent plan at Tampere, and so that Schengen can bring about the area of freedom, security and justice that everyone desires."
"I have only one or two comments to make."
"It is a well-known fact that the People's Movement against the EU, which I represent, is opposed to the Schengen system, as I am myself, mainly for reasons of public security."
"I have no faith in claims that the construction of a supranational system of supervisory powers will benefit democracy in Europe."
"I presume that we all more or less wholeheartedly share the objective of establishing a humane refugee policy, but I take the view that democracy is best placed, as the Danes say, 'in the pockets of the citizens'."
"Schengen has been included in the Amsterdam Treaty and the opportunity has been taken to sneak Norway and Iceland into the system, whose people have voted against the European Union."
"By virtue of association agreements, they have something which in reality is equivalent to two thirds membership of the European Union without any influence."
"This is an absurdity."
"But now that the Schengen system has been created, I would far rather that it were kept under the third pillar, and for once I find myself in the situation of being able to praise the presidency for the exceptional lack of efficiency that is inherent in the administration of these rules."
"I would like to add that this Parliament is naturally interested in ensuring the maximum possible openness with regard to these decisions, a wish I fully support."
"The conduct of the Council in this respect leaves a great deal to be desired, whether the Treaty is interpreted one way or the other."
"Mr President, may I begin by saying 'well done' to the presidency."
"Schengen has now been successfully incorporated into the Treaty and we have a sensible balance between the first and third pillars."
"So the presidency certainly deserves our congratulations as far as the substance is concerned."
"Few people believed matters would be taken forward so fast."
"However, there is ample room for criticism with regard to the provision of information to the European Parliament and the inadequate use made of the expertise of this directly elected assembly."
"Clearly - as a previous speaker said - we need to distinguish between the formal and the political levels."
"Possibly the Council did in fact follow the existing consultation procedures."
"Probably this was the case, although we still need to cross-check."
"On such important political items as the incorporation of the Schengen acquis and the signing of an association agreement with two very special countries, I still believe that Council should have consulted Parliament and taken on board its views. That is where I feel the ministers slipped up."
"They came along to the committee and we talked. But Parliament could have been consulted; the Council would then have been able to receive our opinions in the form of reports."
"That is where the Council has missed out."
"I do not wish to dwell further on issues connected with the first and third pillars; instead, let me concentrate on the association arrangements with Iceland and Norway."
"I was surprised to hear what the previous speaker had to say."
"I happen to know that he lives in Helsingør;"
"I come from Helsingborg, four kilometres away."
"We both grew up on free movement."
"The benefits of such freedom, together with the existence of the Nordic passport union, have certainly had a marked influence on my life."
"I am delighted that we are now set to enjoy similar free movement with other countries too."
"The system has worked well for the Nordic area, and I am confident that it will work well for the European Union."
"And I am pleased that Norway and Iceland can also be associated in the agreement."
"It is somewhat rich that people should be criticising these two countries, when they are the ones behaving democratically and allowing their parliaments to decide."
"As far as I am aware, there will be a large parliamentary majority in favour - but no one's hand is being forced."
"It is up to the democratic institutions to take the decision on whether to participate in this cooperation process."
"Once the procedures have been completed, I am sure that Norway and Iceland will make the necessary legislative adjustments to bring themselves in line with the system."
"There should be no major problem here, nor with the Joint Supervisory Authority."
"The countries concerned will be able to make their voice heard, even though they will not have any formal decision-taking rights."
"Mr President, since I came to this House in 1994, Parliament has been very clear about the fact that the future of the European Union is at stake here, in this area bordering the third pillar, in this area of rights and freedoms."
"Since I came to Parliament, we have worked hard to broaden the extremely narrow limits of Article K.6 of the Maastricht Treaty."
"And we must acknowledge that, without doubt, these limits have been transcended, not only by including many of the issues that used to be under the third pillar in the EC Treaty, in other words, in the first pillar, but also by way of the relative progress made with Article 39."
"I must say that Parliament has played an important role in these advances."
"I believe that we must highlight the good and bad aspects of this issue."
"And I believe that we must be consistent and faithful and exploit this principle of faithful cooperation between the institutions. As a result, we must acknowledge what the Council has done and particularly the German Presidency."
"I naturally appreciate the work involved in drawing up a list of the Schengen acquis, as we all know that the Schengen acquis was a web of rules and a web of international public law, which complicated matters even further."
"Also, the presentation of this document on the legal bases of the Schengen acquis , which I have still not had time to study in detail, is clearly important."
"And together with the progress made, we must acknowledge and be aware of the difficulties inherent in integrating the Schengen Agreement into the framework of the European Union. It represents a closed world that is also being built beyond the limits of the European Union so that it can function."
"And we must also bear in mind that this is how it was born."
"Having said all this, Mr President, Parliament cannot remain motionless, for the reasons that have already been outlined."
"We have a duty to our people and it is extremely important where rights and freedoms are at stake. When the Schengen Agreement is incorporated into the Treaty on European Union, we must clearly give our opinion."
"It is true that, legally speaking, we have no rights, and on some occasions, not within this House but in committee, some speakers have suggested that this be taken to the Court of Justice."
"We have no formal rights; we are not protected by the Treaty. Yet, politically speaking, there is no doubt that we must be here, we must be informed and we should have been consulted on these decisions."
"That was not the case."
"It is not enough for the German Presidency to merely tell us what they have tried to do, and this must be very clear."
"To conclude, I should like to mention two aspects that the German Presidency has agreed will come under the first pillar: the protection of personal data and the issuing of visas."
"You are all undoubtedly aware that we must be especially vigilant on these issues."
"We also hope that the initiatives being taken, particularly by the Commission, will outline some clear future guidelines that will allow us to make progress at the next summit in Tampere."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs I am naturally pleased, along with all the other Members who have spoken, that there has been a successful outcome and that the presidency has been able to tell us that the Schengen agreement has now been integrated into the Treaty on European Union."
"However, we are still in the dark about the details."
"It seems that considerable sections of the Schengen acquis have been transferred to the first pillar, but the exact extent is difficult to determine at the moment."
"The Council is to blame for this lack of information, which is making it difficult for us to make any sort of assessment."
"The President-in-Office said that the Council had put in a lot of appearances here."
"This is true, we did see you quite often, but that is not the same thing as providing us with information or involving us in the decision making."
"None of that happened; despite what the presidency promised in March 1998, Parliament was not even kept informed."
"Parliament nevertheless has to do its duty and produce a legal and political assessment of the decisions the Council has now taken."
"I would like to ask you a few questions. What is the legal status of the section that has been transferred to the first pillar?"
"Does it take the form of directives or regulations?"
"We need to be clear about this if we are to avoid problems with any cases that may come before the Court."
"It unfortunately seems that none of the problems with the Schengen information system have been resolved."
"It has been put under the third pillar temporarily, but how long is 'temporary'?"
"The lack of clarity on this point is extremely regrettable, because if we agree to it we will be landed with an entirely unwelcome responsibility."
"Who is to monitor the operation of the system?"
"Who is to supervise it?"
"The Commission or the Schengen Executive Committee?"
"My final point is something Mr Wiebenga also mentioned."
"A great deal of decisiveness is still needed and there is still a large amount of work to be done."
"Commissioner Monti is to come up with a new proposal on visas as soon as possible after the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force."
"We are keenly awaiting an active asylum policy and the development of a series of instruments for determining violations of basic rights."
"The application of Article 286 of the Treaty is a good indicator here."
"Personal data are to be protected, along with the people to whom the data refer, naturally, and the European institutions are also going to have to comply with this."
"In short, we are happy with this outcome, which is better than nothing."
"But there is still an incredible amount to be done, hopefully in cooperation with Parliament once it has been properly informed."
"Mr President, on the involvement of Parliament and the transmission of documents, let me say again that the political agreement was reached on 26 April, and I hope you will appreciate that the documents could not be sent before then."
"As you know, we had to work right up to the last minute before managing to secure that agreement."
"We shall naturally continue our endeavours to reach an agreement on the place of the Schengen information system in the EU framework, but I am not very sure that this aim will be achieved before the end of the German Presidency."
"However, I should like to point out that, because of the automatic nature of the procedures laid down in the Schengen Protocol, the legal basis of the Schengen information system lies entirely within the third pillar."
"But this naturally means that the joint controlling body which has been monitoring compliance with the Schengen Agreement will continue to operate and will continue to ensure that data are being properly protected within the Schengen information system."
"As for certain provisions being assignable to the first pillar, Mrs d'Ancona, these are, of course, covered by individual provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty and have thus become integral parts of the Treaty."
"This, to my mind, is one quite palpable result that has actually been achieved."
"I should like to reiterate in general terms that, for all the importance of the results that have now been achieved, the real political decision consisted in the adoption of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"What has now taken place is the implementation of that decision."
"It is pleasing that this has been achieved with a fair degree of success."
"Thank you, Mr Schapper."
"I have received a motion for a resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Legal aspects of electronic trading"
"The next item is the report (A4-0248/99) by Mrs Oddy, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on certain legal aspects of electronic commerce in the internal market (COM(98)0586 - C4-0020/99-98/0325(COD))."
"Draftsmen (Hughes procedure): Mr Hoppenstedt, Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial PolicyMr Whitehead, Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection"
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights for the sterling effort they have made."
"I have put the staff and my colleagues under tremendous pressure to get this through in the May part-session."
"I would particularly like to thank the staff members who have had to work exceptionally hard."
"I would also like to say that my colleagues have been remarkably good-natured and entered into the discussion in a spirit of cooperation and good will."
"Because of that we have managed to complete the work on time."
"This is a very important area."
"Electronic commerce is a growth area."
"It should produce a lot more prosperity for the European Union."
"It is helpful to consumers and companies alike."
"Consumers benefit by being able to shop on the Internet in the comfort of their own home and enjoy home deliveries."
"It is quicker, simpler and consumers can do research on the market for the goods they want, much more simply."
"Companies benefit also by having contracts of major importance."
"It opens up the market across borders and gives consumers much more choice because it is easier to get goods - if you are British for instance - from France, Germany or Greece."
"But there are some snags."
"We need to ensure that the law we establish is clear, simple and that problems can be rectified easily."
"We need to ensure that consumers can be confident that they are not dealing with rogue companies and that when they enter their credit card number into the computer they will actually receive the goods and not find that the company has disappeared."
"In the vote in committee we put great emphasis on codes for regulating industry and for greater consumer cooperation."
"I feel this is important."
"Looking at the detail of the proposal, when you are trying to harmonise what is effectively contract law over 15 countries, that is difficult."
"The Commission was keen to ensure that it was clear when a contract was completed with a third click."
"The Legal Affairs Committee is concerned about that because is seems unduly onerous and it is more likely that mistakes might occur."
"On the issue of conflict of law, which is a horrendously difficult legal subject, we need to ensure that the rules are clear."
"I like the Commission's idea of having the certainty of home country law applying."
"This gives the advantage of simplicity and clarity."
"But again, we have to be aware that consumers need protection."
"A lot of the debate has turned on the subject of copyright and illegal material."
"We have to get a balance here between civil liberties, freedom of expression, people's freedom to put on the Internet what they want, no more official snooping on the Internet than there would be on the post or telephone, and balance the other argument that companies should not have people infringing copyright, infringing their logo, and pretending to be a company that they are not."
"It is a really big problem for well-known companies that other companies steal their designs and ideas."
"I feel we have just about achieved the right balance in the Legal Affairs Committee."
"Again, that is because of the good-natured discussion of my colleagues trying to reach a satisfactory, simple solution."
"The last point I want to flag-up is 'spamming', unsolicited e-mail."
"I do not believe that those consumers who want to ban all unsolicited e-mails are correct."
"I personally, as a consumer, like getting some on my interest areas like details of what is on at the theatre."
"I do not want it banned totally."
"I want the opt-out."
"Mr President, I should like to pay a very warm tribute to my colleague, Ms Oddy, for this report which characteristically she has taken through in the last days of the Parliament in a committee where there were other preoccupations and where there were immense legal and technical complications."
"It is not an easy subject and some of us feel that to bring this forward in the last few months of the Parliament when it needed considerable reflection and study was a little premature."
"Nevertheless, we have offered an opinion and I believe that Parliament's committees jointly have attempted to make sense of this difficult matter."
"I agree with Ms Oddy on two of the key areas she raised today."
"Firstly, the issue of country of origin."
"This makes common sense."
"I know some of the consumer movements disagree with me but the only rational way to trace out responsibility is to do it along this line."
"The second area where I agree with her is that in the issue of opting in or opting out we have to give the consumer the right to opt out, but to prescribe what may, or may not, be put on the Net is so to restrict the expansion of this traffic that we would have a harmful effect within the single market itself."
"We also have to be very careful that we strike a correct balance between liberty, on the one hand, and licence, on the other, between the world of private rights and the world of public obligations."
"The only area where I, and the Committee on the Environment, whose opinion I presented, differ from our friends and colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs, is on the issue of whether we have gone the right way in terms of consumer protection."
"In my opinion in some areas we have not."
"I do not believe that the amendment that seeks to bring broadcasting regulations into what is, essentially, a one-to-one transaction between individuals is right."
"We should vote down that amendment."
"We have also gone far too far to bring in some of the issues of copyright into this debate, where they have no place whatsoever."
"In my opinion, it would be far better to go straight down the line with the proposals that originally came from the Commission in this area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, electronic trade, e-commerce, is sweeping the world."
"The United States, Europe, Japan and even China are examining the realities of electronic commerce as well as focusing some of their attention on what, at the present time, remain mere visions."
"These visions are expected to become reality in two to three years' time, which, if the figures can be believed, would mean that by the year 2001 some 110 million PCS will be used for electronic commerce, generating a trading volume of 200 billion dollars - an enormous sum."
"It is easy enough to say that, but numerous questions remain unanswered."
"A great many of these are answered in the Commission proposal and in the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, and I believe that both of those bodies have done an excellent job."
"Allow me, however, to add in all modesty that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy also recognises its own opinion, delivered under the Hughes procedure, in parts of this report."
"The Group of the European People's Party and large sections of the Legal Affairs Committee therefore support the Commission draft."
"But we have had to agonise over some of the amendments, including those on the liability of intermediary providers."
"Three or four amendments from Mr Barzanti and one from Mr Glante fall into this category."
"I believe that these amendments undermine the structure and the logic of this entire report."
"For that reason, our group will be voting against them."
"One very important and very dangerous element is Amendment No 63, in which Mr Glante proposes reopening the question of exempting activities definable as broadcasting."
"In Article 1 of the television directive, we said very clearly what new services mean and how new services are to be defined."
"We also made a clear statement by saying that we want these new services to develop and that we shall discuss frameworks for the revision of the television directive again in the year 2002."
"It goes without saying that we in Parliament naturally expect the Commission to honour its pledge to hold a large-scale discussion of the implications for audiovisual services."
"That was one of the pledges which were made."
"When they will be honoured is not known."
"But I believe this ought to be mentioned here, since it was one of the balancing acts that were performed to secure our support for Article 1."
"The majority of our group will vote against this amendment, because they believe, as I do, that it is out of place here."
"The fact that the German federal states are pressurising the German Government to have services comparable to broadcasting, as they are called here, exempted from the rules governing electronic commerce derives from the internal situation in Germany."
"I believe that the public broadcasting system, which is certainly a staunch advocate of this amendment, really ought to trust the Commission and ourselves to continue the discussion of this matter."
"I have a request, which I have made in our amendment, that Annex 2 should be put to the vote in the form adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, because it is my view that the common market, the internal market, can develop better with this Annex 2 as we formulated it in the Economic Affairs Committee."
"That, of course, is consumer protection too."
"We can help by ensuring that benefits for consumers develop from the great struggle between conventional trade and the electronic networks."
"The shopping experience must be reshaped, and I believe we are progressing in that direction."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is essentially a good means of creating a minimalist regulatory regime in the field of electronic commerce."
"Ms Oddy's report also sets out a clear line of approach which accords with the spirit of the Commission draft."
"May I also express my sincere thanks to her for adopting the proposals made by the Committee on Culture."
"I should like to refer to one or two of these proposals."
"It is essential to guarantee freedom of expression in the new information services."
"The more open the networks, the greater will be the cultural diversity we can enjoy."
"At the same time, in the areas in which Community action is appropriate, the directive has to provide strong safeguards, especially as regards the protection of young people and of human dignity."
"The people of the Union will use the facility of electronic commerce to the extent that it proves useful in satisfying their everyday requirements in the real world."
"However, the Internet must be accessible to everyone."
"By ensuring that children learn how to use these new forms of technology at an early age and that training opportunities are provided for adults, we must prevent the exclusion of European citizens from the benefits of information technology."
"The connection between electronic commerce and medicines is a point I wish to address as a pharmacist and as a member of the Committee on Culture."
"For more than 30 years, medicines have been subject to a complex system of rules, which serves primarily to protect patients and consumers."
"Strict controls on the marketing, advertising and sale of medicinal products are in place at both the national and European levels."
"The Internet could invalidate some of these rules."
"There are misgivings about safety, the conduct of transactions, payment, the treatment of confidential information, the possible misuse of personal data, the quality of the products and the absence of expert advice."
"In order to protect patients, who are the consumers in this case - and I am thinking especially of our young people here - we must guarantee the application of Council Directive 92/28/EEC on the advertising of medicinal products for human use to electronic commerce in medicinal products."
"Mr President, this long-awaited directive enriches the European Union's impressive body of legal texts establishing rules for many aspects of the information society."
"This text certainly deals with one of the most sensitive matters; as clarified, completed and corrected by the Legal Committee, the directive definitely appears useful and acceptable."
"The point is not to overburden service providers with undue and unusual costs and unreasonable monitoring responsibilities."
"The limitations on liability provided for make up a simplified legal framework, while still recognising the serious problems which arise."
"I should stress that the list of liability limitations should be exhaustive, because this is the only way in which the directive really will lead to harmonisation."
"If, ladies and gentlemen, we wish to combat the rise in illegal activities, those offering on-line services need to be able to provide all the information required to trace and identify illegal content providers, whilst of course still complying with the provisions of Community law on the protection of personal data."
"We need to give those entitled the means to carry out surveillance, we need strategies to combat unlawful conduct, and we need to use notification and deletion procedures by means of appropriate electronic instruments."
"The directive does not aim - nor would it be able - to call into question what has already been achieved by the legislation on copyright and related rights, which was voted on a short time ago, nor - and might I point this out to Mr Hoppenstedt - is it intended either to apply to what is already covered and harmonised by the Television Without Frontiers Directive or to revise the definitions consolidated in the latter."
"The scope of this directive is separate and distinct; I do not think that anyone wishes to cause untimely confusion here."
"There is a fundamental distinction to be made between technologies, technical management of networks and the protection and promotion of contents and works."
"This is the major conclusion to be drawn from the long and intensive debate on the convergence of technologies and means of disseminating messages which has been on-going for some time."
"As I have said on previous occasions and will repeat once again, cyberspace is not a no man's land."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this my last speech as a Member of the European Parliament I mentioned the Television Without Frontiers Directive."
"This was the subject of my first ever report, back in 1988."
"If I were to seek a leitmotiv running through my modest yet steadfast and devoted work over the fifteen years I have been here, I think I would find it in my determination to help provide Europe, our beloved Europe, with effective instruments to guarantee pluralism of information, protection of creativity, support for the dissemination of European works and new momentum in audiovisual production, making the most out of irrevocable differences between cultures and transforming an apparent weakness into a strength."
"I would like to thank all those whose cooperation has allowed me to enjoy such a productive and unforgettable experience, and I do hope that these subjects will be given the time and attention they deserve and benefit from our Parliament's universally acknowledged determination and consistency."
"Mr President, I am taking the floor for the last time on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party to reply to Mr Barzanti, who has just spoken on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. I feel that I can but sum up, in one single sentence, what I believe many of us are feeling: we will miss you a great deal."
"I believe this institution as a whole will miss you a great deal as, of course, will all of us who have had the honour of working with you."
"We will miss you here although we hope that we will be able to continue to rely on your knowledge and your advice."
"Mr President, to move on to the substance of this directive, I believe that some of the more important problems it raises have already been discussed."
"This is a proposal for a directive that seeks to establish a difficult balance, a balance between service providers and those who provide the content, a balance between consumers and suppliers. In short, it seeks a balance between interests competing in the market, and all these interested parties deserve protection."
"Taking this as a starting point, I believe we must acknowledge the major task achieved by the European Commission."
"This involved knowing where to stop, as this directive is special in that it does not attempt to regulate everything, but what it does regulate, it regulates sensibly and with an underlying idea, one that guides and directs it. I believe that Parliament would be making a mistake if it were to alter these balances."
"As my colleague Mr Hoppenstedt has spoken on particular amendments in detail and because the PPE Group is well coordinated, all I can say as spokesperson for the group is that I agree with everything he said. I would just like to add a few clarifications, particularly on the subject of liability."
"The Group of the European People's Party will vote against some of the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights on the issue of liability, particularly Amendments Nos 45, 46, 47, 48 and 50 to 54. We will vote against them as we feel they upset this balance."
"Despite what Mr Barzanti said, which is a philosophy we fully agree with, I believe that they are of no benefit to content providers or authors in general terms. And in response to Mr Whitehead, there is little protection for consumers if we act in an arbitrary fashion when legislating."
"Therefore, and more specifically, it is meaningless to impose limits on service providers' liability for specific policies or specific activities. It is also nonsense to expect that they will, for example, be notified of this by the relevant authorities."
"To sum up, Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party supports the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs to a very large degree. It also supports some of the amendments tabled by the Liberal Group and, on the whole, except for the amendments mentioned by Mr Hoppenstedt and myself, we will vote in favour of these amendments in general."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Ms Oddy said, this report, which is the last of many on the information society, is the most important one of all."
"Contrary to what happened with the directive on copyright in the information society, we have managed - in just a short period of time - to conduct a more informative debate."
"Passion and zeal, rather than the search for new knowledge, tended to dominate those copyright discussions."
"I should like to thank Ms Oddy for her work."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights will miss her open-minded approach. She is very much her own person, and a creative one at that - even if we occasionally disagreed over my use of her mother tongue, English!"
"I do, however, endorse what has been said by those speakers who found the Commission's proposal more balanced."
"I certainly feel that to be the case with regard to the duty of surveillance, the question of technology, and neutrality in terms of different standards."
"My group will therefore be voting against many of the amendments on these points."
"However, I would like to ask for support from the other groups on the matter of a technology-neutral solution for signing up to agreements and contracts."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has improved the proposal considerably here, but there is still one noticeable shortcoming from my point of view. We are currently too obsessed with 'clicking' on buttons."
"There have to be other ways of concluding electronic commerce agreements."
"I now have an afterthought, a little late in the day."
"I suspect that, when we use the words 'electronic commerce', many people do not know what we mean."
"A better term must be found, since more than straight 'commerce' is at stake here. We are talking about issues of liability and the ground rules which will apply to the whole information society."
"Sadly, I have to note that even one's fellows forsake one from time to time."
"The proposal put forward in the Legal Affairs Committee on 'spamming' came from me, yet my group will be voting for an alternative proposal."
"The discussion so far nevertheless suggests that my idea stands a good chance of getting through."
"I honestly think that we would be making life far too easy for certain telecoms companies if we decided to adopt the amendment which has been tabled."
"I am sorry that it has come to this."
"Mr President, International Consumers' Day was celebrated in March, with the theme of electronic commerce and consumer protection."
"Commerce on the Internet does not in itself raise new problems of consumer policy, but since we are talking about a new medium, there is a need to establish security and confidence."
"Commerce using digital networks should be at least as secure and safe as commerce in the physical world."
"It is therefore unacceptable that the Commission's proposal should seek to put Danish consumers in a worse position in relation to commerce using digital networks than is the case for commerce in the physical world."
"One of the major problems with the directive is that it is the rules of the country of origin that apply."
"This will mean that countries with a high level of protection may risk being overrun with advertisements and marketing from firms and from countries which have a lower level of protection."
"The level of protection in the Nordic countries is generally higher than in other countries, especially as far as marketing in relation to children is concerned."
"This could result in distortion of competition, whereby foreign firms are able to use methods which Danish firms are not permitted to use under the Danish Marketing Practices Act."
"The background to the principle of using the rules of the country of origin is that it is too difficult for trade and industry to be familiar with every Member State's legislation in this area."
"But the consequence is that this burden is simply placed on the shoulders of the consumers."
"For the consumer, commerce on the Internet thus virtually takes on the character of Russian roulette."
"What rules apply, and what rights do we have if something goes wrong?"
"I support the amendments, which improve the directive, but I cannot support the text as a whole - and the June Movement cannot support the text as a whole - because it still takes the country of origin principle as its starting-point."
"Mr President, the need to ensure that European business remains competitive is one reason why the creation of a uniform legal framework for electronic commerce is indispensable."
"In this particular field, common rules are one of the main prerequisites for efficient commercial transactions."
"At the same time, due consideration must be given to the safety aspect and to protection from illegal activities and health hazards."
"Regular commercial abuse of the Internet is one of the unfortunate realities of cyberspace that cannot be ignored."
"Effective control mechanisms are therefore essential."
"On the one hand, the development of software for the recognition of illegal content must be supported with a view to ensuring that these controls are more than a token gesture."
"We must therefore forge ahead with the promotion of the necessary research projects."
"On the other hand, however, I believe we should also consider whether the only type of control that is likely to be effective, namely control by the provider, cannot be effected in future in a technically and economically expedient way."
"Public access to the information made available by providers would be appropriate in the light of the special responsibility borne by providers of online services."
"Let me conclude by dealing with a very specific problem."
"Among the possibilities opened up by the draft directive is the purchase of medicinal products without expert advice, which, as Mrs Heinisch said, creates a potential health risk that must not be underestimated."
"Moreover, the Internet offers opportunities for large-scale fraud at the expense of patients, as the WHO, along with other bodies, has repeatedly stressed."
"These things have to be borne in mind."
"Although the draft directive, when all is said and done, is a step in the direction of an Internet that would serve the best interests of society, there is still a long way to go before that aim can be achieved."
"Mr President, it is fortunate that we have you as President of the sitting in this House at the moment because this is one of the last reports, if not the very last, by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and you were a very efficient member of that committee for many years."
"At the moment, today's sitting has a rather nostalgic feel to it because we are reaching the end of this parliamentary term and some of our colleagues will not return. Others may perhaps return but, in short, the current Parliament is dissolving and at the moment there is a certain amount of nostalgia, a hint of twilight to this sitting."
"I should like to take this opportunity to point out that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has always been known for the great deal of internal work it does and for the high level of coordination within the committee. Above all, I should like to point out that our rapporteur, Mrs Christine Oddy, with her usual skill, has helped, and will always help, make our work easier within the committee."
"At the moment we are debating a directive on certain legal aspects of electronic commerce in the internal market. This directive attempts to harmonise certain aspects of the Member States' legislation, aspects which, in truth, are aspects of private law."
"I would say that we are dealing with an area where Member States seem rather small. This area covers the whole electronic commerce sector, the electronic activities sector covering everything from intellectual property to digital signatures and everything related to information services in general, including intellectual property issues."
"And not only do the Member States and the European Union seem small but also the world in general as, at a speed of three hundred thousand kilometres per second, borders have no real significance."
"If the European Union did not exist, we would have had to have invented it simply for this."
"With the fifteen or twenty or so Member States that will eventually make up the European Union, we cannot maintain different legal systems; rather, we must establish a full, specific and correct code. And, of course, I believe that, by definition, the principle of subsidiarity cannot be invoked at all in this field."
"When it comes to electronic issues, it is true that the beginnings of legislation are beginning to take shape precisely because of the major violation of privacy bringing computers into our homes may entail. On the screen, our children, our friends and our families may be exposed to a flood of information, which may well be unsolicited."
"I feel that we are currently exaggerating the cultural elements that set us apart within the European Union."
"In the European Union today, for better or for worse and despite national cultural traditions, the basic principles, the principles of law and order and the principles of the protection of morals, rights and minors still apply. I therefore believe that, at the moment, a directive such as this will make it easier to integrate our national legislations through the defence of certain principles that are common to all the Member States."
"Therefore, as a member of the Socialist Group, I should like to express my support for the proposal for a directive as proposed by Mrs Oddy."
"Mr President, in common with many other people, this is positively my last performance in this House."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur who I know has worked very hard on this proposal."
"It is a very detailed dossier, a heavily lobbied dossier, as I know to my cost."
"As always, when you have a heavily lobbied dossier one of the problems is that the lobbies cancel each other out, which demonstrates how Members of the European Parliament have to be able to cope with lobbyists, like they have to be able to cope with journalists."
"We must not forget, however, that this is a proposal from the Commission."
"I would like to congratulate the Commission on having produced a very practical text."
"Indeed so practical was it that I withdrew all of my amendments to some of the controversial Articles 12, 13, 14 and 15 and made a suggestion - which I was surprised they rejected - that colleagues like Mr Barzanti and others should withdraw their amendments as well."
"But as they did not the EPP will be voting against a number of amendments which were passed in committee."
"One in particular which I feel very strongly about is Amendment No 45, which was originally put in committee by Mr Barzanti, which would allow means of surveillance to be rendered operational on the basis of legislation or codes of conduct."
"I am very unhappy about that."
"Mr Barzanti told us that in his ten years here he has concentrated on European culture and protecting it."
"Fine."
"In 15 years here I have been dedicated to Europe being open to world trade and particularly to liberalisation."
"The Commission has put forward a liberalising proposal."
"It would be very unfortunate if the European Parliament were to appear to be less liberal than the Commission, bearing in mind that we are talking of a very high technology, fast-moving area where Europe is in very grave danger of falling further and further behind the United States."
"Mr President, I would like to talk about junk mail or 'spamming'."
"Junk mail through the post is an inconvenience but junk mail received electronically or by fax is actually charged to the telephone bill of the recipient."
"That is why it must be legislated for separately."
"I have received 42 pieces of junk e-mail in the last week alone and I can tell you it is a bloody nuisance."
"I have not personally received anything offensive but I know a number of my constituents have and 10 % of unsolicited e-mail is now pornographic."
"There are programmes available through which companies can harvest names from the Web and send out vast amounts of e-mail to companies."
"A report last year from Novell showed that junk e-mail has cost British and Irish businesses £5b a year."
"It also jams up the networks."
"We have legal cases pursued by Virgin Net in the UK and Bibliotech in the US, taking the fight against spammers to the courts."
"Last month 23 000 signatures on a petition were presented to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights of this House."
"They call for junk e-mail to be banned."
"The opt-out does not work."
"There is one in the United States."
"It has proved to be unworkable."
"I disagree with Ms Oddy."
"I believe it ill behoves us as legislators to legitimise a practice which allows advertisers to invite themselves to use other people's telephone bills and to use Internet provider infrastructure to pay for their marketing."
"There is every reason why an opt-in would work."
"It gives the consumers the opportunity to request marketing information that they want; it gives advertisers the possibility to target their messages to those who wish to receive them; it gives the Internet providers, who provide access to the Net, the possibility to continue to provide fast, effective and safe electronic e-mail."
"That is why my group is calling for support for Amendment No 70 to this report."
"Mr President, now that we can expect electronic trading to become increasingly important, a solid legal framework is needed which offers consumers adequate protection."
"This is the only way to make people confident enough to get involved in this form of commerce."
"At the same time, consumers must be able to protect themselves effectively against unsolicited e-mail."
"I also feel it is extremely important to protect those who are under age and to protect human dignity."
"It is also important to combat illegal activities on the Internet."
"I would like to ask Commissioner Liikanen whether the way in which the Committee on Legal Affairs has formulated this in Amendment No 48 is acceptable."
"Will this not be making Internet service providers into censors?"
"I have nothing against censorship, but it should be carried out by the police and the courts."
"Finally, I have to say that reading the amendments filled me with enormous respect for the Committee on Legal Affairs. Take for example Amendment No 23 on recital 22, which has an 88-word sentence that left me completely baffled."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important directive, and will play its part in building the information society."
"Christine Oddy's report is, in my opinion, a well-informed, skilful and excellent one."
"It is also important for us to ensure that, in enacting legislation, we do not create bottlenecks for businesses in this fast-growing sector."
"I believe, however, that the big problem with the Internet is the protection and freedom of the individual."
"The scale of the problem has not yet revealed itself."
"This is a historical stage in the process, one in which the global surveillance of people has become possible, and it is the first time civil rights have not been protected by international borders, as they used to be."
"In this respect we have entered a new era, and it must therefore be possible to opt out or opt in."
"I have also received junk mail, even in a language I do not understand."
"For some reason, a lot of it comes in Spanish from one particular sender."
"We must be able to put a stop to this."
"I cannot see how the police can take action, although that is what should be the case."
"I think the European Union needs to take action to create an effective, sound civil rights and protection movement in respect of the Internet."
"I would ask the Commissioner whether such a suggestion has been discussed."
"It would involve encouraging civil participation at European level, and protecting people's rights, in order to prevent this adverse trend from getting out of control."
"As a trading place it must be safe, because that is also in the interest of business."
"We must be able to locate criminal material, which should not have to be a job for the police."
"The post office, for example, looks out for a bomb, if one is suspected."
"The same should go for the Internet."
"When a third party sends information, that party can obviously be made liable for the bill, and liability should extend also to cases where a crime has been committed."
"Mr President, my colleague Mr Hoppenstedt has already done a very good job of explaining my group's position on Mrs Oddy's report."
"I thank Mrs Oddy for her report, but in the very heated debate that has developed on the subject of electronic commerce in Europe and the thorny issue of on-line content, its origin, its destination and its legality, I think I am justified in stressing that there must be room for freedom of expression on public networks such as the Internet."
"I would like to concentrate on an aspect which particularly concerns satellite providers."
"With regard to the responsibility of the on-line network service providers, the initial proposal from the European Commission distinguishes the responsibility of the various players according to what they actually do, without denying the problems of illegal content."
"In my opinion there is no point in amending this."
"In the transfer of information by satellite, cable or any other means, the network service providers, who are the intermediaries, are not the authors of the content."
"They may have to accept responsibility a posteriori for the information that they supply and they may also ensure that there is a priori monitoring at the request of national authorities, but in very specific cases."
"However, they cannot ensure permanent a priori monitoring of all the information - freely available on the Internet - to which they want to offer access."
"The network service providers are suppliers of technical services and do not have editorial responsibility."
"In a way, they play the role of the printers, which does not mean that they can print whatever they like, but their responsibility is not unlimited."
"The Web is an excellent tool for any firm or individual that wishes to make itself known, a tool that should be developed and not censored."
"Like my group, I will not vote for Amendments Nos 45, 46, 48 and 51, which have absolutely nothing to do with the issue and which would result in an impractical degree of censorship."
"Mr President, I too would like to address my remarks primarily to Commissioner Liikanen. Ladies and gentlemen, electronic commerce could be a tremendous boost to the economy and create a great many new jobs, jobs that Europe desperately needs."
"The proposed directive now before us will remove many obstacles and uncertainties and provide legal certainty and security for all those involved, particularly consumers."
"However, as well as the problem of 'spamming' which Graham Watson described, there is another problem too."
"Section 4, Articles 12 and 13 of the directive provide that where a service provider is only passing on information passively, it is not liable for the content of that information."
"So it is only operating as an intermediary."
"The same applies to the temporary storage of information on the Internet, known as 'caching'."
"Indeed, it appears from the explanatory statement to the Commission proposal that the restricted liability actually applies to all illegal on-line activities by third parties, such as unfair competition, misleading advertising and the pirating of copyright material."
"However, two months ago Parliament adopted an amendment to Article 5(1) of the copyright directive specifically bringing caching within the scope of the directive, so that it would be covered by copyright protection, yet caching as such does not involve any individual use of the information supplied."
"There is a contradiction here."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner something."
"These provisions contradict each other ..."
"The President cut the speaker off"
"I am sorry, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I have to cut you off because we are constrained by speaking time."
"I am very sorry."
"Mr President, I too should like to sing a form of swan song."
"For many years - although at different stages - I have been part of this House and I am now saying goodbye to it, not as far as my heart is concerned, as it will always be remembered there, but as far as my usual attendance here is concerned."
"I remember many moments in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and, among them, those shared with Mrs Oddy where we always reached similar conclusions on new technology issues that we began debating in the previous term with respect to their incompatibility with copyright."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Oddy and also my colleagues who have tabled amendments, for example, Amendment No 45, that my dear colleague Mr Cassidy is criticising."
"Mr Cassidy, I believe in freedom for men and women."
"We must be careful with devastating mechanical technologies that have no consideration for human nature."
"There is no reason why the network should eliminate the need for a certain degree of control, which is needed both for our children and for ourselves."
"Octavio Paz said that we are not made for a society whose aim is to produce to consume and to consume to produce."
"The fact that messages are sent to create artificial consumption is often distressing to a person, as pornography and other such things are. I believe that all this rubbish should be controlled."
"And I therefore feel that it is a good idea to have a certain degree of control at the centre of this network so that the consumer - which is first and foremost a human being - can tell where the problem comes from."
"If we control the network, we create a place for the law, and the law must, of course, be above mere technology."
"Mr President, forecasts suggest that, within just a few years, 500 million people will be on the Internet."
"A whole new market has opened up, as Mr Hoppenstedt has so eloquently argued."
"We have here a potential springboard for European growth, but we must avoid taking the kind of political decisions that might force Internet providers to locate outside the Union."
"In Amendment No 36, it is suggested that 'information society service providers must keep all information necessary for the purpose of tracing and identifying providers of illegal content.' This is a crime prevention issue, however, and responsibility for criminal matters lies with the country concerned."
"That is the approach taken by our competitor, the United States, and the same principle should apply here."
"The State bears the cost of crime prevention and takes the necessary decisions where there is suspicion of serious criminal activity. Very strict regulations and technical provisions may need to be put in place."
"If the proposal in Amendment No 36 were to be implemented, some Internet service providers would be forced to establish themselves outside the Union, which would not be the best way of utilising the growth potential of the new Internet economy."
"The net result would be a typical political fudge, based on a misguided attempt to reconcile various societal interests. Such an approach is born, in my view, of insufficient knowledge of the sector."
"The nominee for the office of Commission President, Mr Prodi, spoke on Tuesday of the importance of leading-edge technology for Europe's advancement."
"And he was right. It is essential that we build up, rather than undermine, the conditions for growth within the IT industry, particularly from the point of view of small and medium-sized companies, which need to be shielded from storage costs."
"Respect for the integrity of companies is also paramount, especially when they are small."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the development of electronic commerce will have a considerable impact on the whole of society."
"It promises to create added value, and therefore jobs."
"It is also a world-wide, global phenomenon, and it is unthinkable that we should be left out, as if Europe could be run as an island in the middle of the ocean."
"I therefore do not think that we should impose rules and constraints on ourselves that would mean placing ourselves on the fringe of this extremely rich field of development."
"However, I am well aware of the risks that it involves and they must be eliminated or contained."
"Having said that, I felt that in this respect the Commission's proposal was very well balanced."
"With all that I am hearing, seeing and observing, I am now wondering whether the amendments from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights have upset this necessary balance."
"As most of the speakers from my group have pointed out, I do not think that in order to protect consumers - a concern which is nevertheless quite legitimate - we should at the same time deprive them of all the advantages and all the benefits that this development can bring, both in employment terms and in economic terms."
"This is why I feel it is very important that we take great care to maintain this balance."
"This is why, along with my colleagues, I will vote in favour of certain amendments which aim to improve the situation, while on the other hand I will vote against others which I feel have upset the balance."
"Mr President, those who have been speaking in this Chamber for five years now should no longer feel emotional, but the thought that today is almost the last day of this parliamentary term does move me a little, to say the least."
"And since, as a famous writer from my country said, 'there is no certainty in the morrow', I shall take this opportunity to say good-bye and thank you to all the colleagues, officials and interpreters with whom I have shared these five years which have been so important for European integration."
"It has been an honour for me to work with many of you."
"The issue being discussed now is one of the most important of all in economic and social terms, both because it particularly relates to young people and because it can lead to many jobs being created."
"Yesterday Parliament voted on my report on the White Paper on commerce, which looks at length and in favourable terms at electronic commerce as well."
"I would also like to thank the Commission, which kept its pledge to produce the Green Paper and the White Paper on commerce within the same term of office, making sure that this sector was tackled comprehensively by the institutions."
"In the White Paper we managed to get the Commission to undertake measures to support enterprises and at the same time to protect end-users."
"The legal aspects analysed today are a vital foundation for regulating and harmonising electronic contracts and future use and developments, on condition that the Internet is accessible to all, accessible but regulated, so as to defend the groups at greatest risk, particularly children, to protect people from unlawful electronic acts and cable intrusion, but to encourage anything which can create jobs and help our culture to grow and flourish."
"There can be no Europe without culture, as the great President Delors reminded us."
"Even though much remains to be done in the new Community market, we have shown that it is possible to protect the interests of entrepreneurs and traders, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises, and at the same time to defend the public in their role as consumers, who are the target and focus of the work of enterprises, both public and private."
"Let us continue along this road!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, we live in the information age, and new channels of communication are constantly opening up."
"If we use them properly, they will present us with a vast range of opportunities which have to be grasped and which will enhance the competitiveness of European business."
"But we do need a uniform legal framework here."
"Internet users are bombarded with a barrage of online information."
"The Member States cannot rely on their national legislation, since there are no national restrictions on electronic commerce."
"For the sake of consumer protection, the Member States and the Commission must press for the development of codes of conduct."
"One very important point concerns unsolicited commercial communications."
"'Spam' must be clearly recognisable as such to recipients, who must also have a means of refusing it, especially in view of the costs they might incur by opening or downloading such messages."
"Greater transparency must be achieved in this area."
"Clear labelling of incoming messages is essential so that users are free to decide whether to avail themselves of the services being offered."
"Mr President, the Commission is glad to know that Ms Oddy's report, which is very thorough, shares the approach and the main lines of the Commission's proposal."
"It is particularly important as regards the unanimous backing of the internal market principles underlying the proposal."
"The majority of the amendments in Ms Oddy's report clarify and improve the original proposal and I am happy to indicate that the Commission will accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4, 6 - the latter in the English version only, 7, 12, 13, 16-20, 22, 24, 32-34, 37, 40, 41, 43, 55-57, 62, 65-67."
"Subject to redrafting the Commission is also in a position to accept Amendments Nos 3, 5, 11, 15, 25, 29 and 35 and part of amendments 9, 14, 38, 51, 69 and 73."
"There are, however, a number of amendments the Commission is not in a position to accept for one of the following four reasons."
"Firstly, because their objective and formulation is not sufficiently clear, which could lead to legal insecurity."
"This is the case of Amendments Nos 8, 24, 26, 30, 39, 58, 59, 60, 64 and 72."
"Amendment No 42 cannot be accepted as such."
"However, the Commission recognises that Article 11(1) concerning the moment at which on-line contracts are concluded needs to be reviewed."
"The Commission accepts the objective of Parliament's amendment to simplify the process of contracting and will address the question in the amended proposal."
"Secondly, because there would not be consistency with other Community directives or with Community law."
"This is the case of amendments which could be interpreted as being in conflict with the rules on the protection of personal data or with principles of Community law: Amendments Nos 10, 28, 36, 70 and 76."
"It is also the case of amendments trying to modify the scope of application of the directive in a manner which is not consistent with other information society service directives (Amendments Nos 27 and 63), and of Amendment No 31 changing the proposed definition of commercial communications."
"Thirdly, because they would upset the balance of interests on a number of issues that has been achieved in the original proposal."
"Amendment No 48 belongs to this group; there was a question on that."
"This is the case as regards the amendments on the issue of liability of intermediaries from 44 to 54 and 75."
"It is a very important sensitive area where particular effort was made in the original proposal to achieve a reasonable compromise solution that takes account of all interests at stake."
"It is also the case as regards Amendment No 71 narrowing down the list of contracts established in Article 9 of the proposal."
"Fourthly, because they would be too ambitious at this stage given the level of Community integration."
"This is the case of amendments aimed at narrowing down the derogations in Annex 2 of the proposal (Amendments Nos 21, 68 and 74), and Amendment No 61 concerning court actions, although on this last issue the Commission recognises that there is a need to improve the possibilities of redress, especially in cross-border contracts."
"I would like to finish by again thanking Parliament for its work on, and its support for, the proposal."
"It will be of fundamental importance for Europe and its citizens to fully reap the benefits of electronic commerce and to strengthen the European position in the global context."
"I agree with Mr Paasilinna that all non-governmental activities are welcome in this context."
"The debate is closed."
"Since it is the season for goodbyes, I shall now say my own."
"In particular, I should like to tell my colleagues in the Legal Affairs Committee how much I have appreciated the work we have done over the last five years, and to wish the committee every success in the next parliamentary term."
"Mrs Gebhardt has the floor on a point of order."
"Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to express my annoyance, and annoyance is too mild a word, because I think it is outrageous that a report which was scheduled for this morning - at least that is what I was given to understand when we voted on the agenda on Monday - should now be postponed."
"The report by a conciliation committee concerning the recognition of young people's vocational qualifications is a very important matter."
"As I discovered quite by accident this morning, the report is not to be debated until six o'clock this evening and the vote will take place tomorrow morning; this is not the sort of treatment that such a report merits, because it is about people, about young people."
"We in Parliament have said that this is one of our European policy priorities."
"I wanted to say that I do not accept the treatment meted out to this report, which is the product of extremely difficult negotiations in the conciliation committee and during the conciliation procedure with the Council."
"Mrs Gebhardt, Fridays are as valid as any other day of the part-session and as long as this is the case you should not assume the contrary."
"This matter was included on Friday's agenda by the Conference of Presidents a few part-sessions ago and has never been planned for any other time."
"You should have spoken to the chairman of your group to see if it were possible to schedule it for another time."
"In any case, on Friday mornings there is no special quorum requirement and we can vote on this matter quite calmly as no amendments have been tabled either."
"It is simply a matter of checking that there is consensus. Fridays are therefore just as valid and as important as any other day."
"Mr President, I should like to speak on a point of order."
"More specifically, I am referring to the order of voting for today."
"Reports that require a qualified majority are usually voted on first."
"More specifically, the McCarthy/Hatzidakis report on the general provisions on the Structural Funds should be voted on before the implementing reports, particularly before the Varela Suanzes-Carpegna report and the other implementing reports relating to the framework report on the Structural Funds."
"So, Mr Medina Ortega, what you are suggesting is that we proceed as usual and vote on the reports that require a qualified majority, in this case Mr Pronk's report, before voting on the group of reports on Agenda 2000."
"Mr President, I am referring to the group of reports including the Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, Jöns, Kellett-Bowman, Colom i Naval and McCarthy/Hatzidakis reports."
"The McCarthy/Hatzidakis report is the general report for these four reports and should therefore be put to the vote after the report by Mr Bösch and before the Varela Suanzes-Carpegna report."
"This is a simple question of the order of voting as this is the general report and the other four reports are the implementing reports."
"No, the usual order has been followed for these reports: first readings, second readings, assent procedures and consultation procedures."
"If we go into which report is the general report, it will all become extremely complicated."
"The order has already been established and changing it now would only complicate matters."
"Mr President, I am in the same embarrassing position as Mrs Gebhardt."
"I know that Friday is basically a day like any other: I am always here on Fridays."
"But you are setting a dangerous precedent, as Parliament needs to be given the opportunity to reject the results of a conciliation by 314 votes."
"That will not be possible."
"We have already done this once for the Rothley report."
"There had been a conciliation procedure, and we had agreed on the joint text, but Parliament rejected it."
"Tomorrow, Parliament will not be able to do that."
"I therefore protest, as we should have dealt with the conciliation reports this morning in order to be able to vote on them today."
"I am sorry, Mrs Lulling, but the vote on your report requires a simple majority and not a qualified one, otherwise it would have been included in the voting times today."
"That is why it can perfectly well be put to the vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, I was not aware that conciliations could be treated differently according to their subject."
"I do not think that this is the case."
"No, there is no question of treating them differently according to the subject."
"Also, the Rothley report was rejected by a simple majority."
"One needs to be properly informed before making comparisons."
"Mr President, let me come back to a point we discussed at nine o'clock this morning."
"As you will all have heard, Dr Ibrahim Rugova, the winner of our Sakharov Prize, has returned from Kosovo and is with his family in Italy."
"This morning, in your absence, we asked that the President and the Bureau should authorise a delegation from this Parliament to visit Dr Rugova in Rome at some time in the next few days."
"We suggested this morning that the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, Vice-President Renzo Imbeni and the head of the Delegation for relations with south-east Europe should travel to see him in order to find out from him how the situation looks in Kosovo, what has been done to him, and where things should go from here."
"We ask you to authorise this visit very soon so that we can make our travel plans today."
"Mrs Pack, as you and all your colleagues are aware, the Conference of Presidents is responsible for authorising this journey."
"The Conference of Presidents is meeting this afternoon and I will put this request to them and recommend that it be approved."
"The competent body will therefore take a decision this very afternoon."
"Mr Falconer wishes to speak on a point of order."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"Can you advise me as to whether those people who have telematic lenses have the Bureau's permission to take pictures from the gallery?"
"Have they been granted permission to take these pictures?"
"This point was raised at the last part-session and those people were removed from the gallery, as is only proper and right."
"Mr Falconer, Parliament's services tell me that the photographer who is taking photos has been expressly authorised to do so and is therefore wearing a badge that shows he has been granted permission."
"Therefore, if our relevant services have authorised this, it is because it is permitted in the normal run of things."
"Mr President, I do not agree with your interpretation of how we take the vote on the structural fund programme, because the general regulation is actually the regulation governing every other aspect of the implementing regulations."
"If this House does not give assent to the general regulation, there can be no agreement for the regulations that follow on from it."
"In terms of legislative logic you need to take the general regulation first, even though that involves only assent, and take the regulations thereafter."
"All you need to do is swop McCarthy and Hatzidakis with Varela Suanzes-Carpegna and then we can follow on logically."
"Mrs McCarthy, I do not see that there is any difference, but so that we do not waste any more time, we are going to vote as you requested. This will stop us using up any more time in a meaningless discussion."
"VOTES"
"If the amendment is adopted, that will be done."
"Before we proceed to the vote and pursuant to Rule 72(5), I would ask the Commission to make known its position on the amendments."
"Mr President, the amendments agreed by the Council, the Commission and your representative, Mr Varela, will be adopted."
"Mr President, the Council also accepts the amendments as agreed."
"The President declared the common position approved as amended"
"The answer is the same as before."
"What was jointly agreed and what was stated yesterday in the debate by Mrs Jöns has the emphatic support of the Commission."
"Mr President, my position is identical to that of the Commissioner."
"The President declared the common position approved as amended"
"Mr President, I should like to draw the attention of the House to a necessary addition."
"During the conciliation process and the trialogue, we agreed that the text of Amendment No 2 on Article 1(2) must henceforth read: 'this limit may be increased up to 2 %'."
"The same agreement applies to Amendment No 1, relating to recital 4."
"In the text before us, however, the word 'up' has only been inserted once."
"May I ask you, once we have voted, to make that adjustment, so that the word 'up' is also inserted into Amendment No 1."
"That is what was agreed between the Commission and the Council."
"Does the rapporteur agree?"
"Very well."
"I would then ask the Commission and the Council to make known their position on the amendments."
"Mr Liikanen has the floor for the Commission."
"That is correct, what Mr Samland said."
"The Commission agrees."
"And the Council also accepts the amendments?"
"The Council is also in agreement, Mr President, as established at the trialogue."
"The President declared the common position approved as amended"
"Mr President, prior to the vote on this subject, there were discussions in the House on the question of the majorities that would be necessary for us to adopt the new interinstitutional agreement and the associated financial perspective."
"I know that you also enlisted the aid of the legal services to try and clear up the situation."
"On behalf of the members of the Committee on Budgets, I should like to make the following statement. Until the present time, the standard practice of this House has been to decide on interinstitutional agreements by a qualified majority."
"This means that we reach an agreement on the basis of the last sentence of Article 203(9) of the EC Treaty, which states, in connection with the maximum rate of increase, that 'another rate may be fixed by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, and the European Parliament, acting by a majority of its members and three-fifths of the votes cast'."
"You know as well as I do that neither the Treaty nor our Rules of Procedure - not even the new Rules - regulate the question of voting on interinstitutional agreements."
"In this interinstitutional agreement and in the financial perspective, however, we are fixing the maximum rate of increase for the next seven years."
"We are thus indirectly taking a decision for which the Treaty explicitly prescribes an absolute majority."
"Not only for that reason, but also because of the political need for such a decision to be utterly binding on the Council and the Commission and on Parliament too, I would therefore ask that we proceed on the assumption that this vote requires a qualified majority."
"May I ask you to confirm that?"
"Thank you very much, Mr Samland."
"I cannot confirm what you are saying."
"I have in fact examined the report by the Committee on Budgets in great detail and I have asked the Legal Service to give its opinion."
"As mentioned in the note your committee sent - which I have examined in great detail - and as you have indeed said, it is not stated either in the Treaties or in the Rules that interinstitutional agreements require an absolute majority."
"What is more, as you are all aware, a past ruling by the Court of Justice from 23 July 1988 states that the majorities required for a decision cannot be stipulated by each institution."
"This was what forced us to replace in our own Rules the absolute majority, which was used to grant discharge, with a simple majority instead."
"We came to the conclusion that it was not possible to maintain an absolute majority system when it was not enshrined in the Treaties."
"This would be an appropriate argument in this instance."
"Along with the Legal Service, I have also examined the argument you have put forward on whether or not this decision in itself covers budget decisions, in other words, whether or not it covers budget decisions which, according to Article 272, require a qualified majority."
"I agree with the Legal Service's conclusion that it does not cover budget decisions because the agreement is neither a rule nor a budget decision in itself."
"Each year, when the budget is adopted, the President must verify that a sufficient majority has been achieved and has been taken into account."
"Then, when the annual budget is adopted, the decision is taken with these majorities."
"And you may take a decision that is theoretically contradictory not to reduce certain lines, even though the institutions may have adopted the agreement among themselves. This agreement does not have the force of law and is below the law."
"However, it is an agreement that is based on the goodwill of the institutions and it has no regulatory value."
"As a result, we cannot demand a qualified majority if the agreement has no legislative or budgetary value."
"And there are rulings by the Court of Justice that confirm this point, which are also quoted in the Legal Service's report which I will make available to you."
"Therefore, taking all these factors into account and to avoid making a mistake that might mean we could be brought before the Court of Justice and then lose - as has already occurred on a previous occasion - there is no other solution but to adhere to the Legal Service's criterion, which states that this vote requires a simple majority. It will therefore be decided by a simple majority only."
"Mr President, I naturally agree with those arguments since, on the basis of my own examination, I expressed them this morning and yesterday in the Group of the European People's Party."
"I would like to remind Mr Samland, who used a political rather than a legal argument, that this House has often called on the Council to do away with unanimous and qualified majority voting and to adopt agreements by a majority."
"It is a strange political move to ask the Council to do something that we apparently do not wish to respect. This goes against the Treaties, our own Rules of Procedure, the case-law of the Court of Justice and even common sense, which tells us that, in legal terms, an act is an act and only has the value of that formal act."
"It does not have the value of its consequences, which do indeed exist but which will eventually have an appropriate legal form, with the majorities required by the Treaty."
"I will not go into political criteria."
"The President must act in strict accordance with legal and regulatory criteria."
"Mr President, first of all thank you for that clarification: we must deal with things on the basis of the law and from a legal point of view."
"We have to be very careful, because if we act on the basis of political considerations, we change everything, we can keep contradicting ourselves."
"We have already seen that this week."
"I think that we need to take this fact into consideration: interinstitutional agreements alter budget annuality, by agreement of the institutions, and they are an integral part of a vision of the budget that we have accepted by mutual agreement."
"In the Colom i Naval report, one paragraph and also Amendment No 27 directly relate to Article 12 of the interinstitutional agreement, an article which alters the maximum rate of increase for the duration of the seven year period."
"This is an extremely significant and extremely strong act on the part of this institution."
"Paragraphs 8 and 9 of Article 3 in Annex IV of our Rules of Procedure require an absolute majority of Members."
"I think that Mr Samland's objection is well founded."
"We are protecting ourselves from the Council by demanding that there should be an absolute majority."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to endorse the line of argument advanced by Detlev Samland and to add the following comment: the case-law you have quoted, Mr President, derives from a judgment which states that the institutions may not relax the provisions on required majorities which have been adopted in the Treaty."
"This does not, however, mean that the institutions are not autonomous enough to decide to increase the required majority in a particular situation, for example in order to enhance the binding effect ascribed to the maximum rate of increase in Article 203."
"This is a further argument in favour of the position taken by the Committee on Budgets."
"We are making a change here and are fixing the maximum rate of increase for the next seven years."
"The House would do well to ensure that this decision carries the support of a qualified majority."
"Mr President, I should firstly like to note that, according to what you are saying, the Legal Service and the President made a mistake in 1988 and 1993 because, by following the Legal Service's report at the time, it was understood on both occasions that a qualified majority was required and it was put to the vote in that way."
"But what concerns me now, as I would of course be prepared to correct the error, is your own interpretation of the issue, Mr President."
"This is because the agreement we are voting on, as it stands at the moment, provides for the revision of the financial perspectives themselves by qualified majority."
"According to the opinion you have expressed, this act would be null and void and would be at odds with the 1988 decision you mentioned."
"Therefore, we could not adopt an act which, from what you are saying, is invalid according to the July 1988 decision."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to pay tribute to Mr Samland, who we know is in favour of the interinstitutional agreement, and who puts concern for the law and for the political authority of interinstitutional agreements before any other consideration."
"Mr President, if your interpretation is correct, the interinstitutional agreement is inadmissible because it contains a whole series of provisions which require a qualified majority."
"If the Treaty really does have to specifically require a qualified majority on every occasion, and limit the cases in which the qualified majority can be extended, then this interinstitutional agreement is inadmissible, as Mr Colom i Naval has just said."
"It is void, and you must withdraw it."
"On a more fundamental level, I think that the main issue in this matter is that this Parliament, on its last day, intends to bind its successor and its successor's successor to a fundamental limitation of the budgetary powers laid down in the Treaty, budgetary powers which this Parliament mainly exercises by qualified majority."
"It is totally unreasonable and contrary to the Treaty to make a decision by simple majority, as the Treaty states that we have budgetary powers and that we exercise those powers by qualified majority."
"We cannot constrain the next Parliament and prevent it from exercising its budgetary powers by a simple majority agreement."
"I would like to add that this agreement follows on from the institutional agreement of 1993, which was agreed by qualified majority and which explicitly states that it can only be revoked by qualified majority."
"This new agreement implies the former agreement being revoked and replaced and it must therefore be passed by qualified majority."
"In short, Mr President, at the meeting point of the political and the legal, I think that you are grossly under-estimating the significance of the emergence of interinstitutional agreements in our system."
"In ruling after ruling, the Court of Justice, which you cited, is increasingly recognising interinstitutional agreements as fundamental rules."
"What you are doing - if you pass this law by simple majority - will mean that, tomorrow, on a misty Friday morning, with a majority of 48 votes to 47, a makeshift Parliament will be able to abolish and destroy not only the financial perspectives, but the entire structure of interinstitutional cooperation that has been put in place over the last twenty months."
"Applause"
"You do not have the right, Mr President, to wipe out in this manner something that is one of the foundations of sound interinstitutional operation, namely these agreements which have been drawn up gradually and confidently by the institutions."
"We must vote by qualified majority."
"Loyal cooperation between the institutions is at stake, as laid down in the Treaty and recognised by the Court."
"Loud applause"
"I have many requests for the floor but I do not believe that we are here to hold an academic debate; we are here to vote."
"Someone must decide, and this responsibility falls on my shoulders."
"I have studied the matter in detail and I am terribly sorry, Mrs Müller, but our case-law states exactly the opposite of what you are saying: it states that we cannot increase majorities."
"It is not that we cannot reduce them but we cannot increase them."
"And therefore, where there are none, we cannot establish any."
"This is unfortunately how it stands, despite the fact that Parliament is sometimes under the illusion that it may be otherwise."
"On the basis of this decision, I have no other alternative but to stick to the criterion that had been reached."
"And we are going to vote by simple majority."
"Let us consider the motion for a resolution."
"No, Mr Elles, this issue has been dealt with."
"I am terribly sorry."
"If anyone asks me in writing, I will pass this matter on to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure for future reference. But at this moment in time, someone must decide."
"It is my responsibility and I have decided. There will be no vote on this issue."
"Mr President, before we come to the vote on the revised Amendment No 27, I would like to question its admissibility."
"As this amendment establishes the adoption, in the form of an annex, of a draft interinstitutional agreement, I do not think that it corresponds - either legally or in practice - to what is expected in that context."
"When we have had to vote on interinstitutional agreements, we have had a report and we have had the approval of the interinstitutional agreement, which was proposed in the report."
"I am not arguing about issues of majority."
"I expressed my position concerning the interinstitutional agreement on the CFSP, and my position has not changed."
"However, we are talking about adopting the text of an agreement - one which considerably alters several parts of the report, albeit only a few paragraphs apart from the explanatory statement - by means of an amendment, following a report which has a different title: I do not think that this amendment is admissible."
"Moreover, you took this position in a relatively similar context concerning an amendment that I had tabled myself."
"Mr President, at its meeting on Monday, which was authorised by you and was properly convened, the Committee on Budgets took its basic decision on the adoption or rejection of the interinstitutional agreement."
"A majority of the committee voted for adoption."
"Since we could not vote before Monday on the resulting amendments and since you had specially authorised us to meet then, because the trialogue at which we negotiated the outcome with the Council only took place last week, the committee adopted the relevant amendments immediately after voting for the agreement."
"These amendments were properly adopted and were presented to the House within the prescribed time-limit."
"In that respect, the House is behaving absolutely correctly by proceeding to the final vote now."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, the truth is that I see no precept in the Rules of Procedure that prevents us from proceeding in this way, just as we have done so many times."
"In other words, we can include a related text with an amendment."
"Therefore, I will now put Amendment No 27 to the vote."
"Mr President, forgive me for taking the floor again, but before the final vote and pursuant to Rule 129 of the Rules of Procedure, I would like to propose that the Colom i Naval report be referred back to committee."
"I think that the discussion that has just taken place, the arguments that were put forward and the conditions in which the vote took place are all arguments in favour of a referral back to committee."
"We would therefore be able to leave the next Parliament to decide, immediately after it has been elected, what is going to happen in the next seven years."
"Meanwhile, we will have the opportunity to broach the legal question raised by several speakers, which Jean-Louis Bourlanges explained brilliantly a moment ago."
"I therefore propose to the House to vote for the Colom i Naval report to be referred back to committee."
"Very well, we shall discuss that with one speaker in favour and one against."
"You were in favour."
"Mr Samland is against, I think."
"Mr President, for two years we have been discussing this report in committee - yes, for two years!"
"We have presented more than twenty working papers on it."
"At Monday's meeting of the Committee on Budgets we had another four-hour debate, in which Mr Fabre-Aubrespy chose not to participate."
"Yesterday we discussed this report comprehensively here in Parliament."
"So with all due respect, we can support the report or oppose it, but any move to refer it back would truly be a slap in the face for the rapporteur and the House after all the work they have done."
"I move that we proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, we heard yesterday evening in the debate on this report that our rapporteur himself is not in favour of this particular report."
"We have had votes this morning, under the new Amsterdam procedure, in which we have not been able to take individual amendments like Amendment No 28 which would call for a review clause for this perspective which extends - as some speakers have already said this morning - over seven years without any review."
"There will be no possibility for a new Parliament and a new Commission to have their say on the matter."
"I therefore support the suggestion of Mr Fabre-Aubrespy to send it back to committee."
"We are in the process of negotiating."
"We can clarify what is in Parliament's interests."
"I fear that if we take this final decision now, Mr President, you will be left with a kind of feeling that you have been acting on behalf of interests outside this House and not the interests of Members themselves."
"Murmurs of dissent"
"We are going to vote, Mr Elles."
"I am the only interpreter of my own sentiments."
"You have no knowledge of them."
"Parliament rejected the request for referral back to committee"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I move that the vote be postponed until tomorrow morning at the earliest, but preferably until September, because the draft still contains two legal defects."
"Firstly, it remains unclear whether the Committee of the Regions has been given a role to play."
"I personally find it hard to comprehend that the Council should be presenting us with its amended position before it has consulted with the Committee of the Regions to clarify the role it intends to assign to the Committee."
"That is an unacceptable error of law."
"Secondly, this morning it was still impossible to obtain the correct version of my report from the distribution counter."
"The version that was available there this morning for the second reading still indicated the wrong legal basis, namely the Maastricht Treaty."
"May I ask you, Mr President, to postpone the consideration of this report until tomorrow at the earliest and to instruct your legal services, which have already been working on this since Monday, to check that the text on which we are to vote contains no errors of law and that it is available tomorrow from the distribution counter."
"Mr President, I have great admiration for Mr Jarzembowski, and in particular I admire the tenacity he shows in pursuit of his objectives."
"Having failed to achieve them through the content, because we rejected all his amendments by a large majority in committee, he is naturally trying the legal route, and I certainly have no problems with that."
"The only thing is that the legal situation has been unequivocally clarified, by your legal services for example."
"We have also proceeded in the manner advised, recommended and urged by Mr Jarzembowski himself in the committee, and even confirmed the first reading in committee."
"These matters have been thoroughly discussed, Mr President;"
"I consider it right and proper that we should vote on this today as you proposed. I would ask you to stand by your view and take this vote today."
"Mr President, I support Mr Jarzembowski's motion for referral back to committee, not only because of his legal argument, which is correct, but also so that the next committee can come up with something better than Mr Jarzembowski managed this time!"
"Laughter"
"One possibility would be to adopt the report now and postpone the vote on the communication to the Council until the Committee of the Regions decides whether or not it will give its opinion on the matter. Another possibility would be to postpone the vote until tomorrow as it seems that the Committee of the Regions may give a favourable opinion tomorrow."
"Mr President, I was in the Chair on Wednesday evening when this debate took place, and I arranged on Wednesday evening for a check on whether the vote would be held today or not."
