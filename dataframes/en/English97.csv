"Europe needs to step in here with practical, properly funded programmes to enable health professionals to do the work they were trained for in their own countries, under proper conditions and within proper structures, with the necessary equipment and medicines."
"Lastly, combating AIDS in the long term will require a firm commitment to give patients in developing countries access to the medicines they need at prices they can afford."
"Given that many AIDS patients in the southern hemisphere have already developed resistance to the first-generation drugs they have been treated with, it is essential to find ways of making the latest treatments available in generic form in low-income countries."
"For that reason I would ask the Commission specifically to ensure that bilateral and regional agreements currently being negotiated - especially EPAs - do not include any provisions that might make it harder for southern hemisphere countries to use all the flexibility available under the TRIPs agreement and the 2001 Doha Declaration for the purpose of protecting AIDS patients."
"I have no more to say."
"The unacceptable situation of millions of people dying of AIDS every year demands that the European Union face up to its responsibilities."
"It is time to stop talking and to get to work."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I shall be brief, because I understand we are under pressure of time."
"I just wish to make three or four points."
"Firstly, this is a problem that affects the whole population and this is the message we try to convey."
"It is no longer a question of risk groups and that the rest of us need not worry: it is an issue for the general population - young people, women."
"We must raise awareness about this, and the political message has to go through as well."
"In particular - because it was mentioned - on the issue of immigrants we take a particular approach."
"The Portuguese Presidency had the issues of health and immigration as a theme of its Presidency, and access to treatment, testing and treatment and healthcare of the immigrants - even undocumented ones - is an important aspect."
"This is something we are discussing not only for their protection and the human rights aspect of it, which, of course, is a priority, but also for the protection of society as a whole."
"The issues that were raised, such as the possibility of the exchange of needles for drug-users, promoting condoms, sexual education in schools, the problems in prisons, are all part of our discussions with the Member States and the civil society."
"We have a think-tank where everybody is involved: they have discussions and exchange best practice and experiences."
"But, of course, within the European Union we realise that we do not have the competence: it is the responsibility of the Member States to implement these policies."
"Therefore, we raise the profile at a political level, we hold discussions at technical level but, at the end of the day, it the responsibility of the Member States to take specific initiatives."
"On the other issues raised by Mr Agnoletto, I have taken note with great interest of the issue of TRIPS."
"I have noted that and also the effect it would have on access to medicine in developing countries and all the other issues he raised concerning dealing with countries outside Europe."
"I will raise them with my colleagues who are responsible for these particular areas and I will inform them of the points raised by the honourable Member."
"Finally, when it comes to access to ARV within the European Union, initially - and then hopefully we can extend it to other areas - we are supporting very actively the initiative of the German Presidency after the Bremen Conference to achieve access to cheap and affordable ARV treatment for all patients and those who need it."
"We already have, if one can call it that, a first success story with Bulgaria."
"But, of course, we will pursue it in the Presidency, with the support of the Commission, and hopefully once the model is established we can extend this approach outside the European Union."
"We always have this as a target."
"Once again, I should like to thank the Members for a very interesting debate and I have taken note of all the issues raised."
"The debate is closed."
"Shipping disaster in the Sea of Asov/Black Sea and the subsequent oil pollution (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the shipping disaster in the Sea of Asov/Black Sea and the subsequent oil pollution."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to say that my colleague Mr Dimas regrets not being able to be here today for this debate but, as you know, he is at the global warming conference and he has to represent the Community there."
"This is a very important issue."
"We know that heavy storms in the Black Sea region in November caused a tragic loss of life and property and of course damage to the environment, with an estimated leakage of 1 300 tons of fuel oil and the sinking of ships carrying sulphur."
"Under a bilateral agreement, the Commission sent a team of five EU experts, who were joined by representatives of the Commission and the UN Environment Programme."
"The EU experts found Ukrainian clear-up operations well underway."
"Locally available technologies and resources were considered sufficient, and Ukraine expressed no need for additional emergency equipment."
"The key results of the mission will be presented to the Ukrainian authorities in Kiev on 14 December."
"During that meeting discussions will also focus on further strengthening cooperation with regard to improvements in the monitoring of the environmental quality of the Black Sea."
"According to international oil spill statistics, the current oil spill can be considered of medium size and is not expected to be a major environmental disaster."
"Of course, that does not mean that we are not just as concerned, in particular because there is always the possibility of secondary pollution."
"The density of the environmental pressures, the presence of sensitive species in the strait, the political sensitivity of the area and the risk of further, similar accidents in the future all underline the need to assess the situation in a more comprehensive manner."
"The European Commission is therefore considering follow-up through other instruments such as post-damage assessment missions, so I am looking forward to the debate on this issue."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, today's opportunity to discuss last month's Black Sea disaster is very welcome, for at least two reasons."
"The first is that, with respect to many countries, including Russia, the European Parliament has a role to play as a substitute for public opinion."
"Imagine what would happen in the European mass media if a similar disaster occurred, let us say, in the Baltic."
"The television would regale us with pictures of damaged flora and fauna for days on end."
"We would be subject to an onslaught of experts explaining the ominous effects of the disaster."
"In Russia, however, the media are silent."
"Only with great difficulty was I able to gather a few scraps of information, mainly from Ukrainian sources."
"Our voice, therefore, is exceptionally important in this matter."
"The second reason is what I would call broadening our European awareness: the awareness that regions to which we have hitherto paid little or no attention, like the Black Sea, are an integral part of our continent, not only in the geographical sense but in terms of nature, ecology, economics and culture - the awareness that we are parts of a common whole and that those parts affect each other."
"Such awareness should increase our sense of responsibility, which should also extend to the Black Sea region."
"Our responsibility entitles us to demand that the Black Sea basin be made much safer than hitherto."
"It should be mentioned in passing that disasters on a smaller scale have occurred several times in the recent past."
"In this respect the following demands are particularly important."
"First and foremost, monitoring of the situation in the Black Sea - both now, barely a month after the disaster, and much later on."
"The next demand is to get the European Union's neighbouring countries, at long last, to begin modernising their fleets, especially their tankers."
"The Black Sea is turning blacker and blacker, not from the natural causes to which it owes its name but from the colour of crude oil."
"It could become one huge oil container."
"Pressure must be brought to bear on the EU's neighbouring countries to impose a swift ban on the use of obsolete single hull tankers."
"I therefore ask the House to adopt the motion for a resolution that has been tabled, in which we call on the Council and Commission to step up cooperation with non-EU riparian states."
"A land border can be closed relatively easily, but a sea border cannot."
"As we shall not be building dams, the action proposed is also in our own interests."
"on behalf of the PSE group. - (RO) Mr. President, following the recent violent storms in the Black Sea, four ships sank and seven were damaged, among which there were two oil tankers."
"The accidents happened in the Kerch strait, which connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov and represents the main route for the export of Russian oil to Europe."
"2,000 tons of fuel oil spilled into the sea and the ships that sank were carrying over 7 tons of sulphur."
"The Community Civil Protection Mechanism sent a team of 7 experts to the field to evaluate the effects and identify the necessary actions."
"As rapporteur for the endorsement of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy of the European Parliament regarding the Commission's Communication on the Black Sea Synergy, I asked the Union to become a leader in promoting the principles of the common maritime policy and developing maritime transport routes in this region."
"The legislative package on maritime transport is important for the Black Sea region."
"The Directive regarding port control and Directive 65/2005 on port security will increase the maritime transport safety in the region."
"In 2006, under the Black Sea Memorandum of Understanding, over 4,650 inspections of ships belonging to 83 flags were performed."
"Following the inspections carried out by the authorities of Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, the Russian Federation, Turkey and Ukraine, it was found that 69.39% of the ships had deficiencies, and approximately 6% of them were retained."
"Out of the total retained ships, 8.7% were cargo ships, 2.9% passenger ships, 2.7% ships carrying chemical substance and 0.5% oil tankers."
"These retentions were due to deficiencies in the systems for navigation safety, absence of rescue equipment and flaws of equipment and structures providing ship stability."
"Also, the countries bordering the Black Sea, such as Georgia, are on the black list of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding, and the other 5 countries bordering the Black Sea are on the grey list."
"I think that the Union should do more to increase the maritime transport safety in the region."
"The European Maritime Safety Agency, together with the Secretariat of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding and the Member States, will finance studies and programmes to increase the maritime transport safety."
"As of 2007, the agency will support Member States, by providing assistance, to prepare capabilities for preventing and combating sea pollution with toxic substances."
"Through the TEN-T budget, the Commission has already created projects for the development of maritime routes in the region of the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the seas situated in Western Europe."
"I request that the Commission carry out a similar study for the Black Sea region as well and I also request the use of the CleanSeaNet service, developed by the agency, which allows the detection of oil spill and surveillance in European waters, in the Black Sea region as well."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner."
"First of all I would like to thank Mr Costa, who tabled the motion for a resolution on the issue under debate on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Politically, though, I would like a much quicker reaction than merely emphasising the need for the Council not to delay in adopting a position on the seven legislative proposals in the third maritime safety package."
"In my view, this solves nothing in the ecologically dangerous internal seas, such as the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea, which are surrounded by both EU Member States and the Russian state, as a coastal state."
"In view of the level of oil prices and the profit levels involved, Russia's oil exports by sea will grow very quickly in the future."
"This corresponds to Russia's transport policy: to export oil via its own country's ports, while at the same time keeping the pipelines in the EU oil terminals at Ventspils and Būtingshut."
"Can we expect an increase in demand for these tankers, and will Russia's fleet of tankers receive the necessary investment to avoid further use of single-hull, 40-year-old tankers and vessels designed for river use?"
"I think not."
"The basic motivation for potential oil transport by sea will be wrecks that are as cheap as possible."
"I believe that if stringent maritime safety measures are maintained only in the European Union, this will not save the environment in the seas adjoining it unless it can bring in international standards."
"Thank you."
"(HU) We have seen explosive growth in many areas in recent decades, but nothing compares with the growth that has taken place in global trade and, in connection with this, the transportation of goods."
"Sea transportation has played a prominent role in this explosion, since 90% of the European Union's external trade is in this area."
"Since this is the biggest method of transportation, I feel that people are right to expect that this means of transporting people and goods should also be safe and clean, so that the risk of accidents occurring at sea and pollution caused by ships falls."
"Over the last month three grave disasters have occurred, the total scale of which is the same as the Exxon Valdez pollution of 1989, so this must have a sobering effect."
"Attention must be drawn to the importance of prevention and effective measures."
"The environmental damage caused by accidents like this does not stop at the borders of a country or two, or of a continent, but endangers and will ultimately destroy irrevocably our common values and our common natural treasures."
"There is therefore an urgent need for more effective international coordination than there is now, and to play a serious role in active prevention and in remedial work after accidents."
"It is also necessary to review the international legislation in this area without delay, to fill in the gaps, to prohibit ships designed for river traffic from going to sea, and to enforce effectively the 'polluter pays' principle."
"It is the overriding duty of the European Union to press for measures aimed at safe sea shipping at international level, as has already happened in the European Union."
"Thank you."
"(RO) Mr. President, the incident in November caused ecological damage both to the Black Sea, and to the Sea of Azov, proving that sea waters have no borders and oil spills caused by accidents that happen outside the European space may also affect the coastal ecosystems of the Member States."
"The sunk ships that caused the pollution of the Black Sea were designed for inland water navigation and not for sea navigation, thus causing the spillage of tons of oil into the sea and affecting the natural habitats of the sea."
"Over 15,000 birds and dolphins were covered in fuel oil and several rare species of flora and fauna, from the Black Sea coast and bottom, were destroyed, requiring significant efforts in order to recover the integrity of the Black Sea ecosystem."
"The degradation of aquatic life is full of negative consequences, since it influences the ecological security and the quality of life and health of the population."
"The acute reduction of the Black Sea biodiversity is worrying due to the continuous degradation of the ecosystem, illegal fishing and overexploitation of natural resources, and oil spills contribute to the worsening of the environmental condition in this region, which is deemed the most polluted in the world."
"The European Union Heads of State and Government have undertaken the commitment to stop the reduction of biodiversity by 2010, and these objectives must be achieved in the sea sector as well."
"In the European Union, we have to make sure that maritime transport is carried out under conditions of safety, and sea borders are protected as efficiently as possible from cross-border threats."
"Moreover, the new Green Paper on market-based instruments for environment and related policy purposes aims at a better implementation of the ""polluter pays” principle and I hope it will have a positive influence on the methods to prevent this type of ecological disaster."
"(BG) Mr. Chairman, Colleagues, The Black Sea is not only an external border of the European Union after the accession of Bulgaria and Romania but also a sea of huge economic potential for the development of our Union."
"If we take the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea as a single region, its market has a foreign trade potential worth over 200 million Euro and a population exceeding 350 million."
"Let me briefly recall the debate in September in the wake of the big floods and fires in Europe."
"Then we discussed the need for the establishment of joint forces to help Member States cope with natural disasters like those which struck us this year."
"A similar need could be identified now in the Black Sea region."
"First and foremost, I appeal to the European Commission and, of course, the Member States, especially Bulgaria and Romania, to launch priority study of the need for a regional rescue centre for the Black Sea region to help countries cope with serious situations like the one we witnessed a few months ago."
"Secondly, a thorough analysis should be made of the root causes of these disasters and all other disasters in the Black Sea region so that to learn the lessons and give recommendations for our policy in the region."
"Thirdly, it is time to set up a regional navigation information centre for the Black Sea, which will contribute to the security of transport routes and, generally, navigation in the region."
"The tragedy in the Strait of Kerch is something we have to live and cope with within the shortest possible time limits, especially those of us who border on the Black Sea region."
"But let us use the occasion of this tragedy to seek both reasons and opportunities for cooperation among the Member States, the Commission and the other countries bordering the Black Sea so that to enhance the security of this important European route."
"Thank you."
"(RO) Ladies and Gentlemen, as rapporteur on the Black Sea regional cooperation, I welcome the initiation of this debate, but I also deeply regret the fact that the theme of our discussion is, in reality, a sad acknowledgment of the fact that the Black Sea is still not subject to necessary attention from the European Union and a satisfactory level of implementation of the planned actions."
"Nevertheless, I would like to remind you that, since Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union, the Black Sea has become a partially internal sea and we cannot ignore its strategic importance for the entire world."
"The Black Sea region is of major importance from the point of view of the European Union energy policy and transport policy."
"Therefore, this forces us to develop a global and coherent strategy for the entire region, a strategy that would aim at ensuring security, sustainable development and thorough integration of environmental protection aspects."
"More than that, in order to promote a veritable policy at regional level, joint efforts are required from all countries bordering the sea, which would exceed the national and bilateral framework."
"Thus, I welcome the 2007 launching of the Black Sea Synergy, but I reiterate an essential aspect from my report, namely the need to take concrete and firm steps in order to develop and achieve this cooperation initiative, both within the region and between the region and the European Union."
"The 11 November 2007 black tide tragedy has proved to us that, in this field, we need to combine our efforts."
"The European Union has to play a central role entirely, both through increased involvement in the Black Sea Synergy development and by encouraging its neighbours and partners in this direction."
"This is the only way in which we will be able to respond efficiently to the expectations and calls of our citizens who face the direct consequences of the 11 November disaster today."
"(BG) First and foremost, I would like to express my satisfaction with the fact that the Commission has come up with this opinion."
"This debate comes to show that the Black Sea is now the focal point of European politics and European politicians."
"I commend this approach and believe that it would benefit all citizens of the European Union."
"As mentioned earlier, a lot more should be done to protect the Black Sea region."
"The point is how to prevent disasters like the one which happened in the Strait of Kerch."
"Because disasters can never be fully prevented but their root cause can certainly be minimized."
"There are two ways to ensure better protection of our seas."
"Fist, we have to contunue the promotion of regional cooperation."
"Second, side by side with regional cooperation, better policies are needed in navigation."
"The measures suggested in the third package of the maritime policy are in the right direction and they should be implemented in the best possible manner."
"Their implementation is indispensable for the prevention of events like the one in the Strait of Kerch in the Black Sea region."
"Since the European Parliament and the Commission expressed their support for the package of measures quite some time ago, it is time for the Council to become more active and undertake the necessary steps for the introduction of this package."
"The successful implementation of the measures envisaged in the package, coupled with the enhanced level of regional cooperation, for instance the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the DABLAS initiative for protection of the environment. Could be an important contribution to the security of our seas and, at the same time, could ensure higher competitiveness of our navigation industry."
"I believe that this disaster proves once again the importance of the issue related to our water basisns and the need for appropriate policies to prevent such accidents and to protect the environment."
"Therefore I believe that the time has really come for the third package of measures within the framework of the maritime policy to become a reality and enter into force."
"Thank you."
"(IT) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I should like to explain why we are tabling this motion for a resolution on the shipwrecks in the Kerch Strait in the Black Sea."
"Our solidarity goes to the victims of that disaster!"
"We invite the Council and the Commission carefully to monitor the situation in the Black Sea and to take concrete measures to help to reduce the ecological impact of the disaster."
"Europe does not yet have the panoply of regulations needed to prevent any repetition of very serious accidents along the lines of the Black Sea accident; among other things, those regulations must make states responsible for the safety of the vessels flying their flags and for prosecuting, including through civil proceedings, those responsible for such environmental disasters."
"Although the European Parliament adopted the third maritime safety package at first reading in April 2007, it has not yet been fully approved by and is inexplicably blocked in the Council, despite the commitment that the Portuguese Presidency gave in this respect to the Transport Committee and Parliament."
"The package, consisting of seven reports, is a comprehensive package: it steps up maritime safety standards, safeguards passengers, limits environmental damage in the event of accidents, and sets out obligations and responsibilities on the part of states, carriers and ship-owners."
"Breaking up the debate and giving priority to some aspects and not others is proof that the Council does not want to tackle the issue of safety in a serious way and wants to put a brake on the package as a whole."
"Maritime safety is too important an issue to be the subject of tactics, too serious because of the events that have already taken place: Erika, Prestige, more recently Segesta Jet in the Strait of Messina and Sea Diamond in Santorini!"
"Because of the accidents that have already happened and because increasing maritime traffic in Europe and the world could well increase the risks in future."
"It is for that reason that the European Parliament considers that all seven of the proposals must be taken forward as soon as possible, before there is another environmental disaster with human losses: to harmonise types of classification, to compel states to monitor vessels flying their flags, to ensure that vessels are inspected in ports and to monitor their movements, to decide what action should be taken in the event of accidents and to monitor and manage responsibilities as regards both third parties and passengers."
"We therefore urge the Council not to turn a blind eye to this tragic warning from the Black Sea."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, a few points."
"First of all regarding Russia, a point raised by various Members."
"I would like to begin by saying that the Community civil protection mechanism can be activated only upon a request by an affected country."
"Official letters offering assistance were sent both to Ukraine and the Russian Federation and, while Ukraine answered positively, requesting assistance, Russia declined the offer."
"But on the general issue of maritime safety, my colleague Vice-President Barrot wrote on 10 December to his colleague Mr Levitin, who is the Russian Minister of Transport, to raise these concerns and to stress the importance of strengthened EU-Russia cooperation in the Black Sea as well as the Baltic Sea - in order to improve maritime safety."
"Addressing maritime environment problems at regional level is one of the cornerstones of the European Union's marine strategy and the proposed Marine Strategy Directive, for which a second reading agreement between the Council and Parliament has been reached."
"I think this is a very positive development."
"The Commission has set out its views on a strategy in the region in its communication 'Black Sea synergy - a new regional cooperation initiative'."
"The proposal puts forward an initiative that would focus political attention at the regional level."
"The recent accidents in the Black Sea have notably involved a special category of vessels, the so-called sea/river oil tankers, which can only sail in open seas under certain restrictions."
"More generally the Commission is concerned by the possibility that this category of vessels will trade in other sea areas of the European Union or neighbouring the European Union, and in particular the Baltic Sea."
"Within the EU we have strict rules on maritime safety and the condition of the vessels, but we are also concerned about what happens in international waters both because it could easily affect the European Union and because we are concerned about the global environment."
"That is why these accidents also demonstrate the importance of maintaining pressure on maritime safety issues both at EU and at international level."
"In this respect, as pointed out by Parliament and by Members already, it is important that examination of the seven proposals of the Third Maritime Safety Package is accelerated."
"Finally, on the issue of response, the Commission is also committed to continually strengthening the Community response instruments, such as the civil protection mechanism, to ensure a rapid and effective response should such disasters occur again in the future."
"This also involves cooperation with the EU's neighbours such as the Black Sea countries and of course other third countries."
"I would like to thank Members for the debate and of course I will talk to my colleague about the interesting points you have made."
"I have received one motion for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2)/108(5) of the Rules of Procedure"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007."
"(The sitting was suspended at 19.30 and resumed at 21.00)"
"Membership of committees and delegations: see Minutes"
"Deposit-guarantee schemes (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Christian Ehler, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on deposit-guarantee schemes."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me pleasure to be able to present a report to you today that was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Before the vote in committee, the future of deposit-guarantee schemes was the subject of intense debate, particularly in the light of specific regional problems at the present time and of the recent crisis in the US property market."
"At the end of 2006 the Commission presented a communication reviewing the 1994 Directive on deposit-guarantee schemes."
"Before drafting the communication, the Commission conducted a consultation process."
"On the basis of the empirical findings that emerged, we can conclude that the aims of the directive have essentially been achieved and that there is no need for any legislative intervention at the present time."
"The increasingly cross-border nature of financial market structures in Europe, however, requires us to focus more sharply on the question of cooperation between the diverse deposit-guarantee schemes in Europe."
"In its communication, the Commission identified the areas in which self-regulation measures or different treatment of the legal bases could bring about further improvements in the interests of consumers."
"This approach should, in our view, be pursued further."
"We believe that the dynamic discussion process involving the Commission, the Member States and the EFDI, the European Forum of Deposit Insurers, has a very useful role to play in enabling us to adapt as quickly as possible to changing circumstances."
"The Nordea problem does not warrant calling for an expensive new amendment of the directive at the present moment."
"I am therefore grateful to the Commission for making it crystal-clear that the Nordea problem, which is essentially about the reimbursement of contributions, must be resolved by the Member States."
"Those who operate the deposit-guarantee schemes in the Scandinavian countries and the supervisory authorities there must decide for themselves whether contributions are to be reimbursed or whether deposit guarantees in those countries should be treated like insurance policies and not give rise to refund entitlements."
"That is a fundamental problem, but it is a fundamental problem for the Member States."
"The report can basically be divided into three parts."
"The first part is a discussion of the study undertaken by the Commission and the adoption of a position on its findings, such as the amount of the minimum guarantee."
"The second part addresses the question whether or not the diverse deposit-guarantee schemes in Europe cause unacceptable distortions of competition."
"The third part deals with future crisis and risk management."
"On the first part of my report I intend to be very brief, since it proved largely non-contentious and reflects the findings of the consultation process on deposit-guarantee schemes."
"I believe our statement on the minimum coverage level, which should be adjusted for inflation when the directive is next revised, strikes a balance between the interests of the new Member States and those of the older ones."
"I should like to emphasise that every Member State and every deposit guarantor already has the option of exceeding the European minimum when guaranteeing deposits."
"Another important point that is reflected in the report is the examination of the question whether the diverse deposit-guarantee systems and the various methods used to fund them are distorting competition."
"The Commission has set out its views and presented a study which, if its recommendations were implemented, would result in a harmonisation of funding for individual Member States."
"If Member States with ex post systems were now to be asked to carry out a complete restructuring of their deposit-guarantee schemes at great expense, it would be necessary to analyse whether the diversity of the schemes and the accompanying unacceptable and expensive market distortions are at all justifiable in the internal market."
"This has not yet been analysed, and such an analysis will be an important task for the future."
"The third part of the report examines risk and crisis management."
"The internal market and the increasing degree of cross-border interdependence require us to examine whether cross-border risk and crisis management works smoothly."
"There is an urgent need for in-depth discussions with all stakeholders."
"Long-standing issues such as the problem of free riders and the risk of moral hazard must be addressed in that context."
"I believe that empirical studies analysing crisis and risk management are imperative if we are to work out viable arrangements for burden-sharing in the event of cross-border crises and common methods for early risk detection or develop a system for the introduction of risk-based contributions."
"These studies should then determine the content of subsequent discussions."
"Against this background I also flatly reject the PSE amendment, which postulates existing market distortions although there is currently no evidence of these."
"We believe that the present process is the right approach."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would first like to warmly thank the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Christian Ehler, for supporting the policy set out in our communication."
"I fully endorse your view that legislative proposals are not appropriate at this stage."
"Some issues can be improved through set regulation without major cost impacts and by working together with the European Forum of Deposit Insurers (EFDI)."
"The recent financial turmoil provides evidence that maintaining deposits or confidence is crucial during a financial crisis."
"As to deposit guarantee schemes, two elements seem to be key - an appropriate coverage level and a short payout delay."
"If depositors know that their deposit will be covered and if they feel confident that the insured deposits will be reimbursed rapidly, there is no need for them to join any queue outside a bank."
"The existing directive has proven to be flexible and allows Member States to increase coverage according to their own economic situation."
"Member States may take immediate action if their coverage level proves to be inappropriate."
"The timely payout of insurer deposits can indeed be improved."
"According to the directive, reimbursements should normally not exceed three months, but this reflects the technology available back in 1994."
"This is why we have asked the EFDI to identify obstacles to a rapid payout."
"Depositors must also be made aware of the protection available to them."
"The existing information obligations in the directive are applied differently across Europe."
"Therefore, we have asked the EFDI to identify best practices to improve the dissemination of such information to depositors."
"With regard to cross-border crisis, I share Parliament's view on the need to have clarity about burden-sharing and the interactions between all involved parties before such a crisis occurs."
"The ECOFIN conclusions of 9 October are clear on this point."
"I have noted the suggestion that the EFDI participate in general burden-sharing discussions."
"Let me underline that only very few schemes have powers which go beyond the mere reimbursement of depositors."
"Their funds will also only cover a fraction of the amounts involved in a larger cross-border crisis."
"Therefore, I am unable to support the suggestion to include the EFDI in general burden-sharing discussions."
"The report also stresses the importance of eliminating possible market distortions."
"As requested, we will examine this matter."
"However, currently we do not think that the high cost of fully harmonising the present regulatory framework, estimated at between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 4.5 billion, would be justified."
"Some level-playing-field issues are already being dealt with."
"For instance, we need to facilitate topping up, where a branch should be able to offer a level of protection in a host country that is higher than in its home country."
"However, sometimes, arrangements between schemes in different Member States have not worked in practice, and we support the EFDI's efforts to achieve a voluntary model agreement."
"Some Member States already adjust the contributions through their schemes according to the individual risk of banks."
"We would like to assist interested Member States, as this would contribute towards a level playing field for banks with similar risk profiles."
"In conclusion, Europe needs deposit guarantee schemes that ensure depositor confidence in a financial crisis."
"With the envisaged improvements, I am confident that we will come closer to this objective."
"Madam President, first I would like to thank everyone because this is a very timely issue."
"We all know that ongoing financial turmoil has underlined the importance of cross-border crisis management, and the October ECOFIN decision to have more ex-ante coordination between Member States and, especially, supervisory regimes cannot be more welcome."
"Banks are at the heart of the payment system and deal with the savings of ordinary consumers who are not financial professionals."
"Therefore, the proper functioning of the payment systems and clearing and settlement system is particularly sensitive."
"Many of the banks are functioning cross-border now."
"A scattered national regulatory framework is not adequate."
"Currently, not even the types of account falling under the deficit guarantee scheme's requirements are the same in every Member State."
"We should not let this become a depositors' problem."
"The rapporteur, Mr Ehler, has done good work in the report and showed a lot of willingness to compromise."
"In particular, the report rightly emphasises the importance of eliminating distortions of competition."
"As the Commissioner said, it is very important to guarantee a level playing field."
"However, I regret that the report finally does not address the issue of ex-ante deposit guarantee (DG) schemes."
"While it has been argued by the Member States having ex-post DG systems that this is a problem specific to Scandinavia and Nordic markets, this is not."
"It is actually anti-competitive for the whole single market on a wider scale."
"In fact, most schemes in Europe are ex ante."
"If the rules of refundability and transferability of funds paid into such schemes are not harmonised, this distorts the choice between branch and subsidiary models in the host country, and this leads to distortion of competition."
"So it is very welcome that the Commission is studying this matter, analysing whether there are competition distortions and making possible future recommendations in this area, especially on refundability and transferability of ex ante deposit guarantees already paid in money."
"So I welcome the Commission initiative and Mr Ehler's report but further work needs to be done."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I am grateful to the rapporteur for his text."
"For once, I would echo many of the comments made by Mrs Kauppi."
"We began working on this text back in the spring and I think that those of us who considered it very timely have been proved right by the events of the summer."
"What happened this summer raises questions about deposit-guarantee schemes."
"We simply cannot live with a system where many of the market players operate across a number of countries without deposit-guarantee arrangements that are at least harmonised or based on common principles, in the interests not only of competition by also of public confidence in market mechanisms."
"I was very struck as I travelled around during the summer - and not just in the Scandinavian countries - at how this question of deposit-guarantee systems was raised systematically and was considered crucially important."
"I know, of course, what the Commissioner will say: 'If you were to put together all the European-level guarantee schemes, the total would still be no more than a drop in the ocean by comparison with the sums needed to tackle the crises.'"
"That is a poor argument when we need to reduce our handicap in terms of both competitiveness and confidence in market mechanisms, particularly because it has the effect of distorting business strategies, as companies suddenly find themselves forced to arbitrate, for the wrong reasons, between their various subsidiaries and branches."
"On the basis of all these arguments, I asked my group to support me."
"The group tabled an amendment calling on the Commission to work faster and to recognise what people expect of it: while they may not express their demand loud and specifically, in terms of a priority, they do need reassurance about how Europe's financial markets work and how accurately they respond to events."
"A sound, European-level deposit-guarantee system is bound to make a contribution in this respect."
"Commissioner, I believe it is part of your task to assess the level of confidence or otherwise in the functioning of the financial markets at European level."
"It is hardly enough, I think, to sit back and await fresh research results."
"You need to take action to accelerate the response and enable us to progress on a more harmonised basis, with a better and more transparent understanding of deposit-guarantee schemes and how they operate in the European Union."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, deposit-guarantee schemes have again been in the public spotlight in recent weeks."
"The case of Northern Rock, whose branches were inundated with hundreds of customers rushing to withdraw their savings, and the question of investor compensation in the event of the Bank's collapse are still fresh in our minds."
"This illustrates all too well that the global integration of financial markets poses challenges for Europe too."
"The increase in cross-border consolidation in the banking sector raises questions about supervisory jurisdiction, the appropriate coverage level of deposit-guarantee schemes and cross-border cooperation between these schemes."
"As we know, the European minimum coverage level is set at EUR 20 000, but of course it is actually far higher in many Member States."
"The funding of the guarantee schemes, however, is a matter for the Member States, and the structures of the schemes are quite diverse."
"For this reason the following points need to be clarified, and clarified quickly: the extent to which deposit-guarantee schemes need to be harmonised, their funding and the proactive ex ante use of resources for damage prevention."
"In the case of cross-border institutions, attention focuses in the event of a crisis on the supervisory structure, particularly in the case of group supervision, and on burden-sharing."
"If a subsidiary is operating in a host Member State and belongs to that country's deposit-guarantee scheme but is subject to the supervisory authority of the home Member State by virtue of the principle of group supervision, a gulf is created between the supervision system and the deposit-guarantee scheme, and that is surely unacceptable and contrary to the interests of investors."
"I do, however, support the line taken by the rapporteur."
"Before we resort to legislative measures, the Member States should first eliminate remaining weaknesses in their deposit-guarantee schemes."
"At the same time, the Commission, acting as quickly as possible, should conduct targeted studies of cross-border risk management and a detailed analysis of the ways in which the various schemes are funded."
"On the basis of its findings, serious consideration can be given to legislative measures at a later date if they are shown to be expedient and necessary."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for underlining the need for studies and analyses, but also concluding that, if there are distortions on the market, something has to be done in order to achieve a level playing field."
"I think it is important to conclude this from this debate."
"If there are distortions, we can have different opinions - if they are there."
"But if they are there, something needs to be done."
"We need to do that because I think we all agree that we want more cross-border competition, and we also wish to secure the interests of the consumers."
"It is relevant to discuss the difference between different systems, because if you have in some Member States ex-ante systems and in some Member States different ex-post systems, which in reality assumes that the state might bale out banks which cannot pay their customers, then you have a distortion."
"It is my opinion that, due to the differences in opinion we have, there is a distortion already."
"The distortion is even more serious if it is also based on the assumption that the state should help banks which are not able to pay their customers."
"I think a good achievement with this report by Mr Ehler is that we have achieved that conclusion."
"I think it is important that the Commission respond to that in future actions."
"We might have differences in opinion about how the state of play is today."
"But we do agree on the need for action to be taken if the studies to be done show that there are distortions."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for that and also ask the Commissioner to respond to that with action."
"(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Ehler for his work which comes ten years after the transposition of the 1994 Directive on deposit-guarantee schemes, in a period of financial upheaval when improvements to the European financial services market are under discussion."
"There is currently considerable disparity between the positions adopted by the Member States and there are important issues to resolve."
"Although the majority of the Member States apply the system based on an ex-ante fund, there are still significant disparities in the level of guarantees, the size of funds and their method of financing."
"To give two examples: the sum guaranteed is eight times higher in the most protective state than in the least protective state, and the guarantee fund in one state alone amounts to 40% of the European total."
"This situation creates a distortion of competition."
"The ex-post system threatens national and European financial stability in times of crisis."
"Cross-border banking groups are also experiencing problems."
"The consolidation of funds from different schemes poses practical difficulties."
"A concentration of guarantees in a single system can only be achieved through a proliferation of regulations and agreements between states, something which fragments the system and makes it more vulnerable to an unacceptable accumulation of risk."
"There are substantial questions marks over the aims of the deposit-guarantee scheme: harmonisation of levels of cover, risk-based contributions, utilisation of funds to provide liquidity, burden-sharing, handling of cross-border crises, liquidation of institutions and cooperation between authorities."
"Deposit-guarantee schemes should provide a risk-based safety net capable of protecting depositors, ensuring fair and effective competition, providing stability for the money markets and contributing to an equitable sharing of the burden in crisis situations."
"Therefore, extraction of all the possibilities from the existing framework should not stand in the way of a thorough and ambitious reform once the necessary studies have been carried out."
"(BG) Colleagues, I note the fact that financial crises are not new prehomena; they are indicators of an asymmetry between the financial sector and the real economy."
"The mortgage crisis in the USA has recently made financial experts say that the economies and the financial markets are interrelated and a large-scale discussion is needed to improve risk management."
"The idea in the Ehler draft resolution to assess and improve the precuationary and early warning measures of the European Union with a view to ensuring the stability of the financial martkets, and the issue of guaranteeing deposits as a traditional form of savings in my country Bulgaria is very timely indeed."
"In this context, I wish to emphasize that the responsibility of banks to carefully organize their porfolio and effectively manage the resources of their depositors is of paramount importance."
"Of course, the greater awareness of citizens of the ways to use flexible schemes, the diversification of deposit forms and the mechanisms such as deposit guarantee funds further build confidence and promote financial stability."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I wish to thank Members for their contributions."
"In closing, I would like to make two key points."
"We do not believe that regulatory change is appropriate at the current time."
"The directive has stood the test of time well."
"It is able to adapt to changing circumstances."
"In the longer term it will be crucial from a financial stability perspective for the positive guarantee schemes to contribute to smooth crisis management in an increasingly pan-European banking environment."
"Any further steps towards more harmonised schemes in the European Union now depend therefore on the outcome of the wider work that is currently being conducted in the context of crisis management."
"Concerning the problems raised by both Ms Kauppi and Mr Hökmark, the reimbursement of contributions to a bank that leaves the scheme, for whatever reason, is not covered by the existing directive and is therefore a matter for Member State legislation."
"Harmonisation at European level would require full harmonisation of the funding method."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ehler, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for their very constructive approach."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007."
"Asset management II (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Wolf Klinz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Asset Management ΙΙ."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, since the adoption of the UCITS Directive in 1985, European fund markets have experienced meteoric growth."
"The directive has since been updated twice to take account of new market developments, and further modernisation is right at the top of next year's agenda."
"Not least among the sources of the Commission's present reform project is the first resolution on asset management (Asset Management I) adopted by the European Parliament in April 2006, which set out the main elements of the reform package."
"I am grateful to the Commission for having adopted these recommendations and for its intention to have them implemented in a legislative instrument in the new year."
"The present draft resolution, entitled Asset Management II, is similarly designed to pave the way for future initiatives on the part of the Commission."
"To this end the draft provides for numerous measures which go beyond the content of next year's planned revision package but which we deem necessary if the European funds industry is to become more competitive."
"The following are the main points:"
"Firstly, the Commission should consider an extension of eligible assets to cover property funds and hedge funds."
"Both products help to diversify the risk exposure of portfolios and offer attractive returns on investment."
"Besides scope for adding these products to portfolios, consideration should also be given to a European depository passport, which would give private investors direct access to these products."
"We welcome the establishment by the Commission of an expert group on open real-estate funds (OREFs) and its decision to conduct a study on non-harmonised retail funds."
"Secondly, not only retail investors but also professional providers and institutional investors should be able to benefit fully from a single European market."
"There has never been any scope for these groups, who can effectively do without the traditional consumer protection mechanisms, to operate across borders without very public notification procedures."
"A European private placement regime can remedy that situation."
"It must be designed in such a way that it does not restrict the existing schemes, some of which are very liberal, in individual Member States."
"In order to guarantee this flexibility, Parliament is proposing that the CESR, the Committee of European Securities Regulators, should formulate recommendations for the organisation of such a regime."
"The next step would then involve examining whether that was sufficient or whether there was a need for a universally binding directive."
"Thirdly, the range of investment products for retail investors is constantly increasing, but the available product information does not permit comparison of the relative merits of products."
"This is due in part to the highly fragmented legal framework in Europe."
"If individual investors are to make informed decisions, however, information requirements and disclosure obligations must establish some degree of comparability between competing products."
"The various industries should be able to compete on a level playing field under the same rules."
"For this reason we call on the Commission to review the existing legal frameworks for the various product categories and to present proposals as to how the situation can be improved."
"The aim is not to make products fully comparable."
"Life assurance policies, certificates and funds differ intrinsically in their legal status and structure."
"The aim is rather to establish equivalent information requirements."
"Even maximum transparency, however, will count for nothing if investors do not possess at least a minimum level of knowledge about diverse financial products and the way they work."
"It is therefore the responsibility of the Member States to encourage education initiatives in this domain."
"Fourthly, investors should be able to benefit not only from a wide range of products but also from low costs."
"At the present time, however, the European fund landscape is extremely fragmented, which breeds relative inefficiency and excessive costs, especially by comparison with competitor countries."
"The Commission is planning to create a legal framework next year for fund mergers."
"That is to be welcomed."
"The Commission, however, is disregarding one of the main obstacles to cross-border mergers, namely taxation."
"We therefore call for cross-border mergers to be treated in exactly the same way as national mergers for tax purposes; in other words, they should not create any additional tax liability for investors."
"We are not asking for any measures to be taken on tax rates or the like."
"We are merely asking for cross-border mergers not to be treated differently from domestic mergers."
"Fifthly, Parliament will produce a separate report assessing the potential utility of a European legal framework for hedge funds and private equity."
"The Commission, however, should prepare itself to engage actively in the international discussions on these matters."
"Lastly, I should like to thank my fellow committee members, especially the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups, for their close cooperation."
"I hope that the Commission, as it did the first time, will again embrace our proposals so that we can make the opportunities of the single European market fully available to both investors and the fund industry."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to commend the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Klinz, for taking the initiative to elaborate an own-initiative report, and for the hard work put into that report."
"I would like to take this opportunity also to thank the European Parliament for its valuable contribution to the asset management debate."
"Parliament's previous report on asset management was also an excellent contribution to our work on the UCITS Directive."
"A long process of analysis and consultation has, we believe, succeeded in building a strong consensus on what needs to be done and how."
"We should not overload our agenda, but we are not blind to other issues and problems."
"Today's report testifies to the wide range of other issues confronting the European funds industry."
"We have already started work in many of the areas highlighted in the present report."
"The aim is to build a robust body of evidence on which to base future decisions."
"We are glad to see that a careful impact-assessment-driven process is endorsed by Parliament."
"We strongly believe in that approach in the Commission."
"It would ensure that future initiatives respond to real needs and provide effective solutions."
"We are also applying this approach in our work on private placement."
"By May 2008, we plan to present a Commission communication assessing the need for, and the feasibility of, the European private placement regime."
"The report before us today calls for speedy solutions to facilitate the cross-border passporting of retail non-harmonised funds."
"We are also looking carefully at this important issue, and will report to the Council and Parliament in autumn 2008."
"We hope that this report will bring some empirical basis to this complex discussion."
"Sometimes, listening to this debate, we might have the impression that solutions are identified before a problem has been properly specified."
"We would caution against rushing to further enlarge the EU retail fund framework."
"UCITS 3 already permits a wide range of innovative strategies, including some types of alternative investment."
"We need to be clear about what is currently possible, and on whether risk management controls across the industry are up to scratch, before contemplating further enlargement of the retail fund framework."
"We understand the European funds industry's desire to explore its lead in innovation and financial creativity, but not at the price of investor confidence in the UCITS brand."
"We acknowledge the concerns raised in the report with regard to the divergent regulatory requirements applicable to the distribution of substitute products, and stress that the Commission has an open mind on whether there is a substantive issue that needs to be tackled."
"Responses to the call for evidence launched in October will allow us to assess whether the existing regulatory patchwork results in a real and significant risk of investor detriment."
"In the light of responses and further follow-up work, the Commission will issue a communication in autumn 2008 on the need for EU-level action."
"We welcome the report's acknowledgement of the positive contribution that hedge funds provide to the functioning of markets and corporate efficiency."
"Some recent industry-led initiatives to develop voluntary standards on best practices are a welcome and proportionate response to the demands for greater disclosure."
"We appreciate that Parliament also considers that international responses are needed in these highly globalised businesses."
"In summary, a lot has been achieved in the area of asset management."
"There is a long road ahead."
"New challenges constantly appear in this fast-moving business."
"However, we will do ourselves no favours by rushing into hasty and ill-prepared responses."
"We are glad to see that the Commission has, in Parliament, a valuable partner working towards the same goal, which is an integrated and efficient European fund market delivering for both industry and investors alike."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, in relation to this important own-initiative report on the Commission White Paper on investment funds, our position is that we have decided by general agreement to focus on the non-legislative aspects, given that the legislative proposal for revision of the UCITS III Directive will be tabled in early 2008."
"That said, the issues we have decided to address are vitally important to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities."
"There is a risk that extending the range of eligible assets to include open property funds and alternative funds could mar the excellent worldwide reputation of UCITS products and negatively affect their distribution both within the European Union and to third countries."
"To avoid any detriment to the investment fund industry in Europe, Parliament has asked the Commission to conduct an in-depth study of the possible consequences of including these non-harmonised retail funds among the assets eligible for branding as UCITS."
"Investments in UCITS total thousands of billions of euros and account for around 80% of the investment fund market in Europe."
"The sector is impatiently awaiting revision of the UCITS Directive."
"To prevent any unnecessary and counter-productive delay with that revision, however, Parliament has clearly proposed that no extension of eligible assets should take place until legislative reform of the UCITS Directive is complete."
"On behalf of my group, I have consistently urged that line and I welcome the rapporteur's readiness to compromise."
"The report also calls for the creation of a harmonised framework for private placements within the Union, and I fully support its recommendations on that point."
"The private placement regime needs to be based on an accurate definition of qualified investors, as provided for in the MiFID Directive."
"Properly informed and qualified investors eligible to practise private placement should not, under any circumstances, face a bureaucratic surcharge as a result of rules that are not only unnecessary but actually counterproductive."
"I have to oppose the Socialists' amendment calling for equivalence between Member States' systems of regulation and supervision in the context of applying the private placement regime, which would entail permitting reciprocal access to markets."
"This kind of equivalence across Europe is simply unrealistic."
"I must also highlight one point on which my group and I disagree with the rapporteur."
"It concerns paragraph 19 on the question of so-called 'guarantee funds'."
"The very concept of these funds is controversial and we tried to protest at the mistaken definition of them."
"I hope we shall manage to lose that paragraph."
"I must nonetheless congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work, which enables us to prepare properly for the legislative proposal."
"It means we can now look forward with equanimity to the work that lies ahead next year."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, may I say to Astrid that she should not always assume that Socialist motions will be untenable."
"Let me begin by warmly thanking the rapporteur, Mr Klinz, for his balanced report."
"I must tell the Commissioner that he need not always be so wary of overloading the agenda."
"It is against the backdrop of the US financial and mortgage crisis that we are now dealing with the report on asset management."
"Not even the European Central Bank is able to assess the full extent of the damage this crisis has caused to the European financial system and to European banks."
"And there may - indeed there will - be more to come."
"The global financial market is already so closely intertwined that there was no way of protecting the Union from such speculative escapades, for which all of us must ultimately carry the can."
"Greedy bank executives, focused solely on shareholder value, still enjoy celebrity status, and the US rating agencies continue to do a roaring trade and to lead us up the garden path."
"Knee-jerk legislation, however, is never warranted."
"Nevertheless, there is a lot to be done in this field, and the Commission cannot leave the issue to resolve itself and let the market be."
"One message I wish to highlight from the report is that more information and transparency lead to more consumer protection and greater consumer security."
"That is a very sound starting point."
"Another good thing is that the report refers to hedge funds and private equity, because more and more asset managers are investing in alternative investment products."
"Hedge funds, open real-estate funds and other retail products should therefore be included in the UCITS III Directive - a task that still lies ahead."
"To my mind the very concept of asset management implies steady development, whether through investment certificates, pension funds, life assurance companies, banks or private asset management."
"Since 2003 we have had a directive on insider dealing and market manipulation."
"Its implementation has been totally inadequate."
"The fund industry in particular is always citing costly overregulation and refuses to extend its transparency and liability rules."
"What we need here, Commissioner, is a clearly structured system that provides legal certainty."
"I am pleased that my proposal for an improved corporate governance clause has been accepted but regret the rejection of my motion on EU supervision of financial markets."
"We could and probably must think a bit further in this direction too, Commissioner."
"It is nevertheless gratifying that a cross-party compromise was reached on the issue of guaranteed funds."
"When all is said and done, we should and must make every effort to ensure that speculation by asset managers is restricted and that Parliament, the Commission and the Council do not distinguish themselves by collective inertia."
"Commissioner, that was addressed to you."
"Go to it, and do it well!"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) I would like to point out that this report, though well-balanced and generally acceptable, does not in fact reflect true reality."
"The problem is that most of the financial institutions, as appears to be the case, judging from the data supplied, are not adhering to the rules and regulations we have recommended."
"The main problem appears to be the abuse of the discrepancies occurring in these regulations."
"For this reason we must examine the report in the context of the other reports and documents, like MiFID, with the aim of finding some kind of compatibility."
"Another point that I would that like to highlight is that I support Mrs Lulling's opinion: UCITS is a good name, and we therefore need to be very careful about including new products in the portfolio."
"Why is that?"
"Because we do not know what these products are like."
"I am very sorry, but in this document, as well as in the Commission's proposal, the portfolios and interests of a retail investor and an institutional, professional investor appear to be slightly jumbled."
"Retail investors should have clear definitions and regulations."
"However, when we have both UCITS and alternative investment funds, the reality is that in my country, for example, they are mixed together and presented to the retail investor, who then does not understand what he is investing in."
"That is why we must have clearer definitions and a document that is structured unequivocally."
"I do hope that next year the Commission will produce a document that is structured more clearly."
"We really must protect retail investors."
"Of course, private investors should have more rights, but these should be defined separately."
"We should not advise people to invest in alternative funds that have not even been defined."
"In my country any fund is branded alternative at present."
"Madam President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Klinz, for his own-initiative report and also for taking on board all the proposals and opinions of the other groups."
"Harmonising the environment for asset management and products on the fund market can bring huge benefits to the European economy, as proven also by the 1985 UCITS Directive."
"The UCITS Directive has become a huge brand globally."
"It sells well abroad."
"UCITS represent the basis for a robust fund market in Europe and they make the economy more buoyant through increased stability and the productive reinvestment of savings."
"However, the topic of this report is not the UCITS revision, which is forthcoming and which we welcome."
"The report addresses, instead, non-harmonised retail funds that are outside the scope of UCITS, calling for a number of important measures."
"I would particularly like to welcome the private placement regime, which was also mentioned by the Commissioner."
"Initiative is very instrumental in achieving the European market in non-harmonised funds."
"Second, fee transparency is a long-due and underrated feature for increasing investor information."
"Other measures in the report go in the right direction as well, removing market distortions."
"However - and coming back to UCITS' success - we must not get greedy here or mix things up hastily."
"I am, of course, referring to the debate on extending UCITS' scope to new asset classes such as open-ended real estate funds or funds of hedge funds."
"I do not think the time is right now to discuss these sensitive matters."
"We might end up with a more rigid regime, and we would probably find ourselves in a different financial market environment."
"I also think it is very important to discuss the role of guaranteed funds."
"There is no such thing as a guaranteed fund."
"Our group wanted to have some flexibility."
"We do not think that having a capital adequacy regime for funds solves the problem."
"Guaranteed funds do not exist, and this kind of definition should be removed from the regime."
"That is why we have both put forward a proposal from the PPE-DE Group."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his text."
"The issues it tackles are recurring ones."
"For example, what exactly divides institutional and professional investors from private investors?"
"Some people would have us think there is a sort of 'Great Wall of China' between the two."
"I am unconvinced, and recent events have shown the extent to which financial innovation spreads from one category of investor to another, right down to the individual saver."
"The fiction that we can design legislation entirely around the existence of two types of investor - enlightened, professional investors on the one hand and small savers on the other - is, in my view, a dangerous one."
"We are well aware of the gradual slippage of investment products."
"The notion of two kinds of investor is all very well but we need to recognise very clearly how we apply it."
"The second question I would like to raise - which is also reflected in other texts concerning the financial markets - is about information for investors."
"This is obviously of key importance, yet we are starting from scratch because the complexity of financial innovation is something new that has not yet been properly acknowledged or confronted."
"To leave it at that, however, is not good enough: there is no substitute for responsibility on the part of those engaged in product placement and we need to remember that."
"Thirdly, Commissioner, I have to say that I think you slipped up with regard to the connection between implementation of the MiFID Directive and the UCITS Directive."
"Does it make sense for the MiFID Directive to be implemented in the Member States before we even know how it will relate to the UCITS Directive?"
"I think the current situation would be more balanced had we had proceeded otherwise."
"With regard to taxation, the rapporteur has mentioned the implications for fund mergers."
"I think we also need to bear in mind the implications for product placement, which could be complicated by obstacles of a purely fiscal nature."
"I should also like to say something about the Socialists' amendment because the reality of the market in these products differs between countries that produce them, countries that buy them and countries that both produce and buy them."
"We have introduced the concept of reciprocity, which would apply not only to opening markets and to market access but also to the nature of regulatory provision and supervision."
"I think these elements are essential because the idea of a non-EU country which only produced these products having access to our markets on any sort of terms simply because we had access to its market (which might well be of no interest to European consumers) seems either unrealistic or purely theoretical and I cannot accept it."
"The rapporteur has suggested more than once that reciprocity would be in breach of WTO rules."
"But Commissioner, I ask you: what did we do when we recognised equivalence rules with the United States?"
"That is precisely the approach we are asking you to take here."
"It is also suggested that the concept is unrealistic because we do not have harmonisation inside the European Union."
"If, however, negotiating equivalence with third countries encouraged us to establish a common standard of regulation and supervision inside the Union, would that not constitute substantial progress?"
"(HU) Thank you, Madam President."
"I hope I will be brief."
"As an Easterner, from an area that is poor in capital, I am not enraptured by the fact that everyone is now biting their nails to see what will happen with hedge funds or private equity when the UCITS is extended because this does not affect our own region at all, or at least will not for a good few years."
"Perhaps we will even experience something of this from the human side with property funds."
"But I would perhaps emphasise what I might expect from the audit, as an Easterner."
"One thing is that the banks, which very often operate as distributors within this mechanism and receive very large sums, should nevertheless be examined for some reason, since the sale cost currently accounts for 60% of total costs, and I note that in my region the banks are unbelievably profitable in this way."
"If we achieve something in this, we have taken a step forward."
"The second thing is that the case of the MiFID inducement has also not said very much for transparency of costs since, for example, if a bank has the fund manager and the seller, we do not know what is going on in the in-house deal, and interestingly not even such in-house deals have been able to break down the different sale prices."
"Thirdly, however, some Member States are doing a great deal or implementing provisions that virtually ensure that the custodian, the fund manager and their management keep their feet on the ground."
"In my country, or our countries, there are very many capable young people, and they are able to perform management activities, for example, at a good price and to very high quality, if they can, and I feel that relocation is in everyone's interests with a view to them coming onto the free market."
"Finally, consumer protection."
"I acknowledge that training really is very important, but alongside it we must highlight tax matters."
"It cannot be that if I want to take out UCITS in another country, I will end up in a worse situation than if I did it in my own country."
"Thank you very much."
"Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Klinz for this report."
"The European fund industry has made some big strides in recent years, and the UCITS Directive has been instrumental in this."
"But, while the fund industry has experienced rapid growth, it has much more potential."
"This potential can be unleashed through increased competition and mobility in the industry across the EU."
"I would like to make some observations about the report."
"I can see merit in the recommendation to extend the scope of UCITS to invest in open-ended real estate funds and funds of hedge funds, but this should be dealt with, in my opinion, in a separate directive or legislative instrument."
"I also see merit in proposals to enhance the EU private placement regime and agree that the definition of eligible investors is crucial."
"It is important to note that, while the definitions contained in the MiFID and the Prospectus Directive offer a good starting point, there may be some additional issues which might also need to be addressed."
"With regard to investment policy and risk management, I want to remind the Parliament that, while CESR is conducting a review of how the risk management process requirements of the UCITS Directive are implemented across Member States, it is not CESR's intention to harmonise these requirements."
"Certain key areas where divergent practices exist could be explored with the objective of a more harmonised approach."
"Guaranteed funds should be backed by capital advocacy requirements and this should be addressed by only allowing funds to be called guaranteed if they are backed by an adequate guarantee arrangement."
"I have concerns regarding any call for a depository passport that would result in the depository being established in a different state from that of the UCITS."
"This would create a regulatory gap because a UCITS and its depository would be subject to separate regulatory regimes, and complex legal issues might arise in the event of difficulties within the UCITS."
"I thank my colleague for this report, which is a very useful one, and I hope that the Commissioner will be able to respond to the points I have raised."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, Parliament's report shows that both our institutions' approaches to moving forward in the area of asset management are very much aligned."
"We also need future decisions to be based on a thorough analysis of impacts."
"We both want efficient markets that respond to the needs and expectations of the European fund industry and European investors."
"Important efforts have been made in that direction."
"More important efforts are ahead of us."
"We are committed to delivering, but we should be cautious."
"We need to preserve the reforms and the repute of the UCITS brand."
"We need to take the time to involve and consult with all stakeholders, and we need to avoid unnecessary intervention that risks distorting the market but does not bring about noticeable benefits."
"Only when all those conditions are met can we be confident that our decisions are up to the challenge."
"We look forward to further cooperation between our institutions in this very important area."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007."
"Cooperation between the Fundamental Rights Agency and the Council of Europe (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Adamos Adamou, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision relating to the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and the Council of Europe on cooperation between the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe - C6-0311/2007 -."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank Parliament and, particularly, the rapporteur, Mr Adamou, for the continuous and constructive cooperation as well as the support in reaching this very important cooperation agreement."
"The establishment of the Agency for Fundamental Rights was a big success for the promotion and respect of fundamental rights in the European Union."
"It is also a success in terms of interinstitutional cooperation."
"I have always been committed to ensuring that this important initiative is fully supported by the three institutions."
"Smooth cooperation between the European Union and the Council of Europe is crucial for ensuring the success of the Agency."
"The draft Council decision reflects this objective."
"It represents the genuine will of the two organisations to work together, and I am delighted to see that the negotiations for the agreement have been swift and made in a very constructive way by both parties."
"This important agreement will enable the Agency to work to the best of its capabilities."
"Indeed, in order to be fully operational, a number of measures have already been taken, and some are still in the pipeline."
"This agreement will help foster a comprehensive cooperation framework."
"It will help to provide a structure platform for both bodies, making mutual dialogue and common action both more possible and more efficient."
"It will also help avoid the duplication of work between the two bodies."
"The agreement provides for regular contacts and meetings between officials of the Agency and the Council of Europe, as well as for the regular exchange of information."
"The appointment of an independent person to sit on the management and executive boards of the Agency fosters an exchange of views and cooperation."
"Finally, this agreement reinforces our shared objective to promote and to protect fundamental rights in the European Union."
"rapporteur. - (EL) Madam President, Commissioner, fellow Members, I would like to begin by expressing my satisfaction at the excellent cooperation so far, between the European Union's Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe, especially in achieving an agreement with which both sides are satisfied. I hope their future cooperation will continue smoothly on the same basis."
"Despite the prolonged discussions and consultations with the shadow rapporteurs on the substantial content of the report, we were informed by the Tabling Office that under Rules 83 (7) and 51 (2) of the Rules of Procedure, it was not possible to amend the text of the Agreement and, in respect of the report itself, only procedural amendments would be admissible, a circumstance which led a number of members of the LIBE Committee to give their vote for the report under protest."
"My report therefore simply approves the conclusion of the Agreement between the Council of Europe and the Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"The EU's system of principles for the protection of fundamental rights has been developed mainly through the case law of the European Court of Justice and confirmed by the express recognition contained in the EU treaties."
"However, it is particularly important to ensure that this system of human rights protection is further strengthened whilst safeguarding basic principles such as non-discrimination, non-exclusion, respect for freedom of expression and religion, freedom of conscience, and social and economic rights."
"The European Agency for Fundamental Rights could provide the relevant institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Community and its Member States with these safeguards during the implementation of Community law."
"It is important to recognise that it is the Council of Europe that has developed, through its advanced work in this field, a comprehensive system of norms and legal and judicial instruments for the protection and promotion of human rights and the rule of law and has gathered extensive experience."
"Therefore, the common aim of protection of fundamental rights, shared by the Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe, has to be achieved in a significant and positive manner, avoiding duplication and any risk of fragility in the well-established judicial and non-judicial system put in place by the Council of Europe for the protection of human rights and individual rights."
"We must take care to ensure that there is no challenge to the legal precedent and the substantial content of human rights protection as established by the Council of Europe, an organisation with 47 member states."
"I would also like to emphasise that any dangers of duplication of powers and procedures must be countered to avoid confusion as regards the aims and responsibilities of the two bodies, so that we can achieve harmonious cooperation between them."
"This must be reflected, above all, in the Agency's annual work programme, and in the strengthening of cohesion and complementarity between the two institutions."
"As regards the exchange of information between the Council of Europe and the Agency for Fundamental Rights, it is of the utmost importance, as far as possible, that such exchange should take place under conditions of absolute confidentiality observed on both sides."
"The Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe should agree on more precise rules regarding the implementation of Article 15 of the Agreement, which provides for grants to be received by the Council of Europe from the Agency, with the aim of achieving full transparency and avoiding any insinuation of excessive interdependence between the two institutions."
"It is also essential to implement Article 7 of the Agreement in a way which will allow the two institutions to exchange, by mutual consent, as much information as possible, with due regard to their rules of procedure, as far as this is possible under the confidentiality rules in force."
"This information should not be used by institutions other than those directly involved in the examination of the issues at stake, nor should it be made available to institutions or agencies of third countries, in the absence of guarantees and controls regarding its use."
"As I have said, the cooperation between the Commission and the Council of Europe during the negotiations for the Agreement has proved fruitful, and it is expected that the two institutions will continue in future to work efficiently together, in the same spirit of cooperation, transparency and complementarily."
"However, it is enormously important that the European Parliament should participate in this process, through periodic reports, and that the Council of Europe should be called on to state its opinion on all the surveys and assessments carried out, with a view to complementarity, non-duplication of work, and the transparency of the operations of the two institutions."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President, I am glad to speak today as shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group concerning this report on the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and the Council of Europe on cooperation between the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe."
"We have had long debates and a lot of questions whether there is a need for an Agency; whether the Council of Europe can accept this; whether there will be real, useful cooperation between the two."
"All the time both Parliament and the Commission said clearly: yes, we need the Agency, we see the sense of this institution and we foresee good cooperation between the Council of Europe and the Agency."
"Therefore I welcome the fact that, now this Agreement is here, we can talk about institutionalised cooperation."
"On the other hand, I am sorry that we could not really improve this text by amending certain aspects, because I would have underlined the need to take into account, whenever the Agency is dealing with concrete issues, all the experience, the expertise, gathered by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, with its reporting system in its various committees, for example in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights where there is excellent expertise and experience in dealing with these issues."
"But nevertheless I am glad, because the conclusion of this Agreement is signalling the need for this body, for the Agency, to start its work as soon as possible."
"The Agency was officially inaugurated on 1 March but it still does not have its operating and management structure in place."
"It is imperative to proceed and improve the situation so as to go further."
"I have been following this dossier since the very beginning of my mandate, noting the extreme difficulties of designing its scope, area of competence and decision-making structures to the satisfaction of all actors involved."
"We are all concerned since the Agency will gather and compile data and prepare recommendations to the institutions in the field, a remit that is hard to define in its boundaries, which is horizontal and which cross-cuts all Community policies."
"We can only be satisfied if we create a credible and responsible Agency that is entrusted with enough power and an adequate budget to cope with its task."
"This Agreement can help this."
"We will ensure that any overlap of these tasks and duplication of work is avoided."
"Let us hope that the solemn proclamation of the Charter on Fundamental Rights today will stand as one side and the Agency will stand as the other side of the same coin: a first practical step towards a future Union policy on human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Madam President, what we are discussing today is an atypical procedure, as the European Parliament is pronouncing on the advisability of a cooperation agreement between the European Union and the Council of Europe."
"We have no opportunity to intervene in this agreement: we are simply assessing it and giving our opinion."
"The Council of Europe is the oldest European organisation concerned with human rights and the promotion of democracy."
"No one here needs reminding that cooperation between the Council of Europe and the European Union - and previously the European Communities - has existed since the beginning."
"Accession to membership by a state wishing to join the European Union is conditional upon respect for values that are inscribed in the Statute of the Council of Europe: the rule of law, democracy and, above all, respect for human rights."
"It is thus good that these two institutions, the European Communities - now the European Union - and the Council of Europe, should cooperate, not only by sitting side by side in Strasbourg but by engaging in common fields of action."
"The agreement we are discussing today is neither highly original nor new, just as the Agency for Fundamental Rights is not an entirely new institution."
"As we know, the Agency for Fundamental Rights replaced the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, based in Vienna, and the Centre had a similar cooperation agreement with the Council of Europe."
"That agreement, concluded in 1999, respected both sides and was in force to the present time, i.e. to the moment when the Centre was replaced by the Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"However, since a new EU body is involved, we must examine the new agreement on cooperation with the Council of Europe to ensure that what appear to be two similar institutions do not compete with each other but cooperate."
"I have to say that the agreement was negotiated quickly but well."
"We have no great reservations concerning its content, nor could we have."
"It establishes a framework for cooperation, provides for regular contacts and, most importantly, creates personal links, since it provides for the Council of Europe to call upon an outside person - and a deputy for that person - sitting on the Agency's management and executive boards."
"All of which inclines me to full support for the motion and acceptance of the agreement, which will serve both institutions well."
"(SK) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the opportunity to speak."
"The report deals with possible conflicts of interest between the European Fundamental Rights Agency and the Council of Europe."
"In my view, this issue is secondary."
"The real difficulty arises between the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg."
"Both these Courts have the authority to act in the area of breaches of human rights and there are some rulings where the two bodies contradict each other."
"The majority of these cases relate to Articles 6 and 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and concern proceedings on infringements of competition rules, such as the cases involving National Panasonic, Hoechst AG, Niemetz, etc."
"Finally, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, endorsed by the European Union, are two similar yet distinct documents."
"The European Fundamental Rights Agency's competences focus on monitoring and support."
"The Agreement concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which will clarify individual competences, is therefore to be welcomed."
"The fact that the Council of Europe will have a representative on the Management Board is also to be welcomed."
"As the Agency's competences are limited, I believe that its activities will complement rather than compete with those of the Council of Europe."
"In any case, we will have to continue debating this topic in the light of the changes to the legal status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, in recent months, four decisive steps have been taken by the European Union to promote and protect human rights."
"Firstly, the special Agency for Fundamental Rights has been set up."
"Secondly, a clause on the legally binding force of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and a clause on the accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights of 1950 have been included in the Reform Treaty."
"Thirdly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been solemnly signed in Parliament today; with its formal proclamation, it becomes part of the European acquis."
"A modern code of human rights!"
"Fourthly, the conclusion - which we are discussing today - of the agreement between the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe, signals exactly what the European Union stands for - the promotion of human rights - and shows that this element is fundamental to every modern society, to every modern state."
"We see no subordination, no duplication, no replacement of the role of the Council of Europe, which is secure in its place as an international guardian of human rights."
"On the contrary, a new phase of cooperation, not antagonism, has been initiated."
"I therefore agree with my compatriot, the rapporteur, on everything he has said on this issue, and fully endorse his report, and I congratulate him on this."
"I am an honorary member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which I feel to be an honour; but today I also feel great pride and joy because the two institutions, the European Union and the Council of Europe, are inaugurating their cooperation in this area, and I hope this century will earn its place in world history as the century of human rights."
"(PL) Madam President, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights in Vienna is yet another costly institution that, in addition, arrogates to itself the right to monitor and lecture the Member States on compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and other matters."
"It is hard to resist the impression that European taxpayers' money is being given over to yet another agenda for strengthening the authorities in Brussels and the emerging Eurostate."
"The Council of Europe and the OSCE are existing institutions that deal with the same matters at international, not supranational, level."
"What we are seeing is a duplication of already existing institutions that increases the powers of the European Union and the EU bureaucracy."
"The countries of Europe - including my own country, Poland - are obliged to protect and promote human rights by complying, inter alia, with the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The Agency for Fundamental Rights, however, alongside other agencies that are being set up at an impressive rate, is not only a waste of money but a further dubious, not to say harmful, initiative on the part of Brussels."
"(RO) Ladies and Gentlemen, this plenary session was marked by various European actions in the field of human rights, as well as by the possibility to achieve their assessment for the year 2007."
"At the same time, with the creation of the Agency for Fundamental Rights and the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the decision to conclude a cooperation agreement between the above-mentioned agency and the Council of Europe is part of the European Union's efforts to consolidate its performance and role of human rights promoter, both internally and externally."
"I would like to point out two aspects I believe important in this field."
"First of all, I welcome the intention to achieve a double objective by this agreement, namely, on the one hand, the efficiency and consolidation of the European policy in the field of human rights and coherence and avoidance of duplication, on the other hand."
"This is the only way in which we will be able to continue to promote the respect of the fundamental principles established by the European Convention for Human Rights and supplemented by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, including by consolidating our own mechanisms for this purpose."
"Secondly, I welcome the intention to consolidate cooperation in the specific human rights protection projects launched by the Council of Europe."
"This type of interaction will allow us to further contribute to improving the human rights situation, acting in specific cases, both internally and externally."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that such cooperation should be promoted especially in the European countries bordering the European Union, in order to create a true area of democracy at the external border of the Union."
"As rapporteur on the Black Sea regional cooperation, I ask the European institutions to support the regional cooperation projects."
"I consider the initiative to create a Black Sea Euroregion for promoting democracy at regional level, which was launched by the Council of Europe, a good starting point in this direction and I invite the Commission to manifest its entire support for their success."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007."
"Maintenance obligations (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Genowefa Grabowska, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation on international jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance obligations - C6-0079/2006 -."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the proposed instrument on maintenance obligations seeks to improve the precarious situation of people who depend on maintenance to meet their everyday needs."
"In the European Union, where people are increasingly mobile, maintenance creditors - especially children - should not face obstacles to recover money due to them, particularly when the debtor, such as a parent, leaves or has moved abroad."
"I would like to thank Ms Grabowska, as rapporteur, for the efforts she has made to give a voice to stakeholders such as non-governmental organisations assisting maintenance creditors during the very important public hearing on 11 September."
"We generally welcome Ms Grabowska's report, which supports the proposal in its essential elements."
"I have just a few remarks on some proposed amendments."
"First of all, on the legal basis."
"We are of the opinion that the current instrument relates to family law."
"However, I understand Parliament's concerns, given the existing legal context."
"That is why we have invited the Council, in a communication adopted at the same time as the proposed regulation, to decide - in accordance with Article 67(2) of the Treaty - that the present instrument be adopted according to the codecision procedure."
"That is my opinion, and I will continue to ask Council to act on this invitation."
"Concerning the other amendments on the rules on applicable law."
"Last month, negotiations on a worldwide convention on maintenance obligations were finalised successfully at the Hague Conference on Private International Law."
"Given the satisfactory results of the Convention and the accompanying protocol on applicable law, the Community and its Member States would like to adhere to those international rules."
"Consequently, the rules of the regulation and related amendments proposed should be revised in order to ensure consistency with the international rules."
"The report proposes allowing the courts to apply their own law when cases come before them and when this would accelerate the resolution of the dispute."
"While we recognise the concern to speed up litigation, we believe that the proposed solution does not allow for sufficient legal certainty, and there is the danger that it would not serve the interest of maintenance creditors, who should be protected by application of the same substantive law, regardless of which court is considering the case."
"Finally, Parliament is now voting on its report. An international legal context has become clear."
"I strongly hope this project will be resumed at full speed in 2008."
"I very much trust that the Council will give it the highest priority in the coming months."
"rapporteur. - (PL) Madam President, let me begin by expressing my thanks."
"I want to thank the European Commission very much for its excellent cooperation at working level."
"I also thank the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the shadow rapporteurs, especially the Committee on Legal Affairs and Diana Wallis, who drafted its opinion, for their truly excellent cooperation."
"Mrs Wallis took on the heavy burden of convincing the Commission of the need for amendments to the legal basis."
"I should perhaps start with the legal basis, given that the proposed resolution was referred to us under a procedure that is not acceptable to Parliament."
"We wanted the regulation to be adopted according to the codecision procedure, rather than the consultation procedure."
"I was therefore pleased to hear what the Commissioner told us, and I am aware of the Communication to the Council inviting it to give us that opportunity."
"I would add only one thing to what the Commissioner said."
"I do not question the fact that the maintenance relationship arises out of family law."
"I would argue, however, that, taken as a whole, the maintenance relationship has a mixed character."
"The fact that it originates in family law does not mean that it remains within those bounds."
"It has consequences for the common market and the economic situation of both parties, i.e. that of the maintenance creditor and that of the debtor."
"We are accordingly entitled to extract the maintenance relationship from its origin in family law and associate the execution of maintenance obligations, not with family law, but with areas in which this Parliament holds itself competent, namely the common market, family care and human rights."
"In which case, it seems to me, there should be no difficulty in changing the procedure."
"I therefore consider that this proposal warrants not only Council's attention but acceptance by Council."
"In preparing this regulation we held hearings that were, in truth, one uninterrupted lament."
"Women, mainly, told us of the difficult situation in which they find themselves when they try to enforce maintenance payments for children whose other parent lives in a different country and appears not very interested in raising his child or paying for its upbringing."
"Many different tricks are employed."
"I shall not mention them all but confine myself to one example."
"It is enough to change a single letter of ones surname in order to disappear in Europe almost without trace, and the maintenance obligation vanishes along with the debtor."
"By means of this regulation we seek to ensure that no maintenance debtor in Europe feels safe in thinking that by leaving the country in which a child remains for whom maintenance is not paid, by moving away into the open European Union in which internal borders have been lifted - especially now when the new Member States will be joining the Schengen area in a few days' time - he can take advantage of a situation that works in favour of a person who does not take responsibility for his family."
"Let me mention the two measures in the resolution that seem to me the most important and constitute an innovation."
"A maintenance order issued in the state in which the creditor normally resides will not have to be confirmed in the state in which the maintenance debtor is living."
"The regulation thus proposes abolishment of the 'exequatur' procedure."
"I realise this is something new, but if we want to ensure effective enforcement of maintenance obligations we must take that step."
"If we keep 'exequatur', the whole attempt to achieve effective enforcement falls by the wayside."
"I realise we shall be respecting all the provisions adopted in the framework of the Hague Convention and Conference, but the international system grinds exceedingly slow, and the ratification of agreements in the sphere of private international law can take years."
"The European Union must go forward and ensure that children are provided for when their fathers or mothers forget about them."
"This regulation must therefore be implemented quickly for the good of the children."
"It not only takes care of the children but also protects the creditor."
"Therefore, thanking the Portuguese presidency for the work it put into preparation of the text, I place the matter in the hands of the Slovenian presidency in full confidence that it will see the text through to conclusion and that we shall obtain a good regulation."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very positive statement."
"I should also like to thank Ms Grabowska for her wonderful cooperation on this matter."
"This is one of those proposals that could make Europe a reality for those we serve."
"It could add practical value at difficult times in their lives."
"I do not know how many times, as an elected MEP, I have been contacted by constituents who are having difficulties getting maintenance from somebody in another Member State."
"All too often, I have been unable to give a practical and positive answer."
"With this regulation, I hope that in most circumstances we would be able to do much better."
"The proposal potentially allows the EU to go much further than states can through the Hague Conference process, which has already been mentioned."
"We should indeed be able to go further."
"After all, we have encouraged our citizens to move freely across old national borders within the EU, and should be able to provide an answer, in the form of a good, simple, functioning justice system, when they hit rough times in their marriages or partnerships breaking down."
"Above all, we should be able to offer help to children suffering the financial consequences of marriage breakdown."
"This proposal would give us a simplified one-step process, instead of the current nightmare of applying in one court and then having to go through more or less the same process of enforcement in a foreign court."
"That is too much for people at vulnerable and desperate moments in their lives."
"The Legal Affairs Committee has been happy to endorse most of this proposal, whilst trying to make some technical improvements."
"In this respect I am very grateful to my colleague, Mr Casini."
"However, like the rapporteur, we cannot accept the choice of legal base."
"It should have been codecision, not consultation."
"I believe the Member States have been entirely unreasonable, both in terms of the content of the legislation, and as regards the implications for our citizens."
"I hope they will respond to the Commissioner's appeal."
"Speaking on behalf of my Group, we do not want to see the effectiveness of this one-step system undermined."
"We must, of course, respect the rights of the defence - the judgement debtor - but this should apply to the originating court."
"We should not allow the re-opening of the case in the enforcing court, or we will destroy the very benefits we are seeking to deliver."
"We therefore want to see deletion of Article 33(a), and have grave doubts about amendment 61, which still leaves the door open too wide."
"Finally, I want to make some comments as a UK Member of this Parliament."
"The UK opt-out or failure to opt in to this instrument is bad news for many EU nationals from other Member States now living in the UK, and is also bad news for many Brits whose partners move to another Member State."
"Indeed, there are all sorts of permutations where the opt-out will create chaos and confusion."
"People will be second-class citizens in respect of the justice system available to them."
"However, what I most regret is the failure of the British Government to appreciate the untenable position of British MEPs in these issues."
"Should we actually be working on, speaking on - and, more importantly, voting on -proposals on things that, as they currently stand, will have no application to those who elected us?"
"Others are beginning to question the legitimacy of our position."
"These opt-outs are democratically untenable and destructive to the coherence of the EU civil justice system."
"Pick-and-mix, opt-in and opt-out merely hits those who are vulnerable and in most need of the law's protection."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Grabowska, on her initiative in raising this issue and on the very positive view she has expressed this evening."
"Fellow Members, the round of consultations of the Hague Conference, which began seven years ago, is drawing to a close."
"The question arises: what progress has been made on the issue of mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments in international private law?"
"Where is the declaration that the principle of mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments is the cornerstone of judicial and police cooperation in the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice?"
"The answer is that no great progress has been made in this direction."
"The 2004 Hague Programme has not been promoted to the degree that was needed, despite the efforts and initiatives of the Commissioner responsible, Mr Frattini."
"Unfortunately, the misuse of appeals to national sovereignty by some Member States is a hindrance to the harmonisation of the law, not only on substantive matters, but also on questions of procedure."
"These general observations do not, of course, negate the value and significance of the proposal we are discussing."
"On the contrary, they underline the need to adopt further proposals for Council regulations, covering the whole field of family law: divorce, separation, maintenance and property matters."
"Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 on recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility is in need of radical reform and modernisation."
"This need is indeed being addressed to a large extent with the proposal for the amending regulation, but unfortunately only on the question of maintenance."
"The differences in the substantive law of the Member States, under the vital heading of justice, remain."
"There is still a long way to go."
"Even so, where there is scope for convergence, this harmonisation of the law should be pushed forward."
"The amendments proposed by the European Parliament fill many of the gaps in the proposal and improve its content."
"Above all, they overcome many obstacles which hinder the enforcement of maintenance judgments anywhere in the European Union, and they limit the debtor parent's or spouse's scope for evading justice when he or she has moved from one EU Member State to another."
"Precisely this point is addressed by the amendment which I have tabled to Article 33a, in which I attempt, firstly, not to leave unlimited scope for non-enforcement of an order on grounds of a change of circumstances and, secondly, to allow latitude for dealing with the situation in this way when there are serious, really serious, pertinent circumstances which give the court precisely this right to revise its opinion."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Genowefa Grabowska, most warmly for the work she has put into the regulation before us and her report."
"The splendid result does not surprise me, as Professor Grabowska is one of Poland's leading experts on European law."
"Bearing in mind that the number of divorces and separations in the European Union is rising, the problem of legal impediments to the recognition and enforcement of decisions on maintenance obligations is increasingly important."
"Furthermore, given the degree of integration of the Member States and the still large number of binding legal sources within the European Union, an advanced legal system is essential."
"There is no harmonised system in force in this field at European Union level at the present time."
"I am therefore in favour of the regulation, which contains highly pertinent proposals concerning the problems we are discussing."
"It should be noted that it is the outcome of a long-term programme of work, the Hague Programme for strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union."
"I agree that effective enforcement of maintenance obligations will improve the living conditions and education of many children who are first-line maintenance creditors."
"That is a very important matter for European socialists."
"The proposed regulation not only tackles certain problems of modern society: it can also help improve the operation of the internal market, specifically by removing barriers to the free movement of persons who could suffer as a result of differences in Member States' legislation on the execution of maintenance obligations."
"For the good of all citizens of the European Union, we must strive to achieve rapid and, if possible, cost-free execution of maintenance payments."
"At present, institutions must sometimes resort to drastic measures to enforce the payment of maintenance, while creditors often live in reduced circumstances."
"I also support the idea that court decisions should have the same force as they have in the Member State in which they were issued, without any additional formalities."
"Finally, I would stress the need for greater involvement of the European Parliament in the adoption of decisions on matters of such importance for the future functioning of the European Union and the internal market."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of the report we are examining is to eliminate most of the obstacles to the recovery of maintenance in Europe, making it possible to establish a legal context in keeping with the legitimate expectations of maintenance creditors."
"The most significant starting point is that in the vast majority of cases the maintenance creditor is the weaker party and therefore needs very vigorous protection, and it is evident that the main problem lies in the actual circumstances of maintenance debtors."
"However, it is advisable to do at least what is possible, i.e. to eliminate any unnecessary red tape and to make the applicable law certain, to establish a preference for the law of the place of residence of the creditor and to give immediate effect to the legal decision under which maintenance has to be paid, even in countries other than the country in which the decision has been given."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs, called upon to give an opinion under the enhanced cooperation procedure on jurisdiction, applicable law and enforcement of decisions in matters relating to maintenance obligations, has played an important role in the drafting of the text, achieving a major compromise agreement between the main political groups, for which I should like publicly to thank Mrs Wallis."
"The main aims of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs are to draw up a clear definition of maintenance obligations, extend the scope of application, protect the most vulnerable parties involved and simplify the proposed text."
"It has been necessary to draw up an unambiguous definition of maintenance obligations and to include in the scope of the regulation all orders relating to the payment of lump sums."
"Particular attention has been paid - as I have said - to the most vulnerable parties and, here, the text of the regulation needs to be further simplified."
"In conclusion, as my speaking time has come to a end, I am sure that the PPE-DE Group will give this decision its full support."
"(PL) Mr President, the regrettable increase in marital breakdown, coupled with the growing mobility of people living in the European Union, is inevitably leading to an increase in the number of cross-border conflicts concerning maintenance claims."
"At the present time, in order to enforce a claim against a maintenance debtor living in another Member State it is necessary to apply to the judiciary of the state in which the decision is to be executed."
"Unfortunately, that does not always work, so there is clearly a real need to lay down detailed rules on jurisdiction in regard to maintenance claims."
"The purpose of the draft resolution is to reduce the formal requirements for a court decision to be delivered in any Member State and to ensure its effective execution."
"Upon entry into force, the new regulation will enable an entitled person to obtain a binding enforcement order anywhere in the European Union."
"It will also simplify and unify the enforcement system."
"While welcoming the measures adopted by the Hague Conference, I fully agree with the rapporteur that the regulations applying in this matter in the European Union must be more progressive and more rapidly implemented."
"The increasing mobility of EU citizens is leading to any increase in the number of marriages in which spouses are of different nationalities and live in different states, or live in a Member State of which neither is a national."
"Where an international couple decide to divorce, they may therefore invoke different laws."
"The broad subjective and objective scope of the regulation is justified by the frighteningly low rate of obtention of maintenance payments in certain EU Member States."
"In my own country, Poland, for example, the figure is just 10%."
"The regulation will also enable the mother of an illegitimate child to claim from the child's father payment of the costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth, as well as the costs of her upkeep during childbirth."
"At present such a claim is not recognised in many Member States as a claim for maintenance, which makes it considerably more difficult to pursue."
"Before my country joined the European Union, more than one thousand claims for maintenance from abroad were lodged in the courts every year."
"As a result of the opening of borders, all forecasts predict a drastic rise in the number of such claims, both in Poland and in other countries."
"The opening of borders and labour markets may lead some fathers to run away from their maintenance obligations, and it is mainly the children who will suffer."
"This we cannot accept."
"Member of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be very brief."
"I would like to thank all those who have spoken, the rapporteur and Members who have taken part in this work."
"In forthcoming months, we shall, in my view, have three objectives before us and I hope that the Slovenian Presidency will be able to take them forward successfully."
"First: to convince the Council that if we feel it is useful to amend a legal base under Article 67 of the Treaty, we do so to give a better democratic basis to an initiative which objectively protects vulnerable groups of people, especially children following the breakdown of the family unit."
"The second objective is to ensure that creditors receive the same protection irrespective of the place at which the matter has been brought before the courts: it would be very odd if the so-called lex fori criterion led to a substantial variation in the protection afforded to creditors."
"Another essential objective is therefore to try to harmonise the rules."
"The third objective, where, in my view, work is needed, is that of actual enforcement: in too many cases we affirm the principle of protection of creditors in family matters, but then we do not ensure that it is enforced, or we allow the substance of the case to be reopened when a payment order should be made."
"That does not work in the case of maintenance; were it the case, the measure would be deprived of any meaning."
"We have drawn up fairly innovative proposals: temporarily freezing a proportion of the debtor's bank account if the debtor does not want to pay, or a mandatory periodic payment order against the debtor's assets for the sum that the debtor should pay."
"As you know, there has been dissent and opposition from the majority of the Member States in the Council because that is what really makes a difference for a regulation: either the measure can be genuinely enforced or it is pointless to continue to affirm the importance of protecting children or separated spouses who are maintenance creditors!"
"We shall have to work on these three issues in the coming months and, clearly, in this case, more than in others, the Commission and Parliament are in agreement and we shall have to persuade the Council that this is the right road to take."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) For the moment, there is no single European system to acknowledge and enforce the legal obligation to grant maintenance abroad."
"The Community provisions in this field are insufficient instruments for pursuing debtors who try to avoid their obligations to pay maintenance."
"According to the present regulation, any judgment regarding maintenance given in a Member State must be rapidly and correctly enforced in any other Member State."
"Thus has ensured the simplification of citizens' lives, namely the recovery of child maintenance from the parent or other debtors when such persons reside in a different country to the child, implementation of one of the European fundamental rights, the right to private and family life and child protection, homogenization and simplification of the European legal norms on the entire EU territory and construction of the European space of freedom, security, justice and facilitation of internal market operation."
"I think that the courts notified should check the independent status and competence of legal consultancies and take into consideration the situation of the parties during the proceedings."
"The creditor of the maintenance obligation should benefit from the legal provisions in the country of residence, litigations in this field should be solved less expensively and searching for the most favourable jurisdiction should be avoided."
"Ovine and caprine animals: electronic identification (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 as regards the date of introduction of electronic identification for ovine and caprine animals - C6-0448/2007 -."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as we all know, traceability is a key element of ensuring high standards in animal health and food safety."
"We have had recent experience with certain diseases in the European Union, such as foot-and-mouth disease and bluetongue, which has once again shown the importance of efficient identification systems."
"Individual identification cannot function properly without electronic identification."
"The Commission was requested to confirm or amend, in its report, the date of implementation of electronic identification, not to question the principles of the regulation."
"That is why it is a technical report on the various methods and technology involved."
"The Commission report only focuses on the best way to implement electronic identification."
"However, in order to produce a report, we needed data and input from the Member States, and in particular those Member States already working on the system."
"The studies and trials necessary for the preparation of the report lasted much longer than was originally foreseen, which explains the delay in the report."
"We strongly appreciate and thank Parliament for agreeing to handle this matter as urgent."
"That will prevent a situation of legal uncertainty in January 2008."
"The report concludes that technical conditions for electronic identification of sheep and goats have been fulfilled, but that Member States need a reasonable time frame to prepare the implementation of electronic identification."
"We agree with, and accept, Parliament's position to have a fixed date for introduction of the system."
"On the other hand, we cannot accept the other amendments proposed, which would call into question the very principles of the regulation, since the question now is what the actual date of implementation should be."
"Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the speedy work he has done, and Parliament for agreeing to treat this matter as urgent."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Kyprianou, we have complied with the request to handle this matter swiftly."
"We are dealing here with something urgent, which is precisely why we are still here at this late hour."
"The question is, of course, how this urgent situation arose."
"You have said something about that."
"I had a look through the documentation and came across the very regulation that we want to amend today."
"It dates from 17 December 2003."
"That regulation prescribes that, with effect from 1 January 2008, 'electronic identification according to the guidelines referred to in paragraph 1 [...] shall be obligatory for all animals'."
"There are one or two exemption clauses, which I shall omit, and then it says, 'The Commission shall submit to the Council, by 30 June 2006, a report on the implementation of the electronic identification scheme, accompanied by appropriate proposals, on which the Council shall vote by qualified majority'."
"In short, the matter lies very far back in the past."
"The Commission's report to the Council was evidently never submitted, and there was no comeback from the Council."
"Are you signalling something?"
"If you did submit the report, all the better, but then there was no response from the Member States."
"And then we got into this pickle, realising that the deadline could not be met."
"So far, so bad, but then you proposed that, instead of perhaps setting a new deadline, we should leave it to the comitology procedure to set the date."
"In other words, the setting of the deadline would be your decision."
"We should then have taken all this trouble for nothing, and so the committee decided that the provision on compulsory electronic tagging should enter into force on 31 December 2009 and be applicable from 1 January 2010, two years later than prescribed in the original regulation."
"Be that as it may, the important thing is that we have a date."
"The committee also said that a report should be submitted on this matter too."
"The problem with your proposal, of course, is that you are drawing more and more decision-making into the realm of comitology, just as you did with the old regulation of 17 December 2003, in which the provisions and application arrangements relating to the regime of electronic identification were delegated to the Commission through the comitology procedure."
"At that time there was also to be a report to the Council but no report to Parliament."
"As a result of this practice of subjecting everything to comitology, Parliament is divested of its decision-making rights and its powers of scrutiny, and so we only discover at some later date that obligations have not been honoured."
"If you had not come with these amendments now and requested urgent treatment because you were under pressure to meet the deadline, we should have thought that everything was alright."
"But things were not alright!"
"That must be a warning to us in Parliament not to delegate too much to the Commission but to continue exercising our powers of scrutiny."
"Now there have been a couple of amendments."
"You said you could not accept them."
"The committee stipulated that the rules should be binding."
"That, in fact, is also laid down in the basic regulation, which, as we all know, is not being repealed but only amended."
"Now there are amendments tabled by you, Mr Stevenson, one of them jointly with Mrs McGuinness, which propose that the system be made voluntary."
"Well, if we make it voluntary, we might as well forget the whole thing."
"What would then be left to prescribe?"
"We could resign ourselves to the fact that all cats are grey in the dark."
"I therefore believe that we must stick with compulsory rules and that these compulsory rules must include a date and a report to the European Parliament."
"It will be a lesson to us that this report has made us stumble more or less by chance across this truly unusual way of proceeding on the part of the Commission and the Council."
"I hope, Mr Kyprianou, that I am not being unduly harsh in my criticism, but you can imagine that, as I drafted the report and prepared myself for this evening and consulted the relevant documentation, I had to rub my eyes when I saw all the things that can happen in our European institutions."
"Both Parliament and the Commission - and we as individuals too, as far as I am concerned - surely have an interest in ensuring that this sort of thing does not recur and become a habit."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, let me start by answering a question that was put to me by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf."
"He was asking why my amendments seek to make this system voluntary."
"I can tell Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf very quickly why I seek to make it voluntary."
"Last week in my constituency in Scotland, cast ewes - for the non-agricultural people in the Chamber (there are not many people in the Chamber), they are old female sheep - were selling for GBP 2 a head."
"A year ago they were selling for GBP 60 a head; this year, GBP 2 a head."
"I ask the rapporteur: how is a farmer who is only getting two quid a head for his sheep supposed to fit microchips and buy expensive scanners and readers that can comply with a mandatory electronic ID system?"
"This is the economic problem."
"The original Commission proposal was perfectly correct in seeking stakeholder consultation and in seeking economic-impact cost-benefit analysis."
"I have not seen all the figures."
"I do not know what the intention would be for the sheep farmers in my constituency."
"I have to remind the Members in this House that the UK has the biggest sheep flock in the whole of Europe - by far the biggest."
"The impact of this would be catastrophic with the economic situation the way it is."
"It would actually mean - if this becomes mandatory and we go by the dates set by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in their vote on Monday night, and we set 31 December 2009 as the mandatory introduction - that a whole group of sheep farmers in Britain will close down and go out of business."
"The upland areas and the hills that have been looked after by sheep farmers and grazed by sheep for centuries will go wild and then the public will realise the damage that has been done."
"While we are wreaking this damage in a flock that already has the best traceability in Europe - we have absolute guaranteed traceability in the UK at the present time and the sheep farmers cannot understand why we want to impose a new system of electronic identification when they already have high-quality traceability - we are importing sheep meat into the EU from outside, from countries that do not respect our levels of hygiene and welfare and the rigorous regulations that we apply to our sheep farmers."
"So, let us have a little bit of sensitivity here."
"I hope that when we come to vote on this tomorrow the Members will see the reason why we are asking for a voluntary system and not yet fixing a mandatory date for the introduction of electronic ID."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. -(ES) Mr President, I am one who always listens carefully to Mr Stevenson whenever he speaks, and I have been listening to him for several years now, but this speech surprises me, because it is one which would have been better made in 2003 and not 2007, nearly 2008 in fact."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf put it very well: this is a 2004 regulation, we debated it in Parliament in 2003, and the regulation provides that the date of entry into force for the system of electronic identification for ovine and caprine animals is to be 1 January 2008."
"So, Mr Stevenson - I have no doubt whatever that you have ovine animals in your constituency, as I do myself - the five Member States with the biggest ovine and caprine flocks are, besides your country and mine, France, Italy and Greece."
"Well now, these four Member States have undertaken the task, which seems so abhorrent to you, of convincing their farmers to tag ovine and caprine animals, because we were told that the regulation said that electronic identification was going to be obligatory from 1 January 2008."
"I, as a Member of this Parliament, entirely understand this."
"I also understand that there are Member States - such as yours, which is why I have just been listening to you - which have not fulfilled their duties, and with this in mind, I voluntarily proposed a date - which has moreover been accepted by the Committee on Agriculture - extending that time-limit slightly, but, as you know, whereas they might pay two pounds an animal in your constituency, in mine they only pay one pound."
"At this point in time, with animal disease problems being prevalent in Europe, I think that a system such as this provides a guarantee and a way of enhancing the value of what our farmers are producing."
"It is an identification system which enables us to know the provenance of any animal transiting Community territory and be assured that it is in good health; it is a guarantee for the consumer and that has to be good for the farmer, because he is going to get more for his meat."
"If they are not going to get any more for their meat, that is just where we are now with bluetongue, foot-and-mouth disease and the chikungunya mosquito."
"If that is the case then there is no hope for us."
"So, please, let us just get to work, let us be coherent and read and examine the regulation referred to by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf -which I would repeat is a 2004 regulation - let us read it carefully, let us recognise that there are a few exceptions in it, but it is not a matter of do-as-you-please, because the date cannot be voluntary."
"It cannot be voluntary because we, the Commission and the Council decided that it was obligatory."
"In other words, I cannot turn the clock back to three years ago and tell my farmers that all their efforts up until now are completely pointless because the British forgot to ask their farmers to do the same."
"Do you understand me?"
"I am asking you to read my amendment carefully."
"My group is definitely not about to question the obligatory nature of the system, because that would create unlawful discrimination between Member States and within the European Union itself, although it would not surprise me - and I am not referring to you, Mr Stevenson - that someone who had the gall to reject the Charter of Fundamental Rights in this House today could display equal or greater gall in rejecting the identification of ovine and caprine animals."
"Here we are then: I think we have a regulation, the Commission has made us a reasonable proposal, we have also made a reasonable proposal to the Commission, so let us try to finish this matter this morning without too much damage on either side."
"Mr President, I rise very much to support what Mr Stevenson has just said and also very much to support what the Commission is trying to do."
"I think we do have to realise the scale of sheep farming and the number of animals involved."
"You are talking about 25 million sheep in the UK, 8.5 million in France, 3 million in Ireland and significant numbers in Spain and other countries."
"The system has got to be right."
"If we are going to introduce an electronic system, it has got to be practical and cost-effective, and farmers have got to be able to use it practically."
"As Mr Stevenson has quite rightly said, the sheep is an animal that is not of huge value, so all of this is not going to be done by veterinarians."
"A lot of this is going to have to be carried out by farmers, and when they come to read those tags, it is has got to be practically done up the side of a mountain in wet conditions, and all sorts of things."
"I have seen a lot of these electronic systems work in hotel rooms as you move people through different doorways, and they say there is no collision between the different tags."
"You also want a system where, when a lorry-load of sheep drives into a market, in ideal circumstances, you want to be able to electronically check every sheep that is in that lorry."
"This is the ideal system."
"What I say to you quite clearly is that there is no point in moving forward on electronic tagging until we have got a practical system, cost-effective and ready to use."
"Therefore, I think you are absolutely right to say, 'Come back at the end of 2009 and see where we are'."
"As Mr Stevenson has quite rightly said, let us use this as a voluntary system when Member States are ready, when there is a lot of movement of sheep, and when we have got a system that works."
"Please do not bring it in too quickly, before we are ready."
"Mr President, once again we are here to debate the tagging of sheep."
"All I can say is that it is an awful pity that the Commission did not listen to us way back in the early days when we questioned what they were proposing then and advised them."
"I would say to Ms Miguélez Ramos: yes, we did make these speeches way back at the beginning when there was the discussion on tagging sheep."
"But unfortunately what we said was not listened to, even when we said it would be unworkable."
"So we did warn you and you would not listen."
"The reality is that sheep farmers could never afford the cost of electronic tagging because they are receiving less now for their lambs than they were 20 years ago!"
"You tell me of any other part of any other business of any other industry that is asked to put out tremendous expenditure and receive less for what they are producing than they did 20 years ago."
"I know this is the case from personal experience."
"The present system we have is sufficient."
"So, let us kick this very much into the long grass for the future."
"I can accept coming back and looking at it in 2009."
"Maybe, over that period of time, the electronic tagging technology, which at the moment is far too expensive, may, like many other areas of technology, become more affordable with a combination of lower costs and better returns to the sheep producer."
"Then we could examine this all over again."
"The big challenge to sheep production is to achieve profitability and when that happens we can move forward with confidence."
"I must say it was with great interest that I heard Ms Miguélez Ramos and Mr Stevenson having an exchange of views over sheep because they usually have an exchange of views over fish, which is totally different!"
"It is probably even more argumentative than over sheep as they are doing tonight."
"But for sheep farmers, receiving such small rewards for hard work, as has been outlined by Mr Parish, makes this is a very difficult job."
"There are thousands of sheep on the top of mountains for all of the summertime."
"You try and catch them; you try and tag them; you try and follow them."
"I have to say to the Commissioner: I just wish you would send some of your officials who draw up some of these plans out to these areas and see what the sheep farmers have to put up with, see what they have to go through."
"Then you might understand how we feel and why we put forward these views."
"Yes, let us do it on a voluntary basis."
"Let us do it when we are ready."
"Let us move at a proper pace and let us take it at a speed which we can afford."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will be very brief, as it is late."
"I would like to remind the honourable Members that what we are discussing today is the date of introduction of the system."
"A decision was correctly taken to put the system in place, but the date was left open, or rather a date was fixed which, it was decided, we should subsequently amend or confirm."
"The data from a number of Member States showed two things."
"First of all that implementation was feasible, both technically and economically - as is stated in the report - and also that more time was needed for the Member States to introduce the system, meaning that a more realistic date was needed."
"The truth is that the Commission did propose to have this date set at a later stage."
"I can assure you there was no intention to circumvent Parliament, and that is precisely why we chose this way of proceeding - having this debate, and not inserting an article in the regulation, which would have allowed us to take a decision with the Council alone."
"There was never any intention on the part of the Commission not to include or involve Parliament in these decisions."
"The setting of a date was considered to be a technical question."
"Since the principle had already been adopted, we thought that this technical question could be adopted through comitology and, to repeat what I said earlier, we have no problem in accepting the amendment setting a specific date, which I believe allows Member States enough time - two years - to prepare."
"However, we would be reluctant to agree to voluntary systems, since the regulation concerns traceability, and traceability has to be effective and applied equally in the Member States."
"It is also a specific reflection of the animal health situation in the European Union."
"One can look at the direct cost of the system as it appears, but, if you take the longer-term benefits of the savings generated by the reduction in losses and animal diseases, we believe it will eventually be of benefit from the economic point of view."
"Nevertheless, we are ready to accept the amendment by Parliament, which we believe will also be adopted by the Council next week."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has the floor on a point of order."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question."
"Commissioner Kyprianou, I tabled an amendment providing for certain exceptions, which are not intended to be implemented on a voluntary basis, and indeed the original instrument also allows for a variation, an updating, if it is done in accordance with Article 9(4)."
"In certain circumstances - and these must not include voluntary arrangements, which would render the whole exercise pointless - it would be possible to give some consideration to ways in which the concerns that my fellow Members have expressed here could be met in practice."
"This is only intended as a suggestion and a question to which you might like to give some thought."
"That was not a point of order, but would the Commissioner care to answer the question?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as I said, we have a problem accepting amendments that will affect the main principles and aspects of the regulation."
"We will look at it again but, nevertheless, this is a concern."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 13 December 2007."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - I do not believe that sufficient information has been provided on the efficiency and effectiveness of electronic identification (EID) for sheep and goats."
"Furthermore, I believe that an economic assessment, notably a cost-benefit analysis of the impact on producers, is necessary before fixing a date for the introduction of EID."
"I do not believe there is any justification for setting a date for the introduction of this scheme until the impact of EID, particularly in relation to traceability and disease control, has been assessed."
"In Ireland, the sheep sector is melting down, with many farmers exiting the industry and therefore the imposition of these measures and costs on this sector at this time is unwelcome."
"If there is a legitimate justification for EID in this sector, stock owners would be responsive and would set about introducing it themselves on a voluntary basis."
"If and when this EID scheme is introduced it should take place on a voluntary rather than a compulsory basis."
"Furthermore, should EID be introduced it should only apply to animals born after a certain date and should not apply to existing stock."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at 11.25 p.m.)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 9. a.m.)"
"Mr President, on a point of order, I rise to inquire about the potential use of Rule 147 of our Rules of Procedure, following the disgraceful events of yesterday where some of our colleagues behaved, frankly, like hooligans."
"I would urge the President and the Conference of Presidents to look into this - to take their time and do it properly, but this, surely, is an instance where the imposition of penalties as foreseen under Rule 147 should be, at least, considered."
"We revised this rule last year to distinguish very clearly between protests that are measured, that are visual but do not disrupt the sitting, and those sorts of behaviour which actually disrupt the parliamentary sitting."
"Yesterday, speakers - including our guest, the Prime Minister of Portugal - were shouted down so that they could not be heard."
"That is no way to behave in a pluralist, democratic parliament where we thrive on proper debate, not shouting people down."
"I would urge the President to look into this and, perhaps at the January sitting, announce what penalties he intends to impose: at the very least a reprimand, as foreseen, but perhaps some of the more vigorous penalties that are provided for in our Rules of Procedure."
"Mr Corbett, leaving aside my personal opinions, where I tend to agree with your feelings and opinion, the problem will certainly be referred to the Bureau under the terms of Rule 147 and I am sure the President will follow it up in accordance with the provisions of Rule 147."
"(FR) Mr President, on this matter I totally agree with what Mr Corbett said to us."
"I would just like to add that I was there at the sitting this morning, to hear the apology made by the group chairman, Mr Bonde, for what happened yesterday regarding the ushers."
"What is unacceptable is that a member of Parliament's staff, who was only doing his duty as the President and Presidency required of him, should be attacked using words or phrases that I will not say were too strong, but frankly crap - excuse the term, but I am just using the same language."
"I do not see any official apologies, so we must take the necessary measures to defend Parliament's staff."
"That is why I am here this morning."
"Thank you, Mr Daul."
"I will conclude the requests to speak on this point, which is a procedural matter, by asking Mr Beazley to speak."
"Mr President, I shall be very brief."
"I just wanted to agree wholeheartedly with both Mr Corbett and my group chairman, Mr Daul."
"What happened yesterday was utterly inexcusable."
"However, I would caution, perhaps, that the Conference of Presidents remembers the - perhaps wise - advice of Mr Cohn-Bendit not to give these people the prominence they seek through their quite unacceptable behaviour."
"I was wondering whether, perhaps, the services of Parliament might investigate whether additional facilities for Parliament's crèche might be found, so that those suffering from what apparently is described as 'offensive Faragia' syndrome - the symptoms of which are feeling far out and outrageous; it can, in its extreme form, become contagious - but for those who feel obliged to go to this crèche, and I propose Mr Farage as its custodian, the only known therapy is for them to march up and down with a placard with single words on it and shout at each other at the top of their voice."
"When the fever subsides, they may rest and rejoin the grown-ups."
"So, I wish those who held up those absurd posters yesterday and those who behaved appallingly a merry Christmas; if they have time over the yuletide to reflect on their behaviour, they might even think what they would like to do when they grow up."
"We will also take account of your suggestion, though personally I have some difficulty imagining these fellow Members in a crèche since, in view of the violent tendencies shown by some of them, we could run the risk of a 'Massacre of the Innocents'."
"We will act exactly as laid down in Rule 147 of the Rules of Procedure and will certainly be consistent with it."
"Action taken on Parliament's resolutions: see Minutes"
"Tenth anniversary of the mine ban treaty (Ottawa Convention) (motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes"
"Textiles (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on:"
"the oral question to the Commission on the expiry of the Memorandum of Understanding between the EU and China on imports of certain textile and clothing products, by Pedro Guerreiro, Jacky Hénin, Roberto Musacchio, Marco Rizzo, Ilda Figueiredo and Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group - B6-0388/2007);"
"the oral question to the Commission on textiles by Gianluca Susta, Ignasi Guardans Cambó and Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Robert Sturdy, Tokia Saïfi, Georgios Papastamkos and Vasco Graça Moura, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, Erika Mann, Glyn Ford, Kader Arif and Elisa Ferreira, on behalf of the PSE Group, Cristiana Muscardini and Eugenijus Maldeikis, on behalf of the UEN Group, Caroline Lucas and Alain Lipietz, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group - B6-0383/2007)."
"deputising for the author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am also speaking on behalf of my colleague Gianluca Susta, the first signatory of the question, who is absent today because of important commitments that have arisen in Italy."
"Once again, Parliament wants to tackle the complex situation of the textile industry, asking the Commission for more decisive and appropriate intervention."
"The sector employs millions of workers in Europe, and accounts for significant turnover in many countries, making Europe the second largest exporter in the world and therefore making a very important contribution to European exports."
"In my opinion, it is wrong to consider it a mature sector, because in many cases there is scope for modernisation through technological innovation and research into new materials, and it has strong links with fashion, styling and other specialities in which many European countries have genuine expertise recognised the world over."
"Naturally, this requires substantial support for the sector through industrial policies that put it in the position of being truly capable of facing global competition."
"These are also suggestions made by the High Level Group that was set up, and consequently we are asking the Commission just what follow-up and implementation action it has taken."
"In the immediate future, the urgent problems concern the measures to be taken for the fateful date of 1 January 2008."
"I will mention just three problems: the need for very careful checks: how does the Commission intend to implement the surveillance system to ensure there are effective safeguards; how it will cope with the risk of indirect movements and therefore the problem of twin checking of licences?"
"Basically, for all instruments that look good on paper, the problem is how to put them into practice."
"There is the matter of how to guarantee the authenticity of products and thus the need to keep fighting counterfeiting, piracy and unfair commercial practices, and we hope that the Council - which is not here today - will adopt the 'made in' regulation, which is truly necessary and would be a genuine safeguard measure."
"There is the problem of consumer protection, including from the point of view of health and safety."
"We should apply the same health and safety standards to imported products that we use for the manufacture of products within the European market."
"Finally - and we are directing this to the Commission - there is the problem of willingness to act."
"If at the beginning of 2008 there should again be a boom in imports, if there should be peaks again, as happened in the past, we are asking for a genuine willingness to use new instruments and possibly new measures and safeguard clauses."
"author. - Mr President, Commissioner, two years ago, following the removal of the quotas, the textile sector experienced a veritable big bang."
"To try to cope with the crisis, Commissioner, you were recommending temporary palliative measures with the aim of controlling and restricting imports of some Chinese textiles."
"In a few days time, these safeguards will no longer exist and trade in textiles will be subject to joint European Union/Chinese surveillance, which I hope will be attentive and vigilant."
"Today, our concern is about the way this system of joint surveillance will be set up."
"What guarantees do we have that this twin checking system will be both adequate and effective?"
"The textiles sector is one that has always been globalist, both in terms of production and consumption, but it is one that has paid the price for globalisation."
"However, globalisation can be anticipated and regulated."
"For this to happen there needs to be the political will to set up a competitive framework for our European textile industries."
"We need to work towards fair and reciprocal conditions of market access."
"We need to continue to be fearless in using the instruments at the EU's disposal to defend our trade; being protective is not the same thing as being protectionist."
"We need to prioritise the fight against counterfeiting."
"The Europe of tomorrow will no longer have any industry if we do not stand up for its intellectual copyrights and expertise."
"Having the same rules applied by everyone for everyone is the only way of offering all of the parties concerned a win-win scenario."
"I therefore wish for 2008, Mr Mandelson, that together we can consider the textile sector's bright future in a more peaceful climate."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few weeks after the end of negotiations on the Memorandum of Understanding introducing restrictions on imports of Chinese textiles, it is essential that the European Parliament adopts a strong position on the future of its textiles sector, the structures and organisational methods of which are threatened by its sudden entry into competition with China."
"The joint resolution we are proposing today asks for a clear commitment from the European Commission and the Member States on several points."
"Firstly, for companies and workers in the sector who face major restructuring risks to be fully supported by adequate social measures and by the granting of European funds to support the modernisation of their production facilities."
"Next, we need to commit ourselves to improving the competitiveness of the European textiles sector within the more general framework of a strong and ambitious European industrial policy."
"This objective cannot be achieved until words turn into actions and until we invest heavily in research and development."
"Furthermore, in view of unfair competition from some of our competitors, who base their competitive advantages on social and environmental dumping, or both, Europe needs effective tools to defend itself."
"Greater efficiency will not be achieved by means of hurried reform, which will weaken the EU's means of protection, but by the more transparent and predictable use of existing instruments."
"Finally, Europe needs to use the Euro-Mediterranean partnership as the foundation for an integrated manufacturing area that makes the most of the proximity of the Mediterranean countries to increase competitiveness in the international textiles market."
"The development of the Mediterranean countries with which we want to create a partnership depends on our ability to offer them firm commitments on policies and sectors of common interest."
"author. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a few days away from the fateful deadline of 31 December 2007, when the quotas system for textiles from China will be abolished for good, concerns are growing within European industry."
"China joined the World Trade Organisation some time ago, and has enjoyed many benefits as a result of this, starting with the ban on reintroducing quotas on its textile exports."
"Having accepted these advantages, it should have reciprocated by meeting requirements defined and ratified by the World Trade Organisation."
"It does not seem to us that this has happened, and this is bad for international competition, which is still far from fair, and still far from having the same rules for everyone."
"I am not talking about the comparative social and environmental advantages that unfortunately still remain outside any legal framework in multilateral trade negotiations and that one day, very soon I hope, must be brought into the framework of trade that can truly be described as fair."
"Today, I am talking about the rules that govern the strenuous fight against counterfeits, the safety standards of many products from toys to medicines, and access by our companies to markets like China, which is not the only one where, not just for textiles but also for other sectors, there are still tariff barriers and especially non-tariff barriers that make it very difficult for European industry and small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector to break into the Chinese market."
"In view of situations like this in international trade, we should not be afraid, provided that the legal and economic requirements are met, to use the legitimate instruments available, which have been put in place by multilateral international agreements to protect and safeguard the textile industry, specifically to counterbalance the potential negative effects of the ending of quotas."
"I am talking about the function and effectiveness of the High Level Group for surveillance of the textile market, which will have the task of monitoring the operation of the market in Europe through the import and export licence twin checking system."
"This is one method that should identify indirect trade movements and provide information about flows of imports."
"We need to have the courage and strength to implement the safeguard clause on the basis of the WTO rules and to reintroduce the quotas, at least temporarily, if there is serious damage to our industry from abnormal import levels."
"I am thinking about the constant use of trade protection instruments, such as anti-dumping and anti-subsidy rules and, more generally, about keeping a channel of comparison open between China and the European Union at all times."
"Our textile industry is not afraid of competition, but it must be put in a position to be able to cope with it."
"Consequently, we need to act on two different fronts."
"On the one hand it is important to encourage the modernisation and restructuring process that will make the sector more competitive, with social shock absorbers to cope with a possible backlash, and on the other we need to ensure the sector is fighting on a level playing field, with the same rules for everyone."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is also why we are inviting the Commission and the Council to get the identification of product origins off to a stronger and more incisive start."
"author. - Mr President, I should like to emphasise that the Greens are very aware that the consequences of a totally liberalised textile and apparel market for EU-based producers is still a very pressing issue, particularly for certain production zones within the EU in which the industry is highly concentrated."
"Several hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost since the beginning of 2005, albeit fewer than some of the worst predictions."
"The Greens have from the start flagged our concern about the impact of competition on European producers."
"I think we need to monitor the situation carefully and be ready to apply import restrictions if import surges in the next year overwhelm the capacity of EU-based apparel industries to adapt, as well, of course, as channelling research and development resources to that sector."
"However, we need to be aware that the problem is very much harder for certain poor countries in the South, like Bangladesh and the Philippines, which have been induced by the World Bank and other donors to invest heavily in exporting clothing and apparel products and now find themselves with shrinking export opportunities, a continuous debt burden, no financial means for adjustment of the sector, and misery - especially for millions of women who work for almost nothing in nightshifts in order to undercut the cheapest offer on the market with an even cheaper one."
"It is, in fact, that latter perspective that emphasises that in certain sectors, where too many producers produce too many products, some kind of management tools to control supply are necessary and in the interests of the majority."
"That is why I urge colleagues to support the amendment that the Greens and Socialists have filed together, which reads: 'Calls on the Commission to evaluate the usefulness of supply-side management tools for the clothing sector, in order to level off global competition and prevent a lowest-common-denominator approach to social and environmental standards.'"
"A completely liberalised market in sectors characterised by overproduction capacities brings misery to all but a few."
"In that respect I think we should use the example of the apparel industry to press for new thinking about the way in which policy ought to regulate markets for the benefit of all."
"The reintroduction of some kind of quotas should be considered in this evaluation of supply-side management tools."
"Another option mentioned in the joint resolution which deserves a more comprehensive evaluation is the creation of a Euromed production zone of the clothing and apparel industry."
"Indeed, that option not only points towards the improvement of opportunities for development in the southern Mediterranean rim states, but also gives opportunities to the southern European textile and apparel producers who would profit from shorter transportation times to EU markets."
"It is one of the good examples of how a Euromed economic zone could be sensitively managed without dragging the whole of the Mediterranean region in all-out liberalisation through a free trade agreement."
"From my Group's perspective, we regard this proposal as an option in its own right that should be fostered independently of the contested 2010 Euromed free-trade-agreement project, which, according to the sustainability impact assessments done by DG Trade in the Commission, would involve a significant number of quite negative social and environmental consequences."
"author. - (PT) We are glad to be having this debate to which my parliamentary group has contributed a great deal."
"We hope that the debate will help to protect jobs and the activity of the textile and clothing sector, a strategic sector for the European Union, which has been so little protected and so undervalued."
"As regards the questions to the Commission, we have nothing to add; they have been tabled."
"As regards the joint motion for a resolution, due to be adopted by the European Parliament today, we should like to point out that, although it contains certain points that might in practice protect and promote the textile and clothing sector in the European Union, we have reservations about some other points."
"To give just three examples: the 'Globalisation Adjustment Fund' should not be used as a temporary cushion against the unacceptable social and economic costs of closure and relocation of undertakings, with the consequent destruction of jobs."
"That is, we should intervene on the causes, not the effects."
"The current liberalisation policies need to be reversed and financial means made available that effectively help to protect jobs, to modernise the sector and also to promote the introduction of other industries, including those linked to textiles and clothing, thus making for industrial diversification in regions where that activity is currently concentrated."
"It would not make much sense to urge the European Union to encourage others to review their monetary policies if the EU does not first critically reappraise the strong euro policy and its impact on some EU countries' exports."
"Nor would it make sense to call for trade defence instruments in relation to China, whilst simultaneously supporting the setting up of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area."
"I do not have time in this speech to summarise all our proposals on the European Union's clothing and textile industry."
"They are set out in our motion for a resolution."
"However, we should like to mention some of the amendments tabled to the joint resolution."
"They aim at making up for the lack of any mention of the serious consequences of the liberalisation of the textile and clothing industry at global level, with the closure and relocation of numerous undertakings, in particular to North Africa and Asia, leaving a trail of unemployment and serious socio-economic crises; stressing also that the double-checking 'surveillance system' will serve no purpose unless it prevents any repetition of the situation that occurred in 2005, underscoring the need for new safeguard measures so as to enable employment in, and the business of, the textiles and clothing sector to be safeguarded and promoted in the EU."
"The proposals highlight that some countries have adopted safeguard measures applying until the end of 2008 and it is therefore difficult to understand why the EU has not followed suit."
"The proposals also express disquiet at the Commission's intentions to review trade defence instruments according to the interests of firms which are relocating their production to countries where, because of the low wages and social and environmental standards, production costs are lower."
"They propose that a Community programme should be drawn up for the textiles and clothing sector, and especially for the more disadvantaged regions that depend on it and aid for SMEs."
"They are proposals which maintain that a regulatory framework needs to be laid down to penalise company relocations, making public aid to businesses subject to long-term commitments regarding regional development and employment, including the requirement to pay back aid if such conditions are not met."
"Finally, they are proposals which call for a stronger role for workers' representatives in company boards and in fundamental organisational decision-making."
"They are proposals that we hope will have the support of the European Parliament."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as Members of this House know, back in 2005 the EU and China agreed a memorandum of understanding that included a two-and-a-half-year transition arrangement designed to give some extra breathing space to EU textile producers following the liberalisation of global trade in textiles and clothing."
"The arrangement capped growth each year for 10 particularly sensitive textile and clothing products."
"These caps expire on 31 December 2007, although the memorandum itself remains valid until the end of 2008, and it commits industry and government on both sides to work for a stable transition to free trade in textiles."
"It was always my intention to hold China to that responsibility."
"The Commission negotiated with China a double-checking surveillance system for 2008 that will cover eight textile-product categories with particular sensitivities."
"What this means is that China will issue an export licence for all exports and, in parallel, the EU licensing offices in the Member States will issue an import licence."
"It is a familiar system, and manufacturers, importers and retailers have all welcomed it."
"Its value lies in allowing us to monitor textile import patterns and, because imports have to be licensed before they leave the dock in China, it allows us to see likely developments in advance."
"I am the first to acknowledge the fact that the textile and clothing industry is going through a long period of structural change."
"This started long before the dismantling of quotas."
"Successful European companies are not taking the mass producers head on but are investing in technology and in quality."
"We remain - it is always worth saying it - the second biggest textile exporter in the world."
"We have more fashion and quality brands than the rest of the world put together."
"It is a sign of the European textile producers' confidence and resilience that they have not called for quotas to be further extended."
"They have argued that their competitiveness depends more now on effective action on counterfeiting and market access in China."
"It goes without saying that I intend to throw the entire weight of our trade policy behind these two problems."
"On market access, we will be seeking new access for textile goods in the Doha Round and in all our new FTAs."
"We have also set up a specific working group for textiles as part of the renewed market access strategy."
"Europe is well poised to exploit huge new markets for consumer goods in the emerging economies and we will not simply be sitting back and hoping that these trends go our way."
"Counterfeiting is, if anything, an even greater problem."
"Protecting trademarks and design rights is absolutely central to the textile industry and I raise these issues with the Chinese in every single meeting I have with them."
"We have done some useful collaborative work with the Chinese customs service and trade fair organisers, and the Chinese patent office."
"But, on balance, China remains a huge problem for intellectual property rights holders."
"The counterfeit markets are cleared out one day and the traders creep back in the next."
"As I have said in the past, we have not ruled out the prospect of using the WTO if the situation does not improve."
"Ms Toia mentioned the 'Made in' proposal to assist textiles: I made this proposal, I presented it to the Commission, it was agreed by the Commission but it has not been agreed, I am afraid, by the majority of Member States."
"In view of this, I cannot press the proposal further or do more than I have done."
"Last month, at the EU-China summit in Beijing, I was very careful to pass on some frank messages, and they apply in the textile sector as much as anywhere."
"The EU-China trade relationship has been transformed in the last two decades."
"Both sides have benefited from it immensely but it has become badly imbalanced."
"While China dominates our import markets, our businesses are losing out in China because of counterfeiting and market-access barriers amounting to EUR 55 million a day in lost business opportunities."
"Our spiralling trade deficit reflects both these things."
"This is not because of a lack of competitiveness by European producers."
"We have a surplus in goods trade with the rest of the world and, where we are allowed to compete freely, we are a match for anyone."
"This is not the case in China."
"Instead of a level playing field, it is seriously tilted against us."
"We face trade and investment restrictions, rampant counterfeiting and regulatory barriers in virtually every sector."
"China's WTO obligations six years after it became a member are still too often unmet."
"I see the textiles problems as emblematic of the broader problems we face in China."
"We are China's largest client for clothing and textiles."
"We have respected China's comparative advantage in labour and production costs."
"We are focusing on our own comparative advantages."
"We are moving up the value chain in what we produce."
"We expect the same sort of equal opportunity and fair treatment in China's market that Chinese producers receive in ours."
"At the recent summit, the Premier of China, Wen Jiabao, appeared to hear and understand our strong concern and offered to create a high-level strategic mechanism with the EU to focus on rebalancing our trade deficit with China."
"I welcome this, with one obvious caveat: it is not one more dialogue or one more roadmap we need, it is action - on the ground, in the markets, in the courts, where it matters to European exporters."
"And action not just by the Ministry of Commerce but across the board by the regulating agencies and ministries which restrict market access and law enforcement in all parts of China's economy."
"The openness of Europe's own markets to China will not be politically sustainable if this action does not occur."
"I talk of textiles and clothing products, but also all sectors where Europe has export interests."
"The practical delivery of real change by the new high-level trade deficit mechanism, which I and my trade counterpart are charged with designing and launching, will be the definitive test of China's sincerity."
"I hope their sincerity matches our own in wishing to resolve the issues before us without resorting to avoidable confrontation."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that I find myself almost speechless for once."
"Congratulations!"
"I think it is exactly what this House wanted to hear and I certainly hope he continues with the points that he has raised today in his negotiations with China."
"It is encouraging, and it looks to me as though he has a total and utter grasp of the situation."
"He would not expect me to say that, but I am saying it because I think he has done exactly what is wanted."
"I would just say one thing, or two or three things, very briefly."
"Yesterday, I heard in this House one of the best speeches that I have ever heard any head of state give, and that was by the King of Jordan."
"One of the things that he mentioned was the situation with Euromed, which has a specific relevance to textiles and, of course, is very important for the stability of the whole European/Mediterranean region."
"Perhaps the Commissioner could just add his comments on that, because it is coming up for negotiations."
"I think it is particularly important, particularly as we have Turkey on one side and Morocco on the other; all would be particularly affected by our relationships with China."
"Secondly, as one who does not believe in trade defence instruments and believes more in a free market, but in a free and fair market where competition is equal, I am pleased to hear that he is following those lines."
"Thirdly, what exactly will happen after the Commission's double checking finishes - I believe the Commissioner said at the end of 2008 - bearing in mind the United States has just put in place very strict import conditions?"
"Will this mean more products coming on to the European market than we already have?"
"Finally, Commissioner, may I take this opportunity of wishing yourself, Renate and the rest of your staff a very happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, what will the year 2008 bring to the textile industry in the European Union?"
"Certainly nothing good."
"China has developed into the most aggressive textile power in the world and in 2006 alone, 50 to 60% of high technology in textiles was bought for China in the ring-spinning, weaving and texturing machine sector."
"Capacities are now waiting in the wings."
"European retailers and manufacturers are no longer ordering, but are waiting for better offers from China."
"Further bankruptcies are imminent."
"The European focus on trade will create even bigger problems for us in other sectors, not just in textiles."
"The volume of products we are offered will, of course, increase."
"The variety of textiles, however, will fall."
"If the issue is still to have any meaning, then further restructuring of the industry in the European Union must be flanked and more effectively cushioned in social terms."
"Only a very few niche producers will survive."
"This development also has an extra dimension, however."
"In China, working and pay conditions for textile, garment and leather workers are still abysmal."
"European retailers and investors are in addition beating down prices in China."
"Alongside all the competitive advantages in China, survival is made more difficult because of the strong European support given to the remaining European textile industry."
"A fast buck is always at the expense of the smallest players."
"As a trade unionist, I would expect the sports economy staging the Olympics in China to reveal what it is like for the female workforce there."
"Today 350 to 400 people already die on a daily basis in China's textile factories."
"Up to 100 sustain mutilations to their hands every day."
"Nine out of ten Chinese manufacturers violate international labour standards and even labour standards laid down in Chinese legislation!"
"However, business is going well for us in the retail trade."
"As a trade unionist and as Vice-President of the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers' Federation, I would say to you that it is too late, but not too late for us to take social measures."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I think that the speeches that we are hearing are all along the same lines."
"There have been very few debates recently in which we have heard people from different sides of the House representing different political sensibilities all talking the same language, with exactly the same objective."
"We support free trade, without a doubt, and we support it as a very clear principle."
"It is therefore not about creating barriers: it is about ensuring that the rules of the game are the same for everyone and accepting that the unfair competition by China, through imposing restrictions on access to the market and through extremely serious, permanent and systematic infringements of intellectual and industrial property rights, or the lack of controls on imports, or the question of exchange rate differences, which obviously not only affect textiles but also many other spheres of our commercial relationship, and other measures on the part of China are placing the industry in an extremely serious and very delicate situation."
"The industry is continuing to exist and defend itself in order to survive and is not asking for protection, as Commissioner Mandelson rightly said in his speech, on which I certainly congratulate him."
"It is not asking for barriers, it is asking for the rules of the game to be equal for everyone, and it is asking to be able to play on equal terms."
"In fact the situation is changing entirely from the end of the year, and the Commission cannot just note this, observing it as if it was a meteorological phenomenon It has a large number of weapons and tools at its disposal, such as import controls, with which to ensure that the rules of the game are indeed the same, and it can use the defence mechanisms that it has at its disposal."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner Mandelson, like a British gentleman, wishes to play chess; it is just that his opponent, the Chinese partner, really wants to play another game altogether with totally different rules."
"Obviously we can talk here about monitoring, about controls on imports from China, but let us not forget something known as re-export, which is where China sends certain items to, for example, African countries, and those items then come to us as African products, although really they are products made in Chinese factories located in those countries, or actually manufactured in China."
"I would like to emphasise something about which too little is said here: the matter of artificial lowering of the value of the Chinese currency."
"Obviously this facilitates exports to Europe."
"This is a serious threat."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Commissioner Mandelson most warmly for his clear arguments."
"I had already read about them in detail in the European press."
"Now for my contribution."
"The future of the European textile sector in the light of China's economic rise is at the forefront of this debate."
"Time after time, the Union reveals itself as unable to anticipate China's development adequately."
"The reason for this is the Union's inability to develop an unambiguous trade policy."
"The European Union is divided into a northern and a southern camp, be it on the subject of quotas for textile products or of the reform of trade defence measures."
"It is high time, therefore, that the Member States learned to see beyond their own interests alone."
"An initial step in this regard is the recognition by the northern camp that the protection of its own industry against piracy and illegal State aid is not protectionism, and that an effective set of instruments is required for that protection."
"The southern camp must realise that China's rise has consequences."
"The Union must no longer let itself be caught off guard, as happened in 2005 when the Multifiber Agreement expired."
"Europe's industries must seek niche markets in good time."
"After all, the options for reintroducing quotas are limited until the end of 2008."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the Memorandum of Understanding between the EU and China set to expire imminently, it seems to me that the questions presented clearly express the valid concerns of industry and those in the sector regarding the impact, in the past and present, of the importing - or rather the massive invasion - of Chinese products into the EU Member States."
"On several occasions I have highlighted the fact - and I have not been the only one to do so - that genuine competition and competitiveness for our products in the internal market, more so than in the external market, is assured not only or not so much by a system of quotas, but chiefly by defending the sector from unfair competition."
"Such competition is unfair because it is based on vastly lower cost and production conditions."
"The added value of Chinese production at that cost is disproportionate, because of well-known production factors that are inconsistent with those on our much more civilised continent."
"How can we imagine we can compete with manufacturing where the costs are infinitely lower but where, even in terms of comparative quality, the products are now almost equal to many European products?"
"I believe there is really only one option open to us, the only thing that can re-establish a bit of what I might call fair trade and sustainable competition: a surveillance system over Chinese imports should be based, in my opinion, on checking that manufacturing conditions are not very different from those our industry has to provide."
"We may not be able to demand that labour costs are the same but we can demand that products are definitely made without the use of child labour or in conditions that are shameful or akin to slavery, and that they are made without causing massive damage to the environment, beyond the insufficiently verified environmental safety, consumer safety and certified quality."
"A different policy should also be applied to European industries that relocate outside the EU and engage in unfair competition with respect to industries that continue to manufacture within the EU, perhaps through tax measures that counteract the advantage over companies that do not relocate, to achieve a new balance."
"To conclude, distribution conditions in Europe should also be monitored more closely, in view of what is certainly going on in Italy at least, where what is actually wholesale marketing masquerades as retail distribution."
"(EL) Mr President, we, as the European Union, are being called upon - even now - to redraft our strategy for the important sector of textiles and clothing."
"The outlines of an overall European strategy could be drawn as follows: firstly, ensuring improved access for European products to foreign markets, through the greatest possible worldwide convergence of customs duties at low levels; and eliminating customs barriers."
"Secondly, achieving effective application of the rules of origin to imports."
"Thirdly, giving substantial support, through the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, to small and medium-sized enterprises affected by liberalisation."
"I think it would also be useful to set up a Community programme to support the sector, especially in the less-favoured regions of the Union."
"Fourthly, ensuring that there is an effective way of combating piracy and counterfeiting, given that the textile and clothing sector accounts for more than 50% of the recorded cases."
"Fifthly, maintaining and strengthening the trade defence instruments, which are absolutely essential for combating illicit practices which harm competition."
"Sixthly, guaranteeing that products imported into the European Union are subject to equivalent safety and consumer protection rules."
"As regards China, we express our concern at the application of the double-checking system instead of the extension of quotas to the ten categories of products."
"In any case, we ask of the Commission - we ask of you, Commissioner Mandelson - that the system be applied rigorously and effectively."
"I also remind you of the 'ultimum remedium' of the safeguards which the European Union is entitled to activate."
"To conclude, Mr President, liberalisation of the world trading system does not mean tolerance of unfair competition, illegal trade tactics or, in the end, disruption of the economic and social model."
"(ES) Mr President, allow me to congratulate you, Commissioner, on your firmness and on the agreement reached in October with China regarding the system of double control of textile exports to the European Union."
"In view of the removal of the quota system, which is concluding this year, the agreement will help, or should help, at least, to guarantee that the transition to a free market throughout 2008 is done correctly."
"This is essential for European manufacturing companies, which have already had to deal with huge challenges, as other speakers have said."
"The industry and the authorities will have to work together in order to closely monitor the development of trade patterns with China and prevent a repeat of the situation that occurred in 2005."
"We do, however, regret the fact that the categories covered by the June 2005 agreement only included eight of the 10 products that were subject to limits until 31 December of this year, and on this point I would like you to clarify what the Commission's strategy is going to be for monitoring the two categories of products that have been excluded from the agreed double control system, which are cotton fabrics and table and kitchen linen."
"There is, however, no doubt that in addition to this agreement we will need to continue to act in other areas in order to guarantee that European industry can compete under fair and reciprocal conditions, for example by making progress on the indication of origin marking - although there are the difficulties that you pointed out - or by promoting working, social and environmental conditions in the negotiation of trade agreements."
"All the institutions and businesses must focus on R&D, using the wide range of possibilities offered by the Seventh Framework Programme, and we need to anticipate the changes and, at the same time, take into account the effects of restructuring by adopting the social measures needed to support workers."
"Finally, I would like to welcome the agreement reached on the occasion of the Tenth Europe-China Summit that you mentioned, through which a high-level working group will be created to tackle key issues such as the trade deficit, difficulties accessing the Chinese market and intellectual property rights."
"This is another step in the right direction in terms of improving our relations with China and promoting an advantageous environment for both parties."
"(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is there still a future for the European textile industry?"
"The answer lies to a great extent with the European Commission."
"Last month in Beijing, Commissioner Mandelson denounced the poor safety of Chinese products, the enormous influx of counterfeit goods and the dumping of Chinese export goods."
"Quite rightly, he threatened to lodge a complaint with the WTO."
"Europe's daily imports from China amount to half a billion euro, and eight out of ten of the counterfeit goods intercepted originate from that country."
"As well as from counterfeits, however, the European textile sector is currently suffering from the weakness of the US dollar."
"The weak dollar not only mortgages our exports, but also gives an artificial advantage to countries continuing to use the dollar as a currency."
"Coincidentally, those countries are situated mainly in Asia, and, not so coincidentally, China is holding on to the dollar."
"This is intolerable for the textile sector, which works with large volumes and low profit margins."
"Our industry cannot and must not fall victim to a strong European currency."
"Hence the need to use the euro more and more in our trade relations."
"After all, that was, I thought, one of the reasons for the introduction of our single currency five years ago."
"(PT) The consequence of globalisation within the European area is that productive undertakings are the losers and undertakings exporting technology are the winners."
"That is all very clearly reflected in internal cohesion."
"In the case of the textile industry, the fact that the sector is mainly made up of small and medium-sized enterprises is a disadvantage on the market that represents 6% of total world trade and an estimated turnover of EUR 566 billion."
"In addition, many producer regions are suffering the consequences of economic restructuring, so that it is difficult to achieve sustainability in the sector."
"European production is forced to compete with that of countries that artificially devalue their currency, do not respect environmental protection rules or bear the costs of environmental protection, that frequently infringe intellectual property rights or, even more seriously, on the social and employment front, apart from having much lower wage costs, do not apply such stringent worker protection measures as Europe does."
"It is therefore all the more pressing to make sure that WTO rules are respected and that the Commission is able to monitor imports, not allowing a veil to be artificially drawn over the excesses noted in practice with China as regards textile imports, as has happened in the past."
"The Commission must adopt all the measures needed to safeguard the interests of the European Union, including if necessary the imposition of quotas on China, possibly up to the end of 2008, within the WTO legal framework and must also insist upon total respect for the rules of fair play."
"European producers lack incentives for research and development and for improving the skills of the labour force, they do not have appropriate access to external markets or an effective means of preventing counterfeiting."
"Intellectual property is basic to the added value of the sector and must be defended at all costs in order to encourage production with a high added value."
"Finally, Mr President, Commissioner, consumer safety must not be forgotten."
"It falls to the Commission to prevent any product that might be harmful to our families from coming into the homes of Europe's citizens."
"(EL) Mr President, in Europe, and particularly in Greece, the textile sector consists mainly of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Many of these enterprises are developing in the region."
"We, as the European Union, have a duty to ensure the viability of the sector within our borders, and to guarantee protection for our businesses against unfair competition and illegal trade."
"The European textile sector must become more competitive at international level."
"We need to support measures for the modernisation of our enterprises, innovation, research and development."
"Of course we must take serious account of the fact that on 1 January 2008 the transition period for quotas on imports of textile products from China ends."
"In the wider context, however, and for the sake of European consumers, we shall also have to ensure the enforcement of binding rules on 'made in...' labelling for textile products, and effective application of the surveillance system for imports from third countries."
"(FR) Mr President, when I spoke in this chamber on this same subject in July 2005, I said that the lessons we would learn from the textiles crisis would eventually help us to maintain and develop other sectors of the European economy."
"I think we have made some progress, but not very much."
"Here we are, still demanding more research and development and asking the Commission to make sure that intellectual copyrights are respected."
"These are decisive factors but they are not enough."
"It makes me think that, instead of being a factor of the growth of trade and economic development, the WTO and its rules act as a brake."
"Trade is obviously a source of growth, but in order to be so, it needs to work in both directions."
"The textiles issue in fact throws up two fundamental problems: the absence of an EU industrial policy and the question of the European interest."
"As regards the European interest, I welcome with some satisfaction the Commission communication entitled 'The European Interest: Succeeding in the age of globalisation', published in early October, which says that we need: 'to have ground rules which do not impinge on our capacity to protect our interests and to safeguard our high product standards relating to health, safety, the environment and consumer protection'."
"We will not tolerate third countries that want to operate in the European Union bending the rules applied to the internal market."
"Commissioner, let us start by applying these principles to the textile industry."
"(NL) Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner for his clear intervention."
"I should like to address two remarks to him, however."
"The textile industry is not only important to southern Europe, as Belgium, too, for example, still has a very flourishing textile industry, which provides 25 000 jobs."
"Commissioner, the disappearance of quotas for the 10 finished products on 1 January threatens to have serious repercussions again not only for the sectors concerned, but also for upstream businesses."
"Taking the example of the jeans sector, if this is swamped with Chinese products, whether or not at dumping prices, the producers of the denim material and of the thread are also directly affected."
"Thus, of course, the ramifications are much broader than they seem at first glance."
"My second remark, Commissioner, is that the 'monitoring system' currently only monitors the volume of the imported goods."
"It would be much more efficient if monitoring were also carried out on the basis of prices - and this a priori, or at the time licences are issued."
"Only in this way is a genuinely proactive, preventive approach possible."
"Commissioner Mandelson, we should also like you to tell us when the Commission is planning to take action, as this is rather confusing and vague."
"In other words, how big do imports from China have to grow and how much do the prices of these imports have to decrease before you actually start to take action?"
"It strikes us as no more than logical that we obtain some clarity on this, too, in advance."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I find myself in broad agreement with most of the sentiments that have been expressed during this debate."
"However, I would at the outset reject Mr Belder's view that we do not have a common trade policy in the EU, and that the Member States are so divided that we cannot pursue a policy on, for example, textiles."
"Our experience in textiles demonstrates only too clearly that we do, in fact, have a common trade policy, through which we have been able to bring together Member States with different emphases and different orientations, to weld together their views and to produce a common trade policy in textiles that has been consistently pursued."
"There may be differences on the use of trade defence instruments, but through the review and anticipated reform I want to build fresh consensus and solidarity amongst Member States on the use of those trade defence instruments, and notably on their greater use by SMEs, for which I want to bring forward proposals."
"Some specific points have been made, for example about the double-checking surveillance which will be in operation in 2008."
"The Commission will monitor textile imports from China in as close to real time as possible."
"This includes double-checking surveillance and any other monitoring means at the Commission's disposal, such as the TAXUD surveillance, which provides trade data on the basis of actual trade."
"In the face of a sudden surge of Chinese textiles, the Commission stands ready to use all the instruments at its disposal, should the situation so require."
"However, I would stress that the 2005 deal was a once-and-for-all deal, and the Commission does not intend to make proposals for the extension of the levels agreed."
"As such, it is not opposed to more trade, and an increase could be expected."
"Should the upsurge, however, take such dimensions that action is justified, this will be based on existing requirements and criteria."
"We do rely on the co-responsibility of China for this smooth transition."
"China is well aware that it is not in its interests to repeat what happened in 2005."
"We also rely on the economic operators' self-interest to avoid a recurrence of 2005."
"Textiles are now moving into the same category as any other product, so the usual instruments - including trade defence instruments - apply, with the usual standards."
"The issue of EU assistance for the textiles industry has been raised."
"Let me make two last points on this."
"At the EU level, the Commission has committed over EUR 70 million, for research and development under the sixth framework programme, to textile and clothing projects, while two innovation project proposals have acquired funding within the Europe Innova framework."
"As far as the Globalisation Fund is concerned, it is as open to the textile sector as to other sectors."
"There have, so far, been eight formal applications for a contribution from the European Globalisation Fund, of which four concern textiles."
"None of these textile cases have yet been approved by the budgetary authority."
"They are all still being assessed by the Commission services."
"Lastly, I turn to the issue of the Euro-Mediterranean, raised by Mr Sturdy."
"The Commission has set up a formal Euro-Mediterranean dialogue on the future of the textile and clothing industry, in order to define common strategies towards achieving better competitiveness of the industry in the Euro-Mediterranean zone."
"The objective of the dialogue is to bring Euro-Mediterranean countries and candidate countries together, in order to find common solutions for improving their competitiveness."
"I look forward to receiving proposals emerging from that dialogue."
"I have received six motions for a resolution submitted in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"Economic and trade relations with Korea (debate)"
"The next item is the report by David Martin, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the trade and economic relations with Korea."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, this report had to be put together rather quickly, because we anticipated - we even hoped - that the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and Korea might be concluded by the end of this year."
"That is clearly not going to be the case but, nevertheless, we are pleased that Parliament is able to report today and we hope, through our report today, that we will be able to influence the Commission's position."
"To get to where we are today, some of my colleagues had to work extremely hard, and I would like to thank Christopher Ford from the Trade Committee and Emmanuelle Le Texier from the PSE Group, who worked above and beyond the normal call of duty to get this report prepared in time."
"I would also like to thank Commissioner Mandelson and his services for the good cooperation I have had from the Commission in producing this report, and also the Korean Ambassador, whose assistance enabled me to get an insight into the Korean position on these negotiations."
"Historically, free trade agreements between the European Union and Asian countries have been trade-light, despite their name."
"I think this could be the exception to the rule."
"Korea has shown a willingness and an ability to negotiate a far-reaching and comprehensive bilateral trade agreement."
"Korea is a significant player in the region in Asia."
"It is now a wealthy country, the 11th largest economy in the world."
"Its per capita income is comparable to Spain."
"It is an economy that is growing quickly, and trade between our two regions - between Korea and the European Union - reached EUR 60 billion last year."
"So it is a deal worth doing, and, if we can get it right, I think it is a win-win situation."
"The Korean manufacturing industry, for example, can win through access to European services, enabling Korean manufacturing to expand and to compete more favourably."
"We can win, through access to the Korean market for some of our key goods and services."
"The timetable, as I mentioned, was originally set for conclusion by the end of this year."
"It now realistically looks like May next year will be the earliest negotiations can be concluded, but I am encouraged that, after five rounds of negotiations, talks seem to be getting down to the nitty gritty and seem to be getting serious."
"There are clearly still significant gaps between the European Union position on issues like country-of-origin labelling, technical standards for the automobile industry and on tariff concessions for goods. But the key point is that negotiations are now being conducted at a serious and detailed level."
"My main concerns come in the field of, firstly, social and environmental standards."
"Even with this delay, the Korean agreement looks like being the first of the new generation of FTAs that we agree."
"As such, it can be a template for further FTAs, and I would like to see our ambitions in relation to environmental and social standards raised."
"I would like to ensure that there is a dispute settlement mechanism in the Agreement."
"I do not believe that we should settle for anything less than the United States have settled for, and they have got a dispute settlement mechanism in their report."
"I believe issues like ratification of key ILO conventions and the post-2012 application of any new climate change agreement cannot be left to mere gentlemen's agreements or simply encouraging people to do things."
"We have to actually have some mechanism for settling disputes."
"I hope the Commission will look at this again."
"I also want to argue that the Kaesong Industrial Complex should be looked at sympathetically in relation to such an agreement."
"I accept the Commission's approach that, firstly, we have to get the Free Trade Agreement; but if we can get the FTA, before signature we should look at how we can assist South Korea in terms of encouraging North Korea to come into the real world."
"The Kaesong Industrial Complex, based in North Korea but run by South Korean companies, is a way of engaging North Korea with the rest of the world, and it is a process that we should be encouraging."
"I believe that, through our trade agreement, we can do much to assist South Korea in this process."
"It is not just a matter of interest for South Korea but it is a matter of interest for the world."
"It makes the world a safer place if North and South Korea can cooperate."
"I believe this is an important free trade agreement."
"I believe it is one that both the EU and Korea can win if we get the right deal."
"I support the Commission's view that we should not rush to a settlement, and that a good settlement is better late than a bad settlement that we get early."
"I hope, when Korea changes president at the beginning of next year, that the new president will instruct his administration to work tirelessly to reach this agreement before the summer."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I welcome the excellent and speedy work done by the rapporteur, Mr Martin, and his colleagues and staff."
"Together they have produced a comprehensive and balanced report, which I commend."
"Parliament's endorsement of this motion for a resolution will send a clear signal of support for the Commission's policy of seeking an ambitious and comprehensive free trade agreement (FTA) with South Korea, as part of the strategy laid out in the Global Europe Communication of October 2006."
"The choice of South Korea as partner for this generation of free trade agreements reflects the important economic and political potential of the country, but it is also an acknowledgement of the reality that important barriers exist and persist to stronger economic and trade ties between us."
"The motion is timely: free trade negotiations with South Korea were launched in May 2007, and have progressed rapidly so far."
"We are ready to work for an early conclusion so long as the substance and quality of the outcome are right."
"That is our bottom line and it will remain so."
"Our FTA with South Korea should be fully WTO-compatible."
"That goes without saying."
"We seek far-reaching liberalisation in trade in goods and services, as well as in investment."
"We are paying special attention to non-tariff barriers and to rules and regulations in key areas, such as intellectual property rights, competition and government procurement."
"I fully agree with the importance the report attaches to non-tariff barriers and to effective dispute settlement machinery in this and other aspects of the prospective agreement."
"Studies have suggested that, in some sectors in Korea, non-tariff barriers are now more important than the tariffs themselves."
"Substantial improvements on these behind-the-border barriers to trade, creating real market access for EU exports to South Korea, will be absolutely key to conclusion of the FTA."
"On a few of the specific concerns that have been raised, the question of Kaesong raises complex technical and political questions."
"We welcome the amendments proposed in this regard, because they highlight the complexity of the question, which will require careful consideration."
"The recognition and promotion of the social and environmental aspects of trade - sustainable development - will be an integral part of the free trade agreement with South Korea."
"I agree that effective enforcement of standards is key to securing an ambitious and effective result on sustainable development in this agreement."
"However, a cooperative tone can achieve much more in this area than the appearance of coercion."
"We expect to cover a greater number of multilateral environmental agreements, and to include issues such as decent work and a stronger commitment to ILO core conventions, and expect to go beyond other recent agreements, such as those covered by the Korea-US FTA."
"We will also aim to involve the social partners and civil society in this cooperation."
"The sustainability impact assessment has been launched."
"The main findings of draft reports in the different phases will be discussed with civil society."
"We have set up the SIA to ensure that there will be continuous and rapid feedback into the negotiation process."
"This builds on the initial contacts we had with civil society at the start of the negotiations."
"We have also worked closely with Parliament."
"The cooperation with the rapporteur and the Committee on International Trade has been excellent."
"I myself, as well as the Director-General, have regularly updated that Committee."
"As far as the ratification procedure is concerned, this will depend on the content of the agreement itself, but the Commission is in favour of involving Parliament as much as is possible under the Treaty."
"Finally, a possible future FTA covering the bilateral trade relations with South Korea will be part of an overall and coherent framework of EU relations with South Korea."
"The existing bilateral framework agreement will continue to govern bilateral cooperation and political dialogue."
"To conclude, the goal of this FTA is to complement an ambitious Doha outcome by going deeper and further bilaterally with South Korea."
"Past experience shows that such agreements can road test liberalisation solutions and become stepping-stones for the future evolution of the WTO."
"An ambitious and comprehensive FTA with South Korea is not just commercially significant, but will also mean an important upgrading of the bilateral EU-Korea relationship."
"It is also a recognition of the engagement of the EU on the Korean Peninsula and in the region."
"In a wider sense, it is part of our broader commitment to ensuring that EU trade policy in Asia is keeping up with the dramatic development of that region, and securing the benefits in terms of jobs, growth and growing trade for both sides."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (DE) Mr President, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy thanks the rapporteur for adopting our proposals."
"We think an agreement is reasonable, but would nevertheless point out that there have been considerable sectoral problems with Korea in the past."
"I am thinking here of the discussion on dumping prices in the shipbuilding industry in recent years, for instance, where we also had lawsuits."
"We wish to ascertain whether these sectoral problems are being resolved in order to ensure that both sides really are opening up and Korea is not the unilateral beneficiary, and that - even when we think of our pharmaceutical industry, the car industry, of the many industrial sectors - reciprocity is guaranteed."
"One particular subject was Kaesong."
"The Commissioner has just addressed the issue of how to involve these North Korean special zones."
"According to what I am hearing, eight other special zones are planned."
"In the opinion of the Committee on Industry, international standards must apply here."
"We cannot undermine our own free trade agreements in this way."
"We therefore ask that this aspect in particular be thoroughly checked."
"Otherwise, many thanks - to the Commission, too - for these negotiations!"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, let me first congratulate my colleague, the rapporteur Mr Martin, for a high-quality and comprehensive report."
"Our negotiators should take note of it."
"We should also learn from the recently completed USA-Korea FTA, which shows that speed of conclusion is important, but should not be the top priority."
"The main goal should clearly be to accomplish high quality and an even playing field in flows of trade."
"Today, those flows are still seriously impeded by non-trade barriers."
"Korea does not apply international norms or labelling requirements regarding automotive products or other important products such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and electronics."
"There is also a need for clarification in the area of intellectual property rights and counterfeiting."
"These issues need to be resolved before we sign this FTA, in order to ensure free and fair trade."
"Unless all these issues are resolved to our complete satisfaction, I would advise the Commission not to sign this agreement."
"I admire the economic miracle of South Korea, which is reflected in the fact that it is the European Union's fourth largest trading partner."
"Having a strong democracy has obviously benefited them greatly, and one has to feel sorry for their brothers and sisters in North Korea."
"We should be prepared to do all we can to bring about an emotional reunion similar to the one we saw in the late 1980s between East and West Germany."
"This should, of course, be based on the principle of democracy, which has brought so much success to South Korea."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to address three aspects."
"First of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Martin, on behalf of my group."
"The report has been written with great care and it actually alludes to all the points that are important and have to be debated."
"It also advises on the appropriate caution to be exercised on certain subjects, e.g. in the automotive sector."
"In this respect I believe it is an excellent report, which is a good prerequisite and should accordingly be considered by the Commission and the Council."
"I am pleased to hear that the Commissioner has responded so meticulously to it."
"Secondly, I should like to ask the Commissioner: how will negotiations with Korea generally proceed, in your view?"
"Negotiations are indeed underway and are at a very difficult stage."
"It seemed very much better at the beginning, I believe, than we have thought in the meantime."
"Parallel negotiations with all the ASEAN nations are also being added, of course."
"These negotiations are also - as far as I have gathered from the Minutes - at a very difficult stage."
"What is the Commission's assessment of this?"
"What influence will our ongoing negotiations with ASEAN have on negotiations with Korea?"
"My last question to the Commissioner relates to the fact that the Heads of State or Government are just about to sign the Reform Treaty today, 13 December."
"Under this Reform Treaty, Parliament will in future have a great deal more influence in the retail sector, for which we in this Parliament have been fighting for a very long time."
"I should like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Mandelson in particular for always having backed this."
"My question, however, is this: can you imagine that the Commission will support us when we ask the Council for the right that has already been brought forward under the upcoming free trade agreement and that Parliament will therefore keep the relevant endorsement obligation?"
"Can we assume that we have you on our side in this, Commissioner?"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would also, on behalf of my group and very formally, like to congratulate the rapporteur David Martin on the excellent quality of the report that he is presenting to the House."
"In reality, not all reports are equal."
"It is important that, although here we vote on all sorts of documents, we point out when some of them have a content and a solidity that enable them to be examined in detail, and cover all the subjects that are up for discussion."
"I therefore congratulate the rapporteur and the team that supported him in making this happen."
"It is true that we do not talk about Korea very much here; we do not talk about it enough, although it is undoubtedly one of our major commercial allies, and indeed the fourth largest outside of Europe, as the report states."
"The European Union is the leading investor in Korea, which is also, undoubtedly, one of the strongest democracies in the whole of that region."
"If we consider what I have just said, on the one hand, therefore, and on the other hand the difficulties in the multilateral context and the reality that there are obstacles to accessing the market for European products and services, which are major non-tariff obstacles, it is obvious that this makes it a very clear candidate for a bilateral agreement that has the full support of Parliament."
"This agreement, however, needs to be well put together, well negotiated and ambitious."
"There are difficulties in very specific areas."
"I would highlight the subject of services, which has already been mentioned, and the subject of intellectual piracy, in one of the countries with the greatest Internet penetration in the world, and where, therefore, there are very specific problems resulting from the fact that copyright and rights protecting the audiovisual sphere are not taken seriously."
"Finally, on the question of Kaesong: my group is going to support the text as it is in the report; in other words, we recognise and understand the political content of this area between South Korea and North Korea, but we understand that, if free trade with the European Union were simply introduced into this context, it could cause serious problems, and therefore we would not support the simple inclusion of the Kaesong area in a possible agreement with the European Union."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, in rising to speak on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group in the debate on economic and trade relations between the European Union and Korea, I wish to draw attention to the following matters."
"In a situation where Korea has signed a Free Trade Agreement with EFTA and ASEAN and also with the United States, but will not sign such an agreement with the European Union, the competitiveness of European companies taking advantage of duty-free access to the Korean market will decline."
"This will have a negative impact on the level of economic growth and the level of employment in EU countries."
"Secondly, according to analyses carried out by independent research centres, as a result of the conclusion of a free trade agreement, two thirds of the benefits accruing from such an agreement would go to Korea, and only one third to the European Union."
"It is therefore necessary for Korea, in addition to this agreement, to make a commitment to the EU in which Korea undertakes to observe European social standards, and in particular the basic elements linked to decent work, as well as environmental and consumer protection standards."
"Thirdly, this approach gives an opportunity to lead on to honest competition between Korean and European companies."
"It is only then that Korean companies will include in their manufacturing costs the overall costs of labour, environmental protection and consumer protection, and thus the price of their products will reflect the full manufacturing cost."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, let me start by thanking Mr David Martin for his report and by underlining the crucial importance of this dossier."
"The EU-Korea Treaty will be the first application of the new EU trade doctrine Global Europe, a doctrine that is highly controversial, not least because it seeks such deep market access conditions through the removal of all kinds of barriers to all-out import penetration, precisely at a time when more and more people are becoming aware that there are very many losers as well as some winners in a completely liberalised global economy."
"On the positive side, the report sets out some very good standards for trade and social and environmental fields, which Greens absolutely support, and in that respect I think the report sets a very important precedent for further upcoming parliamentary responses to other free trade agreements, with India and ASEAN, for example."
"So we welcome the fact that the report insists that there must be no exceptions to the rule that access to the European market is conditional on compliance with environmental protection standards."
"We welcome the fact that it demands that the trade agreement with Korea incorporates binding social and environmental clauses and, to our mind, this by itself makes it difficult to contemplate that the North Korean Kaesong industrial complex would be included within the FTA rules."
"Most importantly, it intends to give teeth to those binding clauses by demanding that they are subject to the standard dispute settlement mechanism."
"But we do have some serious misgivings about this report as well."
"First, there is the demand to scrap all non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to trade without any attempt at differentiating what really constitutes a legitimate NTB and what does not."
"We should not assume that everything that prevents unfettered free trade is an illegitimate obstacle."
"There are some very good reasons to qualify trade, especially when public policy wants to put in place controls for social, health or environmental reasons."
"We are also opposed to the full introduction of the so-called 'Singapore issues' into the free trade agreement."
"Again there are good reasons why total investment freedom or public procurement should remain outside the scope of a trade agreement."
"Korea had a devastating experience with the free flow of capital in the late 1990s and they have used sheltered public procurement policies to get back on their feet since then."
"Now, it is not up to us to judge whether they should offer those items on their side, but we are allowed to judge for our side, and my Group does not support giving unlimited freedom to foreign investors in Europe or destroying the possibility of engaging in public spending for social goals through specific domestic procurement policies."
"(NL) Mr President, South Korea is one of the EU's main trading partners outside Europe, something that is highlighted clearly in this balanced report."
"It is a country that arouses sympathy owing to its contiguity with the most backward, most totalitarian communist regime in the world."
"Trade relations have grown substantially in recent years, which in itself is a very good thing, but that does not mean there are no problems."
"If we conclude a free trade agreement with South Korea, it must be based on complete reciprocity."
"South Korea still has far too many tariff and non-tariff barriers for us to really talk of reciprocity."
"Europe must insist on the elimination of all these barriers, and must be able to come to agreements that are at least as advantageous as those of the free trade agreement between South Korea and the United States."
"(DE) Mr President, as leader of the European Parliament Delegation for relations with the Korean Peninsula, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur specifically and say that I am very happy to back this report."
"I should also like to emphasise something that many still do not know: that the Republic of Korea is an important trading partner."
"Precisely for this reason it is important that we conclude a free trade agreement."
"The aim of this agreement must be to achieve fair and equitable trading conditions to our mutual advantage and our mutual benefit."
"I can also say that I am pleased that the negotiations have been running substantially better in the fifth round than they did in the fourth round."
"I should like to encourage Korea to support EU proposals for the faster and reciprocal abolition of import duties."
"The EU's target for this would be 2015."
"As we all know, the motor vehicle sector is and remains a challenge in the negotiations."
"What we as the European Union expect is that our safety standards are accepted by Korea just as we, too, accept Korea's standards in this sector."
"I am optimistic that the barriers in the pharmaceutical products and services sectors, and particularly in the banking and legal advice sectors, can be removed."
"With regard to Kaesong, I should like to say that it would be significant for the negotiating partners to find a way of supporting the Kaesong project and other projects, on economic and political grounds, particularly for introducing North Korea to the international community of states."
"We are generally on the right track and I hope that there will be a conclusion at the beginning or in the first half of 2008."
"(FR) Mr President, I would first like to thank Mr Martin for the quality of his report."
"When negotiating this future trade agreement with Korea, we would do well to remember that our priority should remain multilateralism, because we know that the excessive proliferation of bilateral agreements is damaging to the regulated multilateral structure that we belong to."
"That is why, if we enter a new era of bilateral trade agreements, these should include guarantees and principles, some of which are mentioned in Mr Martin's report."
"The future free trade agreement with Korea should be up-to-date and include restrictive environmental and social requirements such as those in the fundamental ILO conventions, which aim to promote proper working conditions."
"Moreover, following Parliament's commitment to enable better access to generic medicines, I am delighted that the provisions on public health have been included and that our wish has been respected that any demands that would limit our partners' ability to make use of the flexibilities provided for in the atypical Doha declaration agreement should not be included."
"On the other hand, despite its positive points, it is unacceptable that this text makes no reference to the fate of workers in the Kaesong free trade area, as our rapporteur wanted, and I deplore this."
"(PL) Mr President, Korea is one of the leading economies in the world, but at the same time it has the greatest difference in income among the OECD states."
"Korea is the EU's fourth largest trade partner outside Europe, whereas in 2006 the EU was the largest foreign investor in Korea."
"The main problem in our bilateral trade relations is difficulty of access to the market across non-tariff barriers, including a lack of accepted norms and international standards."
"A free trade agreement with Korea should include protection for foreign investments, a competition policy, public order transparency and trade facilitation."
"We must also bear in mind, though, that this agreement could have a negative impact on the European automobile industry, so the Commission must give careful consideration to the strategy of gradual removal of EU import duties."
"First of all, non-tariff barriers on the Korean side must be withdrawn, so that it does not turn out that the sole beneficiary of this cooperation is Korea."
"Mr President, I wish to join with the other speakers in congratulating Mr Martin on his report on a free trade agreement with South Korea, which is the EU's fourth largest trading partner outside Europe and the world's eleventh largest economy."
"I want to deal briefly with two issues."
"Firstly, the opposition of trade union and farmers' groups to the free trade agreement with Korea and, secondly, the case of the industrial zone."
"In the first case, we need to place the opposition in perspective."
"Thousands demonstrated against the US agreement with Korea and a number of people burnt themselves to death."
"Rather than thousands, we have only dozens protesting, possibly because we are attempting to include in our free trade agreement an associated political cooperation agreement - social, political and labour clauses that will help protect labour standards in the south and may well enhance them."
"At the same time, we will not have the discussion over rice which Korea had with the United States."
"With respect to Kaesong, we are not arguing that this should be included."
"We are arguing that we should not automatically exclude it."
"That is a rather different position, and I hope that on that basis the Liberals will be able to change the way they vote."
"As the former Prime Minister of Jamaica once said, the only thing worse than being exploited is not being exploited."
"Some of us had the opportunity to visit Kaesong last month, as part of an EU workshop on economic reform held in North Korea."
"I saw thousands of happy North Koreans flooding from the zone, smartly dressed, because they have standards of living six times higher than in the North."
"This is an opportunity, politically and economically, to actually change that regime and move things in the right direction."
"Kaesong can transform the North and, allowing for the difficulties, should be encouraged and not killed."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me make three brief points."
"First of all, on the issue of Kaesong, I think that Mr Ford's formulation - that we should not automatically exclude Kaesong - is the right approach to take."
"We in the Commission will be very prudent on this subject, but I think, on that basis, the amendment is probably a worthwhile one."
"Secondly, I was asked about the overall prospects for the negotiation."
"Well, in this job I have not discovered a trade negotiation that is not in some difficulty."
"However, I would say that this negotiation is in less difficulty than some other trade negotiations I could identify."
"Lastly, Ms Mann asks whether the European Parliament can obtain rights earlier than the Treaty ratification in respect of this agreement."
"When asked about this in a different context, I overstepped my collective Commission responsibility in my enthusiasm, so today I shall be a little bit more careful and simply stress that we will seek to involve Parliament as much as possible."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"1."
"Financial year 2008 as modified by the Council (vote)"
"- Financial year 2008"
"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, the second reading budget conciliation between the two arms of the Budgetary Authority was held on 23 November 2007."
"Parliament achieved a budget for results on its major objectives: financing for Galileo (EUR 2.4 billion) via a revision of the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework (MFF) and the use of the flexibility instrument (EUR 200 million); significant further use of the flexibility instrument (EUR 70 million) to finance an increase in the spending on common foreign and security policy (CFSP)."
"The Committee on Budgets voted its second reading amendments, further to the conciliation outcome, on 29 November 2007."
"After the technical check of the figures, a small number of technical adjustments were necessary to ensure full respect of the conciliation outcome of 23 November as regards revised financial framework ceilings and the overall level of payments."
"The agreed modifications are the following:"
"First, in heading 1a, commitment appropriations are adjusted as follows:"
"Amendment 335:"

"All these technical adjustments were unanimously approved by the Committee on Budgets on Monday 10 December."
"Third, a number of technical/nomenclature changes will be made, mainly as regards pilot projects and preparatory actions."
"These changes have been presented to the President of Parliament."
"These modifications do not change any figures, nor do they change any MFF classifications."
"(The technical adjustments were accepted)"
"- After the vote:"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I emphasise, before going on to comment on the results of the approval of the European Union budget for 2008, that today is a particularly pleasing day for me, not only as a European, but also as a citizen of Portugal."
"I am of course referring to that historic event - the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon - due to take place in just over an hour in my country's capital."
"Following the enlargement of the European Union to 27 Member States, it is another decisive step in European integration, that will make Europe more democratic, more representative, more flexible and effective in the way it works than it was before."
"If I might make a brief and early summing up of the achievements of the Portuguese Presidency, I would point to three important areas of success for the future of the European Union."
"They are the agreement making it possible for the EU Reform Treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon, to be signed today, the holding of the EU-Africa Summit and of the EU-Brazil Summit."
"To that we might now also add the important agreement we were able to reach on the financing of the strategic Galileo Programme."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today we have the second reading of the 2008 budget, the final stage of a long process of negotiation which finally ended very successfully."
"I am pleased to report the agreement reached between our two institutions in the concertation meeting on 23 November, that dealt in full with all the budget proposals for 2008 on which we had agreed by that date."
"In accordance with the procedures, I must point out that the Council will be able to accept the maximum rate of increase resulting from your second reading."
"I note, however, that some small adjustments are still needed as regards the classification of expenditure on which the Council reserves its rights."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to express once more my gratitude to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Böge and to the two rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä, to my colleagues in the Council, to Commissioner Grybauskaité and to all those who have helped to bring this very demanding budgetary procedure to a successful conclusion, culminating in Parliament's approval."
"Minister, you have uttered, among other things, the sentence I was waiting for."
"I therefore note that the budgetary procedure has been completed in accordance with the treaty provisions and the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006."
"I also note that, in accordance with Article 13 of the interinstitutional agreement, the Council and Parliament agree to accept the maximum rate of increase of non-compulsory expenditure that comes out of the second reading in Parliament."
"Consequently, the budgetary procedure can be declared complete and the budget definitively adopted."
"(Applause)"
"As you know, the President is currently in Lisbon where a small signature ceremony is taking place."
"My powers as vice-president end here."
"The official signature of the budget for the financial year 2008 will be on Tuesday, 18 December, at the plenary session in Brussels."

"Voting time"
"Before starting the votes, Mr Schulz has asked to speak on a point of order."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I have asked to speak on behalf of my group for two reasons: firstly, for one very general reason - on account of yesterday's events here in this House - and secondly, because I have a request in connection with the forthcoming votes."
"I should like to deal with the general reason first, however."
"Mr President, would you please issue a statement about yesterday's events on behalf of my group, particularly about the very specific case, the case concerning our ushers here in this House."
"I wish to say: it is every man and every woman's absolute right to be able to express their opinion in this House."
"We are also accustomed to seeing posters and T-shirts and to everyone being free to express their opinion here."
"Anyone who is in favour of a referendum is entitled to express this in this House."
"What we experienced yesterday, however, is not acceptable in the context of this freedom of opinion."
"(Applause)"
"We can argue here about what individual fellow Members are doing here, how they conduct themselves, whether or not they shout."
"One thing is not acceptable, however, and that is that the ushers in this House, for whom - and I speak on behalf of all my fellow Members, of almost all Members, I believe, in this House - I have the greatest personal and professional respect..."
"(Applause)"
"What is not right - and I also speak specifically on behalf of my fellow Member Mr Daul and, I think, also, on behalf of Mr Watson, Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Wurtz - is that ushers in this House are physically and verbally assaulted in a heated debate: ushers, who have been discharging the duties of their office, and were described yesterday as the Gestapo and SS."
"This is a disgrace, Mr President!"
"I think the House should express its total solidarity with the ushers."
"(Sustained applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the ushers in this House are not private individuals; they are officials of this Parliament."
"They are the long arm of the President in this House."
"When an usher is physically assaulted here, when an usher is punched here, only one thing is possible: the Member who has done this must be identified!"
"The offence must be reported to the police and his or her immunity must be removed immediately!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, on behalf of my Group I should like to address the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, particularly Mr Crowley, although I do not know whether he is here, with regard to the votes - that is, the votes on the resolutions on extremism, the EU/China human rights dialogue, Montenegro and the ban on land mines."
"The UEN Group is a co-signatory to these resolutions."
"As long as no official apology is forthcoming from the UEN Group for yesterday's incidents in this House, I see myself, as representative of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, being unable to continue to cooperate with the UEN Group."
"In particular I refer to the resolution on combating the rise of extremism in Europe."
"It was pointed out in the third recital on behalf of the UEN Group, among others, that we condemn racism in Europe and we do so with reference to the European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"This should have been signed here yesterday and was shouted down by a large proportion of the members of that group."
"Please withdraw your signature under this joint resolution."
"You cannot adopt a resolution relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which you all hooted down yesterday!"
"(Applause and uproar)"
"Yesterday you expressed the fact that you do not want this Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Remove your signature!"
"Our cooperation with you is finished!"
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have this stack of paper in front of me, which gives you an idea of the amount of work we still have to get through this morning."
"Some of my fellow Members have nevertheless asked to speak."
"I do not wish to start a lengthy debate."
"Mr Daul has asked to speak, as has Mrs Muscardini, so I will let them speak for one minute and no more."
"(Noise)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I will be very brief."
"I was in the chamber at nine o'clock this morning awaiting an apology for the personal attack on the ushers."
"As one was not forthcoming I made my statement at nine o'clock this morning, and I am not going to make it again."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been sitting in this Parliament for more than 18 years, and in this Parliament, with my fellow Members, I have always defended human and civil rights and my speeches in the Chamber and questions and motions for resolutions bear witness to this."
"I will not take lessons from Mr Schulz because Mr Schulz is not the repository of the truth, either in this Chamber or outside it."
"Democracy, Mr President, is a value that must be defended, and this includes showing respect for individuals and groups."
"I feel embarrassed for Mr Schulz because he has said things he must feel ashamed of."
"The UEN Group is behind all Parliament's officials, and particularly the ushers, who on many occasions this year have tried to defend the right to speech and expression that has so often been denied by a few majority groups in Parliament."
"For this reason, Mr President, the UEN supports the ushers, the UEN believes in fundamental rights, and the UEN calls for respect for duties and respect for people."
"Mr Schulz, take your own signature off!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, are there any other group chairmen or women here who would like to speak?"
"I deliberately say 'group chairmen or women' because I am not going to let all 785 members speak on this matter."
"I cannot see any group chairmen or women, so this item is closed."
"(Applause)"
"I will simply add something that a poet once said, which is that the most beautiful hymns are sung when bombs are falling."
"I think the one we heard here yesterday was wonderful, for that very reason!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr Salafranca wishes to speak on another matter."
"(ES) Mr President, yesterday there was a brutal terrorist attack in the city of Beirut, in which the Lebanese general François el Hajj was killed."
"As the House is aware, Mr President, Lebanon is linked to the European Union by an Association Agreement."
"At the mini-plenary session in Brussels, Parliament adopted an important report granting macro-financial aid to that country and, to take an obvious example, a delegation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, made up of Mrs De Keyser, Mrs Gomes, Mr Belder and myself, visited the country last week, so that, like various ministers from the Member States, we could express our solidarity with the cause of peace, for understanding, harmony and reconciliation in the country."
"I would ask the President to pass on our support to Prime Minister Siniora in response to this brutal terrorist attack and our unquestionable and irrevocable commitment to the cause of a sovereign, democratic, stable, viable and peaceful Lebanon."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Salafranca, I think the applause from your fellow Members shows quite clearly that the assembly supports your declaration."
"It will be passed on."
"The last request to speak is from Mr Pirker, on a point of order, and then we will proceed to the vote."
"(DE) Mr President, this does not really have anything to do with the debate, and I actually wanted to say this immediately after the last debate: it is simply unbearably cold in this House."
"It may have been quite good yesterday because feelings were not running so high there as they would perhaps otherwise have been."
"However, in general it is simply too cold and I wanted to suggest, in connection with the debate on the Free Trade Agreement with Korea, that we try to achieve a reasonable temperature perhaps once with a Korean air conditioning system, should we not manage to do so with our European one."
"I think we have covered everything we wanted to cover before launching into the vote."
"The next item is therefore Voting time."

"Calendar of part-sessions: see Minutes"
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(NL) Mr President, I should just like to say that I did not endorse the resolution on the EU/China human rights dialogue for a number of reasons."
"In particular, I think that we in this Hemicycle have already churned out more than enough overblown texts, and that the European institutions rarely, if ever, follow these overblown texts and overblown statements with action."
"With the Beijing Olympic Games around the corner, their European Excellencies will be once more attempting to curry favour with the Chinese authorities."
"This is already clear from the present resolution, which, alongside very many sensible elements, asserts that, at the recent Chinese Communist Party National Congress - and I quote - 'perspectives ... arose towards the implementation of higher international human rights benchmarks'."
"How unworldly of this House; as the reality in today's Beijing is one of intimidation, deportations, arrests and labour camps."
"It is time the European Union abandoned its policy of double standards towards China."
"(BG) I voted against the resolution on extremism because it is the fruit of that hatred it is called upon to condemn."
"And who is lecturing us on extremism?"
"Comrade Schulz and Comrade Cohn-Bendit, these champions of Marxism and Leninism, that very ideology which massacred dozens of millions of Russians and Ukrainians in the beginning of last century?"
"Or Comrade Vigenin whose party held the Bulgarian people in its clutches for fifty years and killed thousands Bulgarians in its concentration camps?"
"Are you the ones to teach us what extremism is like?"
"Thank you."
"(NL) Mr President, yes, that is the way it goes in this House."
"Unless your name is Mr Schulz, you have to use the explanations of vote to be able to express your opinions."
"This House has once again laid its periodic egg about the 'necessity' of combating 'extremism' - but is not talking about real extremism and real violence, for example that of the rising Islam in Europe."
"Instead, it is talking for the umpteenth time about curbing the freedom of expression of those peacefully standing up for the right to individuality, the right to protect and preserve our languages, identities, cultures and freedom."
"It is little short of tragic that this House is constantly speaking about freedom and human rights whilst imposing the severest, most drastic muzzling rules on people who have differing opinions on the matter and, for example, do not simply join the rest of this House in worshipping the sacred cow of the proverbial multicultural society."
"I, for my part, do not take this resolution seriously and, as far as I am concerned, there can be no freedom without total freedom of political expression."
"(NL) Mr President, I too voted against the resolution on extremism."
"This is not because I feel that the term concerns me - the reverse is true - but because, for the umpteenth time, a legitimate political discourse against further mass-immigration and for a firm adjustment policy is being consciously bound up with extremism and violence."
"Even the title of the resolution is misleading and biased."
"Left-wing extremism is evidently something that by definition cannot exist, and clearly no-one here has heard of the rising Islamic fundamentalism."
"This is straight out of Kafka."
"It would be funny if it were not so depressing."
"Anyone not falling into line with political correctness is criminalised."
"Perhaps someone could explain how this kind of thing relates to the Charter of Fundamental Rights we signed yesterday."
"(NL) Mr President, I too voted wholeheartedly against this resolution, as when the fox preaches, look to your geese."
"I have rarely set eyes on a more hypocritical document than this motion for a resolution on 'rising extremism' in Europe - and God knows that Europe and this House have already broken records for hypocrisy."
"After all, as my colleagues have already said, there is no such thing as left-wing extremism. Indeed, the finger is not even pointed at Islamic extremism."
"The suburbs of Paris burned, but the problem apparently lies with the small nonconformist minority that has become the bane of the life of this lofty institution."
"Perhaps we should open the gates of the Gulag again for those who still dare to criticise the cult of Europe and the sacrosanct multicultural society - complete with an inquisition and banishment to Devil's Island for the heretics."
"Only then will Europe be purged of its last critics, and the cult of Europe will be able to continue its conversion mission undisturbed."
"(DA) Mr President, this resolution contains a justified critique of neo-fascist and fundamentalist movements in certain European countries. However, it appears that as a whole it is unilaterally oriented towards a problem that is described as European citizens with fascist and racist attitudes, and it makes the resolution meaningless."
"Repeated opinion polls in Denmark have indicated that immigrants from non-Western nations do not feel that they are being subjected to any form of racism or hostile treatment."
"However, some immigrants from non-European nations have perpetrated very widespread violence towards both Danish citizens and other immigrants."
"In the official crime statistics, immigrants from non-Western nations are disproportionately over-represented."
"Week after week in recent months there have been many shooting incidents on the open streets involving immigrant gangs, as well as individual attacks."
"Immigrant officials, who are themselves of non-Danish ethnic origin, have had their lives threatened and been told to leave their job, not by Danes, but by people from foreign cultures, who they are trying to help integrate into Danish society."
"We have a prominent immigrant politician of Syrian origin."
"He must be protected 24 hours a day, not against Danes but against fundamentalists of an Islamic background."
"Our intelligence service is constantly involved in preventing violent attacks against Danes and Danish social institutions, not from Danes but from foreigners."
"Therefore, from a Danish perspective this resolution is absurd."
"In Denmark, violent racism is directed towards democracy and human rights."
"On this basis I have been unable to vote in favour of this resolution."
"(SK) Mr President, the Black Sea is becoming one of the main routes for increasing oil exports in this region and in recent years has unfortunately often been a place of frequent accidents involving tankers and cargo carriers."
"Twelve vessels sank or ran aground here during a severe storm."
"These events had serious consequences, affected people's lives and caused large-scale ecological disasters."
"The Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska more than 18 years ago is an example of a large-scale disaster, the consequences of which are felt to this day."
"Considering that approximately 200 tankers travel the world's seas every day, I am of the opinion that the situation should be regularly and closely monitored not only in the Black Sea but also in other seas."
"The Member States, as well as other countries neighbouring the European Union, should ensure more rigorous application of existing Community legislation and maritime safety standards."
"In this context, I am calling on the Council to speed up its deliberations and to adopt common positions on the remaining legislative acts in the third maritime package on maritime safety."
"(CS) Mr President, abolishing quotas and introducing monitoring of Chinese textile imports next year will undoubtedly result in improved control mechanisms."
"However, I do not agree that woollens should not be subject to monitoring."
"Our resolution is a political appeal to the Commission, an expression of our wish that greater emphasis be placed on demanding that international obligations are met, and it is a protest against Chinese barriers to imports of European products."
"I welcome the fact that China will have to issue import licences, which will make it possible to carry out control procedures in Chinese ports and so better protect Europe from counterfeit goods."
"At the same time it is the Commission's duty to protect European consumers against toxic substances, for example azo dyes that are sometimes present in Chinese goods."
"Therefore, I call on the Commission to push for the confiscation of textiles presenting health risks at the borders of the European Union."
"Written explanations of vote"
"The Council and the European Parliament have reached agreement on the additional financing for the Galileo satellite system and expenditure on foreign affairs, including the police mission in Kosovo."
"To this end, they have increased the 2007-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework and used the flexibility instrument, and there have also been redeployments within the existing budget lines."
"These redeployments could have been more far reaching."
"The main things I have problems with are the adjustment of the previously agreed ceiling for EU funds for the period until 2013 and the use of the flexibility instrument for this purpose."
"The use of this instrument must be avoided, and at all costs must remain limited to very exceptional circumstances."
"Any changes in costs must be primarily absorbed by reducing other budget lines."
"I am thinking mainly of the expenditure that does not concern the central objectives of the European Union and the budget lines whose implementation is already falling behind in respect of the planned expenditure."
"in writing. - (PT) The agreement reached between the Commission, the Council and Parliament for the 2008 EU budget reveals the true weight of the 'big countries' and the 'rich countries' as it responds to their demands to limit the EU budget ceiling as much as possible."
"In spite of all the attempts to hide it, the truth is that the Commission's, the Council's and the EP's proposals for the EU budget, and this agreement, were below the figure for 2008 envisaged in the 2007-2013 financial framework."
"That was also the case last year and in the 2000-2006 financial framework."
"In reality, this EU budget for 2008 represents a reduction of more than EUR 9 billion in terms of payments as compared with what was agreed in the financial framework for 2008 - that is, in terms of payments, the EU budget has been reduced from 1.04% to 0.96% of the Community GNI."
"On the other hand, the EU budget has progressively moved its priorities towards financing the neoliberal, federalist and militaristic policies of the EU."
"We therefore reject this agreement."
"in writing. - (SV) We support the basic principles of the EU budget for 2008 and stress that it must give the taxpayers good value for money."
"The frameworks set by the financial perspective must be respected and we therefore welcome the fact that the budget will be kept within these frameworks by a good margin."
"Agricultural support is one of the areas in which there is scope for cutbacks to the advantage of aims which are more in line with the Lisbon ambitions, that is that the EU should develop into the world's economically most successful region."
"in writing. - During Budget negotiations, Parliament decided with Council to redeploy EUR 50 million from the Decentralised Agencies to part-finance the European GNSS programmes (EGNOS/GALILEO) and the European Institute of Technology."
"It was not indicated which agencies would be affected."
"The reprogramming concerns the agencies under heading 1A under which Eurofound, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Working and Living standards, belongs."
"Eurofound is based in Dublin."
"This foundation provides an important service in the area of the labour market and working conditions, and a cut would be intolerable and counterproductive."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the proposed 2008 budget, firstly because the proposal is clearly in line with the principles set out in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective."
"Secondly, because the proposal put to the vote, after being negotiated with the Commission and the Council, finally overcame the serious problems that arose concerning the financing of Galileo."
"The solution to this is also very positive, making it possible to provide a reasonable level of financing for projects included in the trans-European networks."
"Thirdly, I think that the treasury solutions found are very positive as regards the budget for payments for items financing European Social Fund and European Regional Development Fund projects, which are very important for enabling Portugal to develop the projects it needs to achieve much higher rates of economic growth than in recent years and thus to come closer to the EU average."
"in writing. - (PT) Approximately 50 years ago the Council of Europe devised a system of rules and legal and judicial instruments for the purposes of protecting and promoting Fundamental Rights that has become a benchmark for Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Democracy in Europe."
"The Agency for Fundamental Rights, which is a legal successor of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, should help to enhance the coherence and consistency of EU Fundamental Rights Policy."
"Since both institutions share the same objective (strengthening the protection of Fundamental Rights), it is essential to ensure that they collaborate closely."
"This Agreement aims to ensure complementarity and added value and to avoid duplication with the activities of the Council of Europe, as laid down in Article 9 of the Regulation establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"I support the conclusion of this Agreement in a spirit of cooperation, transparency and complementarity, in particular the establishing of a cooperation framework between the two institutions entailing regular contacts and meetings, exchange of information and coordination of activities in order to avoid duplication and to guarantee the best possible use of resources."
"in writing. - (FR) The paradox, or perhaps the hypocrisy of the European Parliament, is that it goes about preaching democratic principles and values but flouts them by refusing to apply them when it is inconvenient to do so."
"Such was the case yesterday when the European Parliament, meeting in plenary, formally proclaimed the Charter of Fundamental Rights amid general uproar, thus ignoring the protests from the separatists demanding a referendum for the adoption of the new constitutional treaty."
"The European Parliament is discrediting itself by refusing any discussion and stigmatising its own elected Members who are committed to promoting the maintenance of national identity and sovereignty."
"Freedom of expression only has value if one's political opponents enjoy it too."
"According to the conservative political groups, it seems that some speech is illegitimate and needs to be prevented at any cost."
"As the European Parliament compromises itself by laying claim to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the elected Members from the Front National are stating loud and clear that they do not have the same idea of human rights and will continue to fight for respect for the sovereignty and identity of the nations of Europe."
"in writing. - (PT) I am voting in favour of the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf since it is becoming urgent to introduce a system of electronic identification for ovine and caprine animals."
"I regret the 17 month delay in the Commission proposal."
"I agree with the amendment to the Commission proposal to the effect that a specific date should be set for the system to come into force, 31 December 2009 being the most appropriate date, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's report suggests."
"I do not agree with Amendments 4 and 5 which would delay the swift implementation of the system."
"Nor do I agree with Amendment 3, since in my view the document in question aims to set a timetable rather than discuss principles."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats voted for the report since it is important to remove the current obstacles to the collection of maintenance contributions from a citizen with residence in a Member State other than that of the person entitled to maintenance."
"In this connection it is particularly important to protect the weaker party in the collection procedure."
"However, we are opposed to the wording of Amendments 9 and 26 which require the parties, after independent legal advice, to enter into a written agreement on the jurisdiction of the court and on the national law which should be applied in order that the agreement should be effective in the court."
"Such requirements are not compatible with the Swedish legal tradition."
"in writing. - (PT) Increasing mobility in the EU, combined with the growing number of couples separating, has brought an increase in the number of cross-border disputes regarding maintenance claims."
"The current procedures for obtaining maintenance claims tend to be too long and complicated and in many cases impossible in terms of obtaining results."
"In the meantime, maintenance creditors, the large majority of them children, live in very poor circumstances and often do not even have money to survive."
"This initiative is therefore very important, since it should facilitate the functioning of the internal market and freedom of movement, by the elimination of obstacles created by the discrepancies between the Member States, as regards enforcing maintenance obligations."
"It should ensure that such decisions are recognised and enforced throughout the European Union in the quickest and most effective way at the lowest possible cost."
"It will simplify citizens' lives and should at the same time have positive social effects in that it will make it easier for maintenance creditors living in another Member State to take a claim to a competent court and, once the court decision has been given, it will be recognised in all the Member States without further formalities."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I am voting in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council Regulation on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance obligations - C6-0079/2006 -."
"Mrs Grabowska is correct in her assessment that there is currently no common, harmonised system of recognition and enforcement of maintenance decisions at EU level."
"I agree with the initiative for the quick, free-of-charge enforcement of maintenance claims, especially in the context of cross-border movements of persons."
"The report rightly stresses the need for the introduction of such actions in order for a decision to have the same effect as it has in the Member State in which it was issued, without any additional formalities."
"in writing. - (PT) Since 1997, when the Ottawa Convention was signed, on the basis of data available last November, 156 States have signed the Convention."
"Significantly and regrettably, the USA is not one of those States."
"Quite correctly, the resolution adopted today points out the inconsistency between the European Commission's action in announcing its intention actively to strive for the destruction of anti-personnel mines and support for victims who for the most part, remember, are children, whilst at the same time deleting the specific anti-personnel mine budget line at the end of 2006."
"In view of the importance of this action and the fact that victim support is nowhere near sufficient to respond to their needs, we think that a specific anti-personnel mine budget line for the financing of anti-mine actions, victim assistance, and stockpile destruction should be reinstated; furthermore, we would add that there should be a substantial increase in the funds allocated."
"We regret the failure to adopt the proposal by our parliamentary group calling upon all countries to immediately halt the production of landmines and urging that under no circumstances or conditions should EU troops make use of mines."
"in writing. - (FR) I abstained on the resolution on EU-China relations because I am not keen to associate myself with these paternalistic reprimands or with the moralising discourse that resolutions of this kind convey."
"A European Union that cannot adopt a Charter of Fundamental Rights that applies throughout its territory is ill placed to try and give lessons to the rest of the world."
"in writing. - As a representative from a region, Northern Ireland, where Sinn Fein, affiliates of a terrorist organisation which recently murdered a young man, Paul Quinn, has been admitted to government in a coalition with exclusively democratic parties, I was encouraged to note and vote for Amendment 14 which was in the following terms:"
"'Deplores the fact that some mainstream parties have seen fit to give credibility and acceptance to extremist parties by entering into coalition agreements, thereby sacrificing their moral integrity for the sake of short-term political gain and expediency.'"
"in writing. - Whilst opposed to extremism in any form, UKIP does not believe that we, the British people, need to take any advice on this issue from the EU, and nor would UKIP call for the EU to take any action."
"This, like all other matters, should be the prerogative of independent, democratic nation states."

"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, we are against racism, xenophobia and political extremism."
"Recent practice in the European Parliament, where these concepts are abused in the ongoing political struggle, giving rise to a threat to free speech, a flagrant example of which was the incidents in the Hemicycle on 12 December this year, however, leads us to believe that supporters of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in which, it must be said, there is a senseless prohibition on discrimination based on 'any political opinion', at that time violated the principles they themselves propound."
"The lack of any precise definition of political extremism and xenophobia in the resolution, which is intended to combat extremism, leads us to abstain from the vote on this matter."
"in writing. - (FR) Front National, Vlaams Belang and FPOE are not extremist, racist or xenophobic parties."
"Lumping them together in a way that is unhealthy and wrong, all the so-called 'conservative' parties are still trying to accuse them of being extremists solely because they want to promote the maintenance of national identity."
"Democracy is certainly in danger, but those who are pre-appointed by the system as guilty are not the ones threatening it."
"It is not in danger from the people who criticise and challenge policies, particularly on immigration, and who are therefore accused of being extremist."
"It is in danger from those who systematically gag freedom of expression in the name of human rights and political correctness, and who are really only masking their own failure to solve the problems they are facing of immigration, lack of security and identity."
"By massively increasing the amount of legislation to combat extremism in Europe, Parliament could have been proud of helping to maintain democratic principles and values."
"Unfortunately, the opposite is true."
"Far from targeting radical Islamism or totalitarian communist regimes, Parliament is just feeding its anti-national and globalist obsession once again."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I categorically oppose racism, xenophobia and political extremism."
"I do think, though, that in documents adopted under the aegis of the European Parliament a clear definition should be provided of such terms as, specifically, political extremism and xenophobia."
"If this is not done, this may, under a noble banner, actually serve the opposite aims and become a field for abuses in politicians' public activities, drowning out free expression and the freedom to voice one's views."
"One example of such selective interpretation of these concepts was provided by the situation that arose at the European Parliament's plenary session in Strasbourg on 12 December this year."
"How, for example, does the provision of an article of the Charter of Fundamental Rights that says that 'Any discrimination based on ... political or any other opinion ... shall be prohibited' square with the forcible snatching of pieces of paper with the legend 'REFERENDUM' from the hands of Members?"
"This was a peaceful expression of opinion by a few elected Members."
"In view of this situation, I abstained from the vote on the resolution on combating rising extremism in Europe."
"in writing. - (FR) It is astounding to see how hemiplegic the European Parliament can be: it can only look right!"
"The various resolutions proposed by the PSE, Liberals, Verts or even Communists only consider extremism on the part of the 'extreme right'."
"What about radical Islamism and all those Trotskyites and communists?"
"Not once are these types of extremism mentioned."
"This is an insult for all the victims of totalitarian communist regimes and for all those who suffer on a daily basis because of the dogma and practices of radical Islamism."
"The European Parliament does not believe these types of extremism are objectionable."
"They just do not exist, because they do not form part of the current standard vocabulary of political correctness within these walls."
"Out of respect for the principles and values of democracy, equality and tolerance, the PSE Group is quick to welcome the dissolution of the extreme right-wing political group Independence, Tradition and Sovereignty (ITS) before calling for the conditions governing the formation of political groups within Parliament to be strengthened."
"The leitmotiv of these elected members is to systematically demonise their political opponents in order to impose their conservatism on everyone."
"These resolutions are a hypocritical, blind and obscurantist chore."
"We will be voting against them."
"in writing. - While I fully subscribe to genuine measures to overcome racism and extremism, this sort of resolution, generated by the Left, is not helpful and is merely intended to take forward their own distorted agenda."
"In fact, there is little to distinguish the extreme Left and the extreme Right and they feed off one another."
"However, the Left has been successful in taking the spotlight off its own extremes and promoting institutions and policies which assist its own objectives."
"The EU, in its continuous efforts to extend its own reach, is often complicit in this."
"I do not approve of EU quangos such as the so-called 'EU Agency for Fundamental Rights' or indeed funding from public money of the constellation of NGOs pushing the Left's agenda."
"I therefore abstained on the resolution."
"in writing. - I am opposed to extremism in any form, but I do not accept that the British people must take advice from the EU on this - or indeed on any other matter."
"I was not elected to have the EU extend or expand its control over the UK."
"This matter should remain in the control and prerogative of independent, democratic nation states."
"In 1918, independent Montenegro voluntarily chose unification with the neighbouring countries of Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovenia."
"In 2006, after the break-up of Yugoslavia, the electorate of Montenegro, the last state to remain united with Serbia, decided democratically to end this union."
"This made Montenegro the 49th independent state in Europe."
"Now it is important that Montenegro become a normal state, rather than a larger version of Monaco: a paradise for rich foreigners wishing to pay low taxes, launder money and build palaces."
"Montenegro must do more to combat environmental pollution and cigarette smuggling."
"I am pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has accepted my amendments concerning housing and jobs for Serbian and Kosovar refugees."
"Stateless persons cannot remain stateless for ever, and Montenegro must respect the agreements of the Council of Europe in this regard."
"Even my proposal regarding the restoration of the north-south railway connections to Nikšić on the Bosnian border and Shkoder in Albania has been accepted."
"Increasing road transport is not a valid solution."
"Fortunately, the rapporteur, Mr Vernola - unlike in his previous annual report - is not calling for swift accession to NATO, nor an economic policy that is even more neoliberal than is usual in the rest of Europe."
"Accession to NATO cannot be a prerequisite for admission to the EU."
"in writing. - (PT) The resolution adopted today in the European Parliament expresses solidarity with the victims of the shipwrecks that occurred in the Kerch Strait - that is, the Strait linking the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov - causing an environmental disaster."
"The environmental impact of the spillage of oil derivatives into the strait was exacerbated by the rapid dispersion of the pollutants due to the strong winds and high waves at the time."
"In general, we agree with the positions contained in the resolution, stressing the important role of Member States in ensuring that ships on their national registers conform to international standards and in preventing maritime accidents and combating the consequences of such accidents."
"Agreeing with the need to implement measures to reduce the environmental risk and to make progress in maritime safety, we think that any initiative taken at EU level in this framework should be based on enhanced cooperation between Member States, without compromising their responsibilities in this area."
"in writing. - (FR) The enlargement of the European Union calls for our solidarity with the population of the 431 000 km2 around the Black Sea."
"This solidarity is expressed by the agreement to open negotiations with Turkey, the implementation of the Neighbourhood Policy with Georgia and Ukraine, and the strategic partnership established with Russia."
"The violence of the storm makes us think about the effects of climate change, in our own neighbourhood too."
"A risk management policy is required that combines both prevention and the protection of biodiversity."
"We remember that the storm trapped four vessels and caused the death of eight sailors."
"A Russian cargo vessel also broke in two, releasing 4 000 tonnes of fuel oil on a migration route for diving birds coming from Siberia."
"The European Union sent a team within the framework of the Monitoring and Information Centre."
"More should be done as part of this initiative."
"To prevent future disasters, the EU must make sure that high safety standards are systematically applied to the fleet of Russian vessels."
"The EU must impose the use of double-hull cargo vessels on its Russian partner, for transporting oil."
"As the parliamentary assembly of the BSEC meets, we should be demanding the application of the standards in the European maritime safety package."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I am voting in favour of Mr Ehler's report on deposit-guarantee schemes."
"The rapporteur has presented a very good report, in which attention is drawn to the new challenges facing guarantee schemes because of the increasing integration of markets."
"These challenges must be responded to if the stability of financial markets is to be ensured."
"Deposit-guarantee schemes are a very important part in the EU financial market system and their operation should continuously be improved."
"The rapporteur rightly draws attention to the problem of crisis management and the safety net for cross-border deposits in crisis management."
"I agree that crisis management should rest on the foundations of improved early risk detection, better defined and planned procedures of interaction between all parties involved, and clarification of the point at which burdens are to be shared."
"Differences between systems and the variety of parties involved in the public and private sectors must be taken into consideration."
"in writing. - (FR) Mass imports, the perverse role played by a strong euro against a deliberately undervalued foreign currency, social and environmental dumping, counterfeits, piracy, dangerous products, and the existence of non-tariff barriers that hit European manufacturing: in the textiles sector as in others, every report and resolution by this Parliament on trade relations with China looks the same."
"Why was China's membership of the WTO accepted under these circumstances?"
"We voted against it."
"Why refuse to see that liberalising trade with countries that have decided not to obey the rules - and you never challenge this liberalisation - only leads to economic disaster and social disintegration for whole regions and sectors?"
"Why accept the end of textile quotas and the laying off of tens of thousands of European workers?"
"You are worried about it now, but you only talk timidly of possible means of commercial defence, safeguard measures and joint surveillance of exports."
"It is not much, and it is not enough, but it is better than nothing."
"Therefore, though this resolution is about as useful as a chocolate teapot, we will vote in favour."
"in writing. - (PT) We are pleased at the adoption of our proposals that:"
"maintain that the double-checking surveillance system will serve no purpose unless it prevents any repetition of the situation that occurred in 2005 and that new safeguard measures are required;"
"repeat the proposal that a Community programme should be drawn up for the textiles and clothing sector, especially for the more disadvantaged regions that depend on it, and help for SMEs;"
"We regret the rejection by the majority of the European Parliament of our proposals that, for example:"
"referred to the serious consequences of liberalisation in the textiles and clothing sector at global level with firms closing down or relocating, unemployment and serious socio-economic crises;"
"pointed out that some countries have adopted safeguard measures applying until the end of 2008, and therefore failed to understand why the EU had not followed suit;"
"maintain that a regulatory framework needed to be laid down to penalise company relocations, making public aid to businesses subject to long-term commitments regarding regional development and employment, including the requirement to pay back aid if such conditions were not met;"
"called for a stronger role for workers' representatives in company boards and in fundamental organisational decision-making."
"in writing. - (FR) The textile sector in France and in Europe since the end of the Multi Fibre Arrangement has turned some of our regions into economic and social deserts."
"Poverty and deprivation reign there for the thousands of men and women who have lost their jobs."
"The destruction of these companies, of this social fabric, in the name of globalisation and pro-European ultraliberalism, is the symbol of one of the greatest economic failures of the European Union."
"For years, this approach has led to our manufacturing in all economic sectors, even where it was of a very high standard, being relocated to other countries throughout the world: to North Africa and especially to Asia."
"This global rebalancing will not actually have given these third countries anything, except to worsen economic slavery for the benefit of a small elite in Chinese factories and to establish long-term unemployment in Europe against a background of persistent economic crisis."
"Clearly, global competition, as encouraged by the WTO, is the main reason for the widespread impoverishment and lack of dynamism of Europe."
"The European Union urgently needs to put an end to this madness, and finally to set up Community protection and preference."
"in writing. - (PT) Amongst other things, this report contains a veritable misconception."
"It acknowledges that 'poverty remains an unresolved and deepening problem in Korea which, according to OECD statistics, ranks among the three OECD members with both the biggest income gap and the greatest widening of the income gap' (we might add that it is not the only case, since within the EU the income gap between rich and poor has also widened, particularly in Portugal, where the difference between the richest and the poorest continues to grow, with approximately two million Portuguese living on the breadline)."
"The report nevertheless calls for a 'free trade' agreement between the EU and Korea and for trade liberalisation, when it is known that such policies have favoured and will continue to favour the concentration of wealth on the large economic and financial groups both in the EU and in Korea."
"It is an agreement which will serve to place workers under even greater pressure to accept low salaries and lose rights and social advances gained in the name of 'competitiveness', and to increase the fabulous profits of the few."
"In the meantime there is no mention of the shipbuilding industry..."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I am voting in favour of accepting Mr Martin's report on the trade and economic relations with Korea."
"The rapporteur has drafted a very good report, in which he points out the importance of Korea as a trading partner for the European Union in economic terms."
"Conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement with Korea is part of the strategy to provide Europe with a global dimension."
"A Free Trade Agreement between Korea and the European Union could constitute a basis for the promotion of high social and environmental standards and could serve as an example for other agreements that are currently at the negotiation stage."
"I agree that every effort must be made to ensure that the European Union and Korea - under the aegis of the trade agreement currently being negotiated or through a separate agreement - themselves take on human rights obligations."

"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the minutes: see Minutes"
"1."
"Eastern Chad"
"The next item on the agenda are the six motions for a resolution on eastern Chad."
"author. - (PL) Madam President, I would like to say that I am very disturbed by the intensification of fighting in Chad, but also by the lack of progress in finding a political solution to the conflict."
"I would therefore like to draw particular attention to the role of the EUFOR TCHAD/RCA operation."
"The main aim of the European initiative, which is also supported by the UN, is to ensure security in the humanitarian zone."
"Bearing in mind the ongoing Darfur crisis and the way in which it is destabilising the situation in the region, it is worth remembering here that the conflict has already crossed the borders of Chad and the Central African Republic."
"I believe it is vital to put neutral forces from the Member States in place as soon as possible."
"I would like to stress, though, that the success of such a peace mission is heavily dependent on the political efforts that must be made if a successful peace process is to be conducted."
"author. - Madam President, I want to make a couple of important and essential points."
"There is absolutely no doubt that intervention is required in Chad."
"There is no doubt that the teeming human misery of refugees in that part of our world is unbearable to see, but I want to state very clearly that there are a number of core difficulties with this proposed mission."
"The first of these is the lack of clarity in terms of the operation's mandate."
"We are saying that this is a peace-keeping and humanitarian effort."
"If that is indeed so, then this must be made doubly clear in the terms of reference for the troops we send."
"I believe that clarity is lacking."
"I do not believe - and I have to disagree with my colleague - that an intervention shaped in this way will actually increase security."
"We have recently witnessed a growing intensity and barbarity of the conflict."
"We have also heard from leaders of many of the rebel groups that any intervention, and this intervention in particular, will be considered hostile."
"That poses a huge difficulty."
"I must also say - and, again, I disagree with my colleague - that the troops as currently configured will not act as the neutral force that is required."
"I have to say, with the greatest of respect for France and her people, that to load the mission so much towards France verges on the provocative, and I think it deeply unwise."
"I do not believe that it is possible for us to formulate a common European defence or security policy."
"The difficulties that have arisen - in this instance in relation to Chad - reflect very clearly why."
"I think it is undoable, because we have very different traditions and histories and very different foreign policy goals and outlooks."
"For this reason in particular it is a great shame - if I may say so, coming from a country that is still at least nominally militarily neutral - that the obligations, responsibilities and capacities of militarily neutral states are not recognised sufficiently in the European Union, and particularly not in the Lisbon Treaty."
"I believe that countries with that tradition could make the kind of valued intervention based on neutrality that my colleague has mentioned."
"To conclude, intervention in Chad is necessary."
"However, the essential thing is how we go about this."
"Any operation has to be focused."
"It certainly has to be neutral and, above all, it must have prospects of success."
"Madam President, I notice that there is no time displayed on the board."
"Does that mean we will have the privilege of unlimited use of time this afternoon, or is there a technical error?"
"Mr Matsakis, we shall all abide by the time we know has been given us."
"author. - Mr President, I initiated this urgency resolution in order to exert political and public pressure on getting the EU peacekeeping mission to the eastern Chad border region deployed as soon as possible."
"The recent unrest in eastern Chad, including heavy clashes between rebel fighters and the Chadian army, underscores the urgent need for our presence in this region to protect innocent refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) from getting caught in the crossfire."
"These military offences are exacerbating criminality and leading to increased insecurity around the IDP camps."
"Not only is access to the camps being impeded for humanitarian personnel, but they are wrestling with the problem of banditry, restricting their ability to provide much needed humanitarian assistance."
"I call on the EU and its Member States to honour the political decision made and to provide this mission with more troops and appropriate financial, logistic and air support, including the necessary number of helicopters, as soon as possible."
"The EU's credibility in its foreign policy on the world stage is at stake if it cannot mobilise sufficient troops and equipment to make this mission operational."
"This is an EU peacekeeping mission and therefore concerns all EU Member States, whether they are participant countries or not."
"I would like here and now to dispel the myth that this mission will be French dominated."
"This mission has troops coming from Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, Austria and Ireland."
"Furthermore, it will not be French led but Irish led."
"Irish Lieutenant General Pat Nash has been appointed to front this mission, and he will therefore be calling the shots - excuse the pun - concerning troop activities on the ground."
"This operation is going to go ahead, and such remarks are simply not helpful when it comes to aiding this mission's perception and eventual reception among the local population in Chad and among the rebel groups."
"There have been some hopeful signs of movement this week from other EU Member States, following Ireland's appeal for this mission to be adequately resourced."
"It appears that one country has offered medical supplies, while other Member States are discussing providing funding to assist other countries to supply necessary logistical support, including aircraft."
"Another fourth-generation conference must be called immediately to come up with the necessities to protect our troops in the field so that they can go about their important job of protecting refugees. The time to act is now."
"author. - (FR) Madam President, the resumption of fighting between rebel and government forces in Chad has left hundreds dead and wounded and caused renewed tensions in the border region of Sudan and the Central African Republic."
"This situation has, de facto, restricted access to refugee camps for thousands of people and made the task of humanitarian aid workers considerably more complicated."
"I should also remind you that at present in this region of the world, women and children are still the victims of particularly odious violence and that there are already more than 450 000 displaced people living in terrible conditions precisely where the conflict has restarted."
"Against this background, we can obviously demand that the warring factions cease all combat, particularly where civilian populations are affected."
"We also demand that they respect the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, which means respecting humanitarian areas and allowing the transportation of aid, as well as not attacking humanitarian personnel."
"More generally, we are also particularly concerned about the fact that humanitarian law is more and more often flouted, if not totally ignored, by the parties involved in the conflicts."
"The European Union needs to act specifically against this worrying development."
"We also urge the authorities in Chad to systematically do all they can to prosecute those responsible for rape, war crimes and all forms of serious human rights violation."
"However, I would say that our message is mostly aimed at the European Union, particularly the Council of Ministers, by which we undoubtedly have more chance of being heard and which we ask to assume its responsibilities."
"On 15 October, the Council adopted a joint action on the EUFOR Chad/RCA operation to provide protection for civilians, humanitarian aid, and security for local and expatriate humanitarian personnel."
"Just two months later, the deployment of EUFOR troops has still not materialised, due to a lack of resources and sufficient equipment."
"This is unacceptable and the Council and Commission therefore urgently need to speed up the decision-making process to enable this operation to be conducted as rapidly as possible."
"I would also like to point out that no peacekeeping mission in eastern Chad or the northern part of the Central African Republic will be effective without a general reconciliation process involving the whole region."
"We already know that EUFOR's presence on Sudan's doorstep will make it more difficult for the rebels to circulate freely across borders and will therefore cause the displacement of some attacks."
"The urgent and essential support that the European Union is committed to providing could therefore very quickly prove inadequate."
"It is now also essential for the EU to do everything it can to encourage the resumption of peace talks at regional level, in partnership with all those involved in the conflict and the various representatives of the international community."
"Finally, I would like to point out that we believe that the European force's neutrality is particularly important and very strategic here."
"Since the rebels have already threatened to target it if it is simply a French mission in disguise, we are asking the other Member States to participate en masse in the composition of this force, so it is clear to everyone that it is indeed a European force."
"author. - Madam President, eastern Chad has become a second Darfur, and the déjà vu scenes of killings and destruction committed against innocent civilians are coming back to haunt us."
"Meanwhile, we in the EU, being part of the privileged elite of this world, debate endlessly amongst ourselves on how to deal with the situation."
"While we - most wisely, but very slowly - consider and reconsider our decision to send an effective peacekeeping military force to the region, those criminals who carry out ethnic cleansing continue their despicable acts unhindered."
"One important - perhaps the most important - message that must come out of this debate today is our strong demand to the Commission and Council that EUFOR must be properly set up and deployed to the affected region most urgently."
"Those in the Council or Commission, or elsewhere for that matter, who delay this action would be responsible for the further escalation of violence and tragedy that will inevitably follow soon."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, I think that it is particularly significant that the three urgent resolutions that we are debating today have something in common in that they concern different types of violence against women."
"This demonstrates that this type of violence is something that affects the whole world, although it has particular manifestations and forms in each case."
"The first of the three cases that we are dealing with today, the situation in Chad, is a sad example of how, in a context of war, women frequently tend to be used as sexual objects, where rape becomes a weapon of war. This situation occurs especially in refugee camps, but not only there."
"The aim of this resolution is, at least for some of us, to point out that the international community, and in particular the European Union, needs to respond to this situation and take on our responsibility to protect the victims."
"With this in mind, the deployment of a specific mission, EUFOR Chad/CAR, is a task that certainly needs to be done urgently, but also responsibly."
"I would like to join with those pointing out that there is definitely a risk that the mission will be perceived as being excessively linked to one country, namely France."
"I think that this would be damaging, and certainly counterproductive for the objectives of the mission."
"I would therefore also like to stress that the composition of the mission should reflect the diversity of the European Union Member States, in order to avoid any confusion between that mission and the French deployment known as Operation Sparrowhawk."
"We also need to condemn before all possible bodies, and I therefore urge the Council and the Commission to do this, the brutality of the attacks perpetrated on the civilian population by the Janjawid militias and other Chadian groups."
"What is especially deplorable is the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, and it is unacceptable for such crimes to go unpunished."
"I therefore urge the Chadian authorities to take responsibility for investigating these rapes and abuses and to bring those responsible to justice."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, it has been said of the last Bourbon kings that they always took action too late on an idea, a government or an army."
"This unfortunately seems to be the case today for the West and for Europe, because we have already allowed the catastrophe in Darfur and in eastern Chad to go on far too long."
"The later we intervene, the more costly it becomes, not just financially, but militarily and politically as well."
"I am therefore very grateful to Mr von Wogau for moving matters ahead decisively on military and security policy and I am very grateful to Mr Dess for doing the same in the humanitarian sector."
"We ultimately have to take action. However, the nations are procrastinating, not only on the equipment required, but also on the troops required."
"We need troops and forces on the ground with local knowledge and experience."
"I am very much of the opinion that there should be no disguised French operation, which nobody is talking about either, but we do need the local knowledge and experience of the French."
"We also, however, need the cooperation of the African Union and the Arab League, which are unfortunately still keeping completely aloof."
"This should not, however, absolve us Europeans of our responsibilities."
"I say very clearly: we want to get involved but we must not make the mistakes we made in Afghanistan, namely intervening without having a political strategy."
"Anyone who intervenes there must also know that they must have a strategy for peace talks, for interethnic discussions and for a solution to the massive tribalism and other conflicts that exist both in eastern Chad and in Darfur along the artificial borders."
"As the European Parliament, we should therefore be campaigning for the deployment of troops and for humanitarian aid, but we should also be making our contribution as quickly as possible to a sustainable political peace strategy for the region."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I will be very brief."
"The second EU-Africa Summit was a complete failure: the two parties did not reach an Economic Partnership Agreement, and relations between those two parts of the world have been frozen."
"The tense situation in eastern Chad has not helped much either."
"One of the prerequisites for fruitful cooperation would be an end to the decades-long military conflicts in Africa."
"When resolving the conflict in eastern Chad, the European Union must demonstrate that we are determined to reach a peaceful solution and send our peacekeeping military mission to eastern Chad as soon as possible."
"(NL) Madam President, last weekend an EU-Africa Summit was held in Lisbon."
"This intended to develop the basis for a new partnership between Europe and Africa: a partnership that, according to the joint declaration of the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament, was to be based on shared values and principles, such as democracy, human rights and good governance."
"Unfortunately, however, Europe's attitude to individuals such as Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya - to name but two; they were both welcomed with a red carpet - proves that there is still a yawning chasm between declarations of principle and reality."
"The situation in Chad today also shows, if proof were needed, that a large proportion of Africa is far from ready to form part of this 'community of shared values'."
"Therefore, if we Europeans want to remain credible with our discourse on human rights and not simply practise realpolitik, an intervention should indeed send out a clear signal that lawlessness and arbitrariness must make way as quickly as possible for the most basic democratic principles."
"Unfortunately, the assessment of Chad also applies to a great many other regimes in Africa."
"Chad is not the only sick man of Africa."
"Thank you for the clarification."
"I am required to announce the speakers who have registered to speak on behalf of their political groups."
"Your political group, like everyone's here, is not in doubt, and everyone here knows which group you represent."
"(FR) Madam President, to correct what you have just said about the last intervention: the PSE Group spoke through me;"
"I was speaking as the author and on behalf of the PSE Group."
"I would not like anyone to think that we were not concerned about this issue."
"Madam President, we are all very aware of the appalling humanitarian and security situation in eastern Chad."
"This cannot be separated from the wider regional catastrophe in Darfur: 300 000 people massacred, two million displaced persons, four million people living on Western food aid."
"For three years now, the international community has been wringing its hands."
"I recognise that the European Union has sponsored large-scale humanitarian aid to the region."
"That is the good side."
"Politically, the EU's contribution is less commendable."
"It fêtes the Sudanese dictator Omar El Bashir in Lisbon, along with Mugabe the oppressor of Zimbabwe, where in the ultimate sickening act of hypocrisy they sign up to a declaration on human rights and good governance."
"The EU's other contribution is to try and engage in some half-baked military mission in order to stick the ESDP badge on another military operation."
"The fact is this proposed mission is poorly conceived; the size of the force is inadequate; it lacks vital medical, logistic and transport support elements; it is already three months behind schedule and there is no contingency reserve if the situation should deteriorate even further."
"We need only look at the random involvement in this mission - what is after all a largely French-driven operation - to understand why many in Chad, Sudan and the Central African Republic, let alone our own military officers, have a seriously sceptical attitude towards this project."
"Soldiering should be left to others."
"As a matter of urgency it is the UN-AU effort that should be reinforced as part of a coherent strategy for the whole region."
"This should be politically driven by the UN Security Council."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is looking very carefully at the worsening security situation in eastern Chad and is emphatic in its support for the deployment of EUFOR troops in full strength to protect refugees and displaced persons in the region."
"The European Union will use every instrument at its disposal in eastern Chad to do this."
"The Commission will provide not only EUFOR troops, but also more than EUR 50 million as part of a comprehensive plan."
"With these funds, measures will be financed in the following three key areas, which extend from emergency aid to long-term development aid."
"The first sector concerns humanitarian aid, for which ECHO has already provided EUR 30.5 million in 2007 in the form of emergency aid measures for supporting refugees and displaced persons in different sectors in Chad."
"A similar level of funding has also been set aside to continue these measures in 2008."
"The second sector comprises the organisation of a Chadian police force, which will be responsible for carrying out humanitarian protection measures."
"In the context of the EU and UN missions in Chad, the United Nations are setting up, training and equipping up to 850 Chadian police forces and constabularies, which are to be deployed in refugee camps in eastern Chad."
"The European Union is supporting this UN programme with EUR 10 million from the Instrument for Stability."
"The third sector concerns reintegration and rehabilitation."
"In 2008 the Commission will be providing EUR 10.1 million from the ninth European Development Fund for development measures promoting reconstruction, conflict resolution and the organisation of administrative capacities."
"These are measures that are necessary for improving the security situation in the areas of the UN-EU mission."
"Further measures are planned as part of the 10th European Development Fund, for which EUR 311 million are estimated from 2008 to 2013."
"Returning displaced persons to their home country should be supported in the short term with these measures."
"Their aim in the long-term is to stabilise the situation permanently in Chad and throughout the region."
"The previous speakers have rightly referred to the flare-up in the battles between government-friendly rebels and President Idriss Déby's troops in eastern Chad, which has clearly made humanitarian aid more difficult."
"Even in the areas around the refugee camps, safety can no longer be guaranteed."
"In addition, the precarious humanitarian situation is coming increasingly to a head owing to the rapid increase in the number of refugees from the combat zones."
"In this deeply worrying situation, the restoration of security in the region is a task of the utmost urgency."
"In order to cope with this task, a military presence is vital."
"EUFOR troops should therefore be deployed specifically in these crisis areas."
"They will, however, be successful only if the causes of the conflict are eliminated and if a political process is introduced at the same time, with the aim of calming the underlying tensions and reducing poverty by facilitating economic development."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at the end of the debates."
"2."
"Women's rights in Saudi Arabia"
"The next item is the six motions for a resolution on the rights of women in Saudi Arabia."
"author. - (PL) Madam President, referring again to the October 2006 incident, while at the same time bearing in mind the lack of legal protection for women in Saudi Arabia, but above all on the basis of facts that have again been demonstrated by expressions of social condemnation of the voice of rape victims attempting to bring about a public debate on this subject, I call on the Saudi Arabian authorities to cease this type of practice forthwith."
"Madam President, I would like to stress that the European Union should not remain silent in the face of the scandalous violation of the rights and personal liberties of women in third countries."
"A state responsible for protecting its citizens may not resort to breaches of principles of the rule of law under the pretext of standing guard over maintenance of the principle of independence of the courts, as happened in the case of the sentence passed on the woman from Qatif."
"I am therefore calling for a redoubling of efforts on the part of the government of Saudi Arabia in the matter of observing women's basic rights."
"author. - (SV) Madam President, I have to say that it is immensely sad that abuse of and violence against women never seem to cease."
"This applies to both this Resolution and the next one."
"I want to thank all who have helped to bring this Resolution into being."
"It is almost inconceivable that women in Saudi Arabia are, in 2007, still deprived of all human rights."
"It is apparently not enough that women have to be subjected to degrading and scandalous gang rapes."
"They also have to be punished by the authorities, while the perpetrators go free."
"I think that all of us, both women and men, must do all we can in the name of solidarity to ensure that human rights apply to women in Saudi Arabia too."
"We call on the Commission and the Council and of course all the Member States to raise these matters in contacts of all kinds with Saudi Arabia."
"We have a multitude of international conventions and we have had pronouncements from the EU in many contexts."
"Sometimes it is frustrating that we talk and talk and this violence just goes on and on."
"Thanks to everyone who took the initiative and helped in the work on this Resolution."
"author. - Madam President, recently King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia was afforded a controversial state visit to the United Kingdom."
"Our Deputy Foreign Minister praised the shared values of the UK and Saudi Arabia."
"I found this sycophancy absurd, as my values of democracy, human rights and gender equality are alien to Saudi tradition."
"Of course, the EU's relationship with the House of Saud is based on regional stability and on important commercial ties, in particular oil and arms trading."
"In fact, the relationship is so important that a three-year UK inquiry into alleged bribes paid to Saudi ministers by an arms contractor was killed by orders of Prime Minister Tony Blair on the grounds of national security."
"Worryingly, Saudi Arabia's brand of fundamentalism, Wahabi Islam, is being exported globally."
"In London - my constituency - textbooks at a Saudi-funded school were found to contain hate-filled passages about Christians and Jews."
"This case of the Qatif gang-raped woman sentenced to 200 lashings has horrified the world."
"Parliament's joint motion for a resolution expresses revulsion and repudiation of the Kingdom's values."
"Twenty years ago a British TV documentary similarly recounted a story of a Saudi princess who was publicly executed for adultery."
"The EU and Saudi Arabia have shared vital foreign policy interests, such as supporting the Middle Eastern peace process, encouraging the Saudis as Sunni Muslims to contain expansionist Shia Iran and supporting the Saudi fight against al-Qa'ida, many of whose adherents, unfortunately, come from Saudi Arabia originally."
"But we also need to hold the Saudis to their UN Convention obligations to remove discrimination against women, who cannot even drive a car or vote in their limited local elections."
"But let us not kid ourselves that we share values with this fundamentalist and medieval regime."
"author. - Madam President, I will speak in a personal capacity on this matter."
"Saudi Arabia is governed by a ruthless dictatorship which is, to a large extent, shamefully legitimised in most of the Western world, including many EU countries, because Saudi Arabia is immensely rich in petrol dollars, some of which it uses in Western states in order to bribe them into pretending not to see, not to hear and not to understand what is going on in that country."
"But even schoolchildren know that the comical rulers of Saudi Arabia, consisting mostly of the family of one man, His Most Royal Excellency godlike King Abdullah, are imposing on their people a brutal repression."
"One obvious example is that they treat women as slaves or as pieces of domestic furniture yet, as mentioned just now by Mr Tannock, Mr Abdullah and his six plane-loads of entourage were given a lavishly glorious state welcome in the UK and the Vatican only a few weeks ago."
"And not a single word about human rights managed to escape through the honourable lips of the Queen of England, or the UK Prime Minister, or the Pope."
"So much for hypocrisy and double standards, one might be tempted to say."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, back in 2005 we had the opportunity to talk about the situation of women in Saudi Arabia, and in that context we did so in relation to the municipal elections and the fact that women were unable to vote."
"As well as this discrimination in terms of political rights, however, there are many other types of discrimination that have been reported in various media, recently and continuously, which motivated this second resolution that we are debating today."
"The trigger was certainly the incomprehensible sentence passed against a women, known as 'the Qatif woman', who was sentenced to 200 lashes for having been found in a car talking to a man who was not part of her family."
"Not only are the alleged crime, and hence the sentence, unacceptable, but they are also aggravated by the fact that the convicted woman was unable to receive adequate legal advice."
"Unfortunately this is not the only case in which one can deplore clearly discriminatory sentences for crimes and the failure to defend women in the legal system."
"This is, unfortunately, more the norm than the exception."
"How can a system be considered fair, for example, when it finds the victim of a rape guilty of that atrocity?"
"Structural change is needed in Saudi Arabia, and the European Union needs to help those who are working both outside and within the country to achieve this."
"There are no relativisms here that carry weight."
"Human rights, which include women's rights, are and need to be universal and defended in any context."
"I therefore join in the request made by Mrs Svensson, and I ask the Commission and the Council once again to take any opportunity they can to ask the Saudi authorities to make the appropriate structural and institutional changes, in order to eliminate any form of discrimination against women, including recognising all their rights, in both private and public life, and more specifically, in the political, legal and judicial spheres."
"author. - (PL) Madam President, Saudi Arabia is a country in which the law is put into effect according to Wahabi principles, this being the most radical Sunni trend in Islam."
"Political, social and religious freedom is significantly restricted, and punishments by flogging, the amputation of hands or feet or the death penalty are meted out on a daily basis."
"In a country that has been called 'a human rights desert' by Human Rights Watch, it is mainly women who fall victim to numerous forms of discrimination in private and public life."
"The identity of women was only formally recognised in 2001, by issuing them with identity documents containing a photograph."
"Before that they would prove their identity using a family identity document bearing a photograph of their husband or father."
"Even if they can afford a car, they are not allowed to drive it."
"They may study, but lectures given by men are watched by female students on video."
"They are deprived of the right to vote, and decisions on divorce and child care are the exclusive prerogative of men."
"Women are repeatedly the victims of unjust and offensive court verdicts."
"The instance of the girl from Qatif concerns a 19-year-old gang-rape victim who was condemned to 200 lashes and six months in prison for being alone with a strange man at the time of her abduction."
"Despite having signed it, Saudi Arabia does not observe the obligations arising from the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women."
"The authorities must start by lifting all restrictions on women where freedom of movement is concerned and take steps towards gradually increasing the involvement of women in political decision-making on an equal footing with men."
"Women must have general access to employment at all levels of administration and the opportunity to carry out all public functions."
"The introduction of a total ban on the use of flogging and other degrading corporal punishment must also be demanded, as this is a violation of international law and the UN Convention against Torture, to which Saudi Arabia is a signatory."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Madam President, I should like to add my voice to those of all the other members who have spoken and in particular to point out that we are celebrating the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, and equal opportunities, by definition, can have no borders, and we simply cannot remain indifferent to what is happening to women in Saudi Arabia and also in the rest of the Middle East as a whole."
"I should like in particular to take up a question raised by Mr Tannock concerning specifically the right to drive a car."
"The Committee of Demanders of Women's Right to Drive Cars was set up in Riyadh on 27 September."
"On 6 November the committee commemorated the 17th anniversary of the demonstration against this ban, it has already collected a thousand signatures, and it has enormous strength."
"It is led by four Saudi women."
"I should like to call on the whole House, in particular the Presidency, to lend full support to this Saudi Arabian initiative and I should also like to remind you that, in addition to Saudi Arabia, there are at the moment even more serious situations in Iraq."
"I would remind you of the execution this year in Basra of 40 women for failing to respect the dress code currently being imposed in Iraq, a country where women had the vote before the women of Portugal did, and where today the most barbarous fanaticism is being introduced."
"We cannot remain indifferent to that situation either."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, when addressing the issue of women's rights in Saudi Arabia, there is something that we need to keep in mind."
"This is that in Islamic societies there is no separation of religion and state."
"The state is the religion and vice versa. The lack of regard for women's rights derives from Islamic law, and by comprehending and taking into account this simple fact we might move a step closer to improving the situation."
"We cannot impose our values, which have gone beyond our Judaeo-Christian traditions, but we can open a dialogue calling for mutual understanding and preparing the ground for a reform, as several conceptions that do not correspond to our worldwide view are now being disproved."
"Having said that, the situation of women in Saudi Arabia is dreadful, and something needs to be done urgently."
"I therefore urge my colleagues to support this report unanimously."
"(NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the discussion we are holding here today on Saudi Arabia, particularly the dreadful situation regarding women's rights, should actually be extended to cover a large part of the Islamic world."
"Only a few, such as the Dutch citizen Ayaan Hirsi Ali, dare come out with it."
"The discrimination and subjugation of women is rooted in the holy texts of Islam itself."
"Discrimination against women in Saudi Arabia and almost throughout the Islamic world has its basis and justification in the Koran."
"This is a fundamental truth that we must dare to acknowledge in this debate."
"It was demonstrated just recently in Sudan, where a 54-year-old teacher was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment for calling a teddy bear Mohammed, until being pardoned thanks to pressure from international diplomacy."
"In Saudi Arabia, a 20-year-old woman fell victim to gang rape but was herself convicted."
"It does not get any more symbolic than that."
"However, Saudi Arabia is an ally of the US, of course, and can get away with that bit more."
"After all, like China, Saudi Arabia is a rich country and we can venture to be rather more flexible when the noble principles we have been discussing so often this week are at stake."
"Europe should thus also call on Washington to throw all its weight behind improving the situation in Saudi Arabia."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is extremely grateful for the opportunity to be able to say something today about the situation regarding women's rights in Saudi Arabia."
"The case underlying your resolution gives us cause for the greatest concern. A young woman was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months' imprisonment after being gang-raped by seven men."
"The EU dealt with this matter immediately."
"The EU Troika made representation to the Saudi Arabian Government in Riadh and expressed the EU's dismay at the verdict of the court in El Katif."
"The verdict is not only clearly in breach of Saudi Arabia's international obligations, particularly against the UN Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, but also turns the principle of guilt upside down by declaring the victim to be guilty."
"This case brings under the spotlight a country in which discrimination against women is unfortunately part of everyday life."
"The European Parliament has justifiably asked the Saudi Arabian Government on several occasions to remove the limitations on women's free movement, including the driving prohibition."
"This request also applies to the restrictions on women's access to employment, on their legal personality and on their representation in judicial processes."
"I unreservedly share Parliament's concerns about the situation of women in Saudi Arabia."
"At the same time Saudi Arabia is bound as a member of the UN Human Rights Council to protect and promote human rights."
"Saudi Arabia is a contracting party to the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women."
"Admittedly it has ratified the Convention with one reservation: in the event of a conflict between the clauses of the Convention and the standards of Islamic law, the Kingdom is not obliged thereafter to comply with any clauses of the Convention conflicting with this law."
"The European Union has repeatedly called on Saudi Arabia to lift its reservations on this UN Convention - particularly with regard to granting equal rights for women and men in relation to the nationality of their children - and will continue to do so."
"Human rights issues such as the situation of women are regularly the subject of representations by the European Union to Saudi Arabia."
"The European Union is reminding Saudi Arabia of its obligations according to international human rights standards, is broaching the issue of the need to treat women and men equally and to combat violence against women and is asking Saudi Arabia to protect and promote women's rights."
"Two recent changes that we have observed could - I say this very cautiously - could perhaps be a sign that Saudi Arabia is, making some progress."
"The Saudi Arabian National Society for Human Rights produced its first report on the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia in May of this year."
"Violations of the rights of women, prisoners and workers are published in this report, as are court judgments."
"The results and recommendations of this report should be acted on and followed up without fail by the Saudi Arabian Government"
"Furthermore, in October King Abdullah announced a fundamental judicial reform, reinforcing the independence of judges and simplifying fact-finding according to Sharia law supervised by the Supreme Court."
"For a country like Saudi Arabia, these are encouraging steps."
"We should therefore not only be drawing attention to human rights violations in Saudi Arabia where necessary, but also be welcoming and supporting the reforms that have recently been discreetly emerging."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at the end of the debates."
"3."
"Justice for the ""Comfort Women"""
"The next item is the five motions for a resolution on justice for comfort women."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, I have to say that, as the driving force behind this resolution, I am particularly satisfied that finally we have found the space and sufficient consensus to table it, because I sincerely believe that the subject deserved this, and much more."
"We are talking about almost 200 000 women, euphemistically known as 'comfort women', who were forced to be sexual slaves during and before the Second World War by the Japanese Imperial Army."
"After 62 years, the survivors are still seeking justice."
"During their lives they have suffered from poor physical and mental health, isolation and shame, and often extreme poverty."
"So far the Japanese Government has not complied with international rules on reparation, which include restitution, compensation, rehabilitation and satisfaction, including full disclosure, apology and guaranteeing that the action will not be repeated."
"This is particularly significant given that Japan is one of the main donors of aid in post-war times."
"There was, therefore, an urgent need to react and to point out, as the survivors do, that truth must be linked to justice, and that an apology is empty if it is not accompanied by an acceptance of responsibility."
"I would like to stress that this is not only about the rights of an individual victim, but about collective rights, which bring with them the responsibility to remember, so that this type of violation does not happen again."
"This means that we must ask the Japanese to conduct an exercise in historical honesty and not only acknowledge the facts but apologise on behalf of their predecessors, and to compensate the victims."
"Finally, I would like to express my great respect and recognition for the women who had and continue to have the courage to speak out and demand justice, and for the organisations like Amnesty International that are supporting them on this journey."
"author. - (SV) Madam President, the Resolution calls for justice and redress for the hundreds of thousands of women, so-called 'comfort women', who were forced into providing sexual services before and during the Second World War."
"All these degraded women who were held in sexual slavery are still waiting for justice and redress."
"The Japanese authorities have indeed done a certain amount but, as the Resolution shows, a great deal remains for the Japanese Government and authorities to do in order to give those women justice and redress."
"The majority of the women who were forced into this dreadful situation were very young at the time."
"That means that their whole lives have been destroyed by these terrible experiences."
"They have been forced to live out their lives in poor physical and psychological health, isolation, shame, and often extreme poverty."
"The fact that these women have not had full justice and redress also means that those who committed these crimes have effectively enjoyed immunity for their acts."
"Again the victims, women, are punished while the perpetrators go free."
"This Resolution is also important for the reason that it highlights what always happens in war and conflict zones, that it is always women who are the main victims."
"It is therefore important that we draw attention to this matter."
"We must try to put a stop to this."
"author. - (PL) Madam President, when we talk about crimes and when we think about crimes of the 20th century, we think above all of the crimes committed by the Germans and the Bolsheviks, or rather, to put it more broadly, the Communists."
"In Europe we are less aware of the fact that in the Far East Japan committed immense crimes from the 1930s until the end of the war."
"One of the greatest of these crimes was the sexual exploitation of women at this time."
"Some 100 000 women from conquered countries in the Far East were forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Armed Forces of Japan."
"This sexual slavery, which was in itself totally criminal, had further consequences too."
"These consequences were enforced abortions, mutilations and murders on a large scale, and large-scale instances of suicide among these women."
"Obviously any of these women who are still alive today are very old."
"It must be conceded that during the post-war period the Japanese Government did much to compensate for these dreadful offences against the women who experienced them."
"Today this resolution calls on the Japanese Government to make a final political, moral and financial settlement upon those women who are still alive and with the families of those who have died."
"This is most certainly their due."
"author. - (NL) Madam President, I should like to start by expressing my solidarity with these women - I believe on behalf of all of us."
"I am pleased that this is on the agenda, as it has taken a very long time."
"The European Parliament has been wavering for five months over whether human rights for women should actually be a priority or not."
"Mr Dillen, who has now left, has just said that oppression of women is typical of the Koran - which is complete nonsense, as the matter of 'comfort women' shows that men do not need the Koran to repress and abuse women."
"I am actually also rather disappointed with the attitude in the European Parliament."
"As I have just said, this House wavered over this for a very long time, and I have heard even Members of this Parliament coming up with arguments such as 'Well, yes, but 90% of these women did it of their own free will' and 'Oh well, it is their culture, you have to understand that'."
"To be frank, I find this sickening."
"It is rape, and rape is without exception a crime in all ages and all cultures."
"I now gather that Japanese school textbooks have been adapted; but I then hear from the Japanese embassy that the tale has to be told very cautiously, as pupils do not yet know much about sexuality and could incur psychological damage."
"No-one talks about the psychological damage to the 'comfort women' themselves."
"To be frank, I find that quite shocking."
"Anyway, I am pleased that this is now on our agenda and that we are just about to adopt it."
"I think that it is important that apologies be sincere and unequivocal."
"It is not a matter of a formality."
"With the previous Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, once more casting doubt on the whole issue, it is not sufficient for the current government to then say 'Oh, but we shall continue with the previous policy'."
"Sincere and unequivocal is what is needed."
"Also, when I hear the arguments that have been forthcoming from the Japanese embassy in recent days - incidentally complete with a recognition of everything that has already been done - I think that much progress remains to be made on sincerity."
"I hope, therefore, that this resolution expresses the solidarity of all of us with the victims."
"author. - (DE) Madam President, I am very grateful to the previous speaker for having drawn attention to the fact that no religion on this earth is immune to massive human rights violations against women, but this is more to do with dictatorship and authoritarian systems than with a specific religion."
"Hundreds of thousands of women before and during the Second World War were forced into prostitution by the Japanese Imperial Armed Forces."
"Historians' estimates assume that around 200 000 of these 'comfort women' from Korea, China, Taiwan and the Philippines were handed over to Japanese soldiers as sex slaves."
"The 'comfort women' system is one of the largest cases of human trafficking in the 20th century and led to gang rapes on a massive scale and to forced abortions."
"After the end of the war, many women were murdered by the armed forces or prevented from returning home."
"Many of the survivors remained silent out of shame about their past and were stigmatised and relegated to the fringes of society."
"The issue of forced prostitution was not broached at the war crime trials and there was no talk of reparation."
"Not until the end of the 1980s did the fate of the comfort women come to light again."
"The reason for this was not an automatic change in awareness, but the rapidly growing women's movement in South Korea."
"Little by little, women who had been forced into prostitution spoke out publicly."
"In 1992 weekly demonstrations began in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul with the words: the Japanese Government should be ashamed, not us."
"In 1997 the Japanese Government was asked for the first time to take legal and moral responsibility internationally for the most severe human rights violations committed against women."
"In her report the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women demanded financial compensation for the victims and court sentences for the perpetrators."
"The reaction of the Japanese Government at the time was an out and out rejection of these demands."
"It has already been said several times today that the truth must be taken into account."
"We are therefore asking the Japanese Government publicly to reject any assertions that deny or question the subjugation and enslavement of the comfort women and we are likewise demanding that they accept moral and legal responsibility for the enslavement of 200 000 people."
"We are calling on the Japanese Government to implement mechanisms to provide reparations to all surviving victims and their families as quickly as possible."
"Many victims of the comfort women system have passed away or are at least 80 years old, which means speed is of the essence."
"We are also calling on our colleagues in the Japanese National Assembly, however, to make their contribution in parliament to help get these mechanisms accepted."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, there are pages in the world's history we would wish not to be repeated anywhere, ever."
"One of these pages is the story of 'comfort women'."
"I refer to the officially commissioned acquisition of young women by the Government of Japan, from the 1930s and during the Second World War, for the sole purpose of sexual servitude to the Japanese Imperial Armed Forces."
"We do not know exactly the numbers of women who were enslaved but we know that the 'comfort women system' included gang rape, forced abortions, humiliation and sexual violence, resulting in mutilation, death or eventual suicide, and that it was one of the largest cases of human trafficking in the 20th century, involving not hundreds but thousands of women."
"Today, the remaining survivors are 80 and more years of age and one could argue that the problem is no longer an important issue."
"But I fully understand the wish of these women and their families to clear their names."
"Today we express our solidarity with the women who were victims of this system."
"We call on the Japanese Government to formally acknowledge and accept historical and legal responsibility and to implement effective administrative mechanisms to provide reparations to all surviving victims of the 'comfort women system' and to the families of deceased victims."
"Taking into account the excellent relationship between the European Union and Japan, based on the mutually shared values of the rule of law and respect for human rights, I hope that the Government and the Parliament of Japan will take all necessary measures to recognise the sufferings of sex slaves and to remove existing obstacles to obtaining reparations before Japanese courts and that current and future generations will be educated about these events."
"I am sure that official recognition of the existence of the 'comfort women system' and an apology on behalf of the Japanese Government also would do much to help heal the wounds of our painful common history."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, people can be forgiven for their sins, but people's crimes cannot be forgotten."
"This applies as much to Japan as it did, for example, to Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia."
"The Japanese committed immensely barbaric war atrocities in the 1930s and 1940s."
"To some extent, they paid dearly by having two of their cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, annihilated by the mighty nuclear holocaust brought upon them by the US."
"However, Japan inflicted many dreadful evils on the world in the past, and one of these - the sexual slavery of 'comfort women' - only came to prominence relatively recently."
"Some of these poor and now frail elderly ladies are still with us, as the remnants of a past that is inconvenient for Japan but torturous for them."
"These women are asking for two very simple things from today's rich and powerful Japan: an official apology and very modest humanitarian aid."
"Certainly, the European Parliament, with this joint motion for a resolution, expects and demands that the Japanese Government must do both and fast."
"Otherwise, aside from the stigma of shame, the EU must consider taking particularly effective action against ex-imperial Japan."
"Madam President, the subject of today's debate is a violation of human rights that took place during the 1930s, during the Japanese occupation, when young women in the Imperial Armed Forces were sexually exploited and forced into prostitution, despite the fact that the Japanese Government had signed international conventions on combating traffic in women and children and supported the UN Resolution on Women, Peace and Security."
"The sincere sympathy of the Japanese premier is currently being undermined by Japanese officials in connection with the closure of the Asian Women's Fund programme and mandate in March 2007, out of which only monetary compensation was paid to women."
"In supporting the resolution and the demand for compensation, we would, however, point out that in modern times, too, the boundary between the normal and the pathological is being eroded, and this flies in the face of moral norms, so there is a need for radical moves to combat prostitution as a form of modern-day slavery."
"Prostitutes are not just victims of wars that took place 50 years ago; it could also be women of today who are being exploited, in the Belgian Congo, for example, as reported in the press, and indeed in many other countries, even rich ones."
"In the name of respect for the human being we should also unmask the spread of a hedonistic and commercial culture that is pointing towards abuse in the area of sex, drawing even very young women and girls into the sphere of prostitution and other forms of demoralisation."
"Respect for the identity and dignity of women is not based solely on uncovering crimes or abuses in the sphere of sexual discrimination or other injustices; it is based primarily on the drafting of development programmes and on the real-life practice of principles embracing all areas of a woman's life."
"These principles must be rooted in a new realisation of the worth of a woman as wife, mother, carer or employee, as a human being and a person who is the equal of a man, despite being different."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1993 the Japanese Government spokesman at that time, Yohei Kono, extended Japan's 'sincere apologies and remorse to all those ... who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women'."
"In 1995 the Prime Minister at that time, Mr Murayama, also apologised publicly to the comfort women on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War."
"That same year the Asian Women's Fund was set up to grant reparations and medical aid to survivors on behalf of the Japanese Government and people."
"These attempts to obtain reparations for the comfort women and a renewed public apology from the former Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Koizumi, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in 2005 are positive steps by Japan."
"Japan has thereby recognised its responsibility for these unspeakable human rights violations."
"Only a few days ago, the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed the declaration of the government spokesman, Mr Kono, which I quoted at the beginning, as Japan's official position."
"We now have the moving testimony of survivors, and this moving testimony has again aroused interest in this terrible period, in Europe as well as in the United State, Canada and Australia."
"Our actions here are not simply about the past; they are about drawing the right conclusions from the events and doing everything in our power to combat today's forms of slavery, sexual exploitation and human trafficking."
"With the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, the Commission is actively supporting NGOs throughout the world involved in preventing violence against women and children and combating human trafficking for the purpose of sexual slavery."
"On 23 November 2007 the Commission sent out a further signal on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, by having affirmed its emphatic commitment to combating gender-based violence."
"The European Union is conducting a regular human rights dialogue with Japan, touching on all the EU's concerns - including women's rights."
"Japan is a like-minded global player cooperating constructively with us in multilateral forums in order to improve respect for and protection of human rights."
"Together with the European Union, Japan has therefore issued a resolution on human rights in North Korea and denounced the actions of the regime in Myanmar."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on these three topics will take place at the end of today's sitting."

"Draft general budget for 2008, modified by the Council (all sections) (signature)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the next item is the signature of the Community budget for 2008 and I should like to thank the Council and the Commission sincerely for their effective cooperation."
"Prime Minister, President-in-Office, José Sócrates, Mr Durão Barroso and Mrs Grybauskaitė, please accept our sincere thanks."
"We shall now sign it and I would ask those concerned to approach the table: the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, the rapporteur, the Commissioner and the Presidents, too, if they so wish; they are warmly invited to do so."
"(The budget was signed)"
"Results of the European Council meeting of 13 and 14 December 2007 in Brussels - Report on the six months of the Portuguese Presidency (debate)"
"The next item is the statements from the Council and the Commission on the results of the European Council of 13 and 14 December and the report on the six months of the Portuguese Presidency."
"I should first of all like to thank the Portuguese President sincerely and to recognise how very successful the Portuguese Presidency has been."
"I should also like, even though I cannot name them all, to mention a few representative people: the President-in-Office, Prime Minister José Sócrates, Foreign Minister Luís Amado, Secretary of State Manuel Lobo Antunes and also, of course, Ambassador Álvaro Mendonça e Moura."
"Many thanks to you and all your colleagues who have assisted you."
"My sincere thanks also to the Commission and its President, José Manuel Durão Barroso."
"I should also like to say here once again (I have already said this briefly to the European Council) that the fact that we have been able to reach a result on the important issue of the Galileo Project is also due to the fact that the European Commission and the European Parliament have cooperated so well together and we have in the end been able to achieve a good result together with the Portuguese Presidency."
"Many thanks to the Commission too in this respect."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the past week has been very eventful."
"First of all the signing of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights on Wednesday in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, followed by the signing of the Reform Treaty on Thursday in Lisbon and finally the Summit on Friday in Brussels."
"I must say, President-in-Office, Mr Sócrates, that the ceremonial signing of the Treaty at the Hieronymus Monastery in Lisbon was a very beautiful, symbolic expression of our many common interests."
"We hope that all the parliaments and peoples will now follow Hungary's example and quickly adopt the Treaty as well."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Presidency and I myself have reached the point of reporting on our Presidency to Parliament with the feeling that we have done our duty."
"I think you will agree with me when I say that Europe and the Europeans have good reason to feel satisfied with political developments over the last six months."
"Indeed, I am convinced that Europe today is stronger, more self-assured and more confident."
"At the end of these six months it is a better Europe; better in relation to itself, but also better in relation to the rest of the world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you are well of the three priorities of the Portuguese Presidency."
"The priorities, I would recall, were the Treaty and the EU-Brazil and EU-Africa summits."
"As I had the opportunity to say here in the session launching the Portuguese Presidency, they were always the three main priorities of the Portuguese Presidency, right from the beginning."
"I am very pleased to tell you that we have achieved all the goals we set ourselves for these six months."
"But let us begin with the goal that was the most important of all: the Treaty."
"The Treaty, the new Treaty for Europe."
"This was always the top priority, and the new Treaty that we signed in Lisbon and named the Treaty of Lisbon is, of course, a treaty that resolves Europe's institutional deadlock, a treaty that responds to Europe's institutional crisis."
"I must tell you that no sign of confidence was of greater importance for the European project, for Europeans and for the European economy than overcoming that deadlock and that crisis."
"But this Treaty also responded to the three major challenges facing Europe."
"First, the challenge of European citizenship."
"The challenge of affirming the values underlying our political project and that affirmation of values and of European citizenship is contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights that we proclaimed in this Parliament but which has legal force through its inclusion in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"That was the first challenge."
"The second, of course, was to give Europe better decision-making ability."
"Anyone who is familiar with Europe clearly understands that a Europe of 27 had to change its rules."
"Changing the rules, keeping the rules democratic, but allowing the institutions to respond more effectively and efficiently on behalf of all Europeans to the challenges of the new world."
"This challenge was also addressed by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Finally, the challenge of having stronger and more capable institutions, institutions equal to the new demands that Europe is facing."
"This challenge is also now addressed by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"And if we want to attempt to sum up the Treaty of Lisbon it is precisely here that we should do it."
"It is a treaty that meets the three major challenges: transforming Europe into a political project that affirms its values and affirms European citizenship, a Europe that is now better able to take up the challenges of modern times, that has the conditions for more effective decision-making, and also a Europe that has strengthened its institutions to respond to Europeans' aspirations and also to what the world expects of Europe."
"This is an important treaty for Europe, but it is also a treaty that makes Europe stronger to serve a better world."
"It is not only a treaty for the Europeans, for the European economy, it is also a treaty that gives a clear signal to the world that Europe is back and is back to pursue a European project in a form to inspire many continents all over the world."
"The Treaty: this priority was achieved under the Portuguese Presidency."
"But while the Treaty was perhaps the greatest contribution that we made to a stronger Europe, I would like to emphasise the other two priorities."
"First, the summit with Brazil."
"Why Brazil?"
"For the simple reason that EU external policy already included annual summits with India, Russia and China but has never had an annual summit with Brazil."
"By approving a strategic partnership at that summit we are transforming the EU's external policy into a more coherent and more understandable policy."
"We now have a policy with BRIC - Brazil, Russia, India and China - that serves a Europe that wants to be a global political player."
"This summit with Brazil and the strategic partnership that we established has enhanced Europe's external policy and established better conditions to bolster the European economy, and also to endorse the values and aims of the European project."
"Thirdly the summit with Africa."
"The Africa summit."
"When we embarked on the Africa summit we were well aware of the difficulties we were facing, but we overcame them because it was clear from the start that we were right, that Europe was paying the price of seven years with no political dialogue with Africa, that this was bad for Africa, bad for Europe and bad for the world."
"There was no reason not to have a broader and global political dialogue with Africa."
"And perhaps Portugal's sensitivity made it better placed to appreciate that this was a mistake."
"We corrected this mistake with the Africa summit."
"The summit was a success, because for the first time in the history of the world, Europe has a joint strategy with Africa."
"Let us not deceive ourselves; it is not a European strategy for Africa, or vice versa."
"No, it is a joint strategy of both continents and a joint strategy that is being pursued on the basis of five main themes that are important to both continents: peace and security, climate change, human rights, areas that are - migrations too, excuse me, I was forgetting that area of major importance - those are the five structuring themes of a political dialogue with Africa that, as I said, concerns Africa, Europe and also the world as a whole."
"But we did not restrict ourselves to approving a joint strategy, we also laid down an action plan and a mechanism for implementing the strategy, and we are now setting up an institution between the European Commission and the African Union, the African Union Commission, to enable them to work together to implement what we have agreed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am in no doubt that anyone at all familiar with these issues, anyone interested in human rights, in issues of climate change, of migration and immigrant advocacy, of development or security, will be pleased to see that Europe and Africa have at last set up a political framework for negotiation and dialogue."
"I am in no doubt that Europe's external policy is better and richer since the Africa summit and I am therefore pleased to tell you that over these six months we have succeeded in overcoming obstacles and deadlocks, and that we have also succeeded in overcoming prejudices so that we can claim today, at the end of the Portuguese Presidency, that Europe has become stronger not only internally but also in its external policy."
"We now have a coherent policy in relation to the BRIC countries and a political dialogue with Africa that everyone involved in external relations thought it was a mistake not to have in recent years."
"The Treaty, Brazil and Africa are achievements, and achievements for the benefit of Europe, but I have to say, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, that there is not time here to recount, even in summary, all the achievements of the Portuguese Presidency, but I would like to tell you, albeit briefly, that this Presidency has left its mark on the main items on the European agenda and I would like to begin with the agenda regarding freedoms."
"This Presidency left its mark on the freedom agenda the moment we proclaimed here the Charter of Fundamental Rights and that was a decisive moment for the European project, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as I have said earlier, now has legal force in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It was also under the Portuguese Presidency that we succeeded in establishing the European Day against the Death Penalty and this honours European values and gives a clear signal to the world of Europe's defence of the value of life."
"I would also like you to know that it was during the Portuguese Presidency, at the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, that a moratorium on the death penalty was agreed and that vote came as a result of a European proposal that honours European traditions and values."
"Moreover, I would also like to highlight in this freedom agenda the efforts that the Portuguese Presidency made to extend the area of freedom of movement to the new Member States."
"On 21 and 22 December, with the President of the Commission, and a number of ministers, I will have the opportunity to be present at the borders where controls are to be abolished, with nine countries entering the Schengen area, thereby fulfilling the greatest aspiration of those citizens who want to be part of Europe, to have freedom of movement while at the same time belonging to an area that safeguards their security."
"SISone4all is a nice story, because it was at Portuguese insistence that on 31 December 2007 these internal border controls will be abolished, because it was a Portuguese minister who would not accept the idea that it was technically impossible to connect the databases of the new countries to the databases of the Schengen system, and because it was a Portuguese firm that proposed a technical solution to the problem."
"On 21 and 22 December we will be in those countries telling them that Portugal is very proud to have been able to contribute with Portuguese technology and Portuguese political will to enable those countries to give their citizens full freedom of movement, because that is the highest aspiration of the European peoples."
"I am from a country that experienced that moment;"
"I remember well the moment when border controls between Portugal and Spain were abolished, and indeed for the first time we felt part of the European family."
"It is for that reason that if there is a symbolic moment of this Presidency it will be when the Portuguese and other politicians, and the President of the Commission, are present at those borders to mark the moment when controls are abolished, thereby realising a European dream and aspiration to create that area of freedom of movement and security that the Schengen area represents."
"We did leave our mark on the freedom agenda, but also on the social agenda."
"I would like to remind everyone that it was during the Portuguese Presidency that an agreement was reached between European trade unions and employers' associations, and it is a very important agreement that underlines the challenges for the European labour market, but it was also during this Presidency that all the countries agreed on the common principles of flexicurity, so acting as a driving force, moving ahead with this European model designed to make the flexibility that is indispensable to competitiveness compatible with security for workers, which is peculiar to the European social model."
"Finally on this social agenda, I would like to highlight the attention that we gave to migration policy."
"Over the six months we placed much emphasis on this issue."
"We held an international conference in Lisbon because our goal was and is to help lay down or set out the broad guidelines for a European migration policy."
"At the latest Council, the President of the Commission had the opportunity to present the Commission's document defining the bases of that policy, a migration policy that essentially has three pillars: inclusion of immigrants, combating illegal immigration, and cooperation with countries of origin, so as to regulate migratory flows and thereby protect immigrants."
"That is a landmark, an important item on the European social agenda and Portugal is very proud to have helped make progress on that European migration policy."
"The Portuguese Presidency also made its mark on the economic agenda, by which I mean, as the President of the European Parliament said, our approval under this Portuguese Presidency of the Galileo project, which for many years was dragging its feet, damaging Europe and sending out a clear signal to the whole world that Europe was incapable, in such a decisive sector, of having its own project."
"This Galileo project is perhaps one of the infrastructure projects for raising Europe's profile in the world and endorsing Europe in the highly competitive field of telecommunications."
"That is why we are very proud that it was under the leadership of the Portuguese Presidency and of Minister Mário Lino that agreement was finally reached that distinguishes Europe and the European project."
"Also on the economic agenda, I would like to highlight our contribution to a Europe-wide maritime policy, with the approval of the Framework Directive on the marine environment strategy as a basic condition for Europe to have a consistent approach between all countries in their relationship to the sea."
"As regards energy and climate change, I would like to highlight just two points: the first was the conclusion of the strategic plan for energy technologies."
"That is an absolutely fundamental point marking Europe's ambitions in this area and its will to invest as much as possible in innovation and research so that we can meet the challenges of the future."
"I would also like to point to the Bali agreement, achieved under the Portuguese Presidency, which provides us today with a clear roadmap for negotiations so that in 2009 we can again reach a global agreement to respond to the challenges of climate change."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, we also left a mark on the agenda for the future of the European Union meaning, of course, the Declaration on Globalisation that we approved in the latest Council."
"This declaration means the following: firstly, Europe has solved its institutional problems and is now looking to face the challenges of this changing world to assume a position of leadership in institutional reform, to address education, training and research as a central issue to solve Europe's role in a globalised world, but also to combat all the environmental challenges threatening the world."
"This European globalisation agenda means that Europe is back, and Europe is back to discussing absolutely fundamental issues that it had unfortunately put very much on the back burner because in recent years it was so tied up with its institutional problems."
"A declaration on globalisation, but also an agreement on the Reflection Group."
"At the recent Council we adopted a mandate for this Reflection Group to enable it to contribute to a general reflection on this issue and the future of Europe between 2020 and 2030."
"To enable it to help anticipate and meet the challenges, we also approved the leadership of this group - Felipe González, who is one of the great Europeans in European History, returning to political life to lead a reflection group serving what for him has always been one of his noblest ideals: the European project, together with Vice-Chairs Vike-Freiberga and Jorma Ollila who will join him in leading the group that has been formed in the meantime."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I said, I am not going to describe every detail of the Portuguese Presidency's achievements, but I would like to tell you that I am very proud of this Presidency and very pleased about it."
"We achieved all the goals we set ourselves; the most important ones and even those we doubted we would achieve."
"The Treaty, Brazil, Africa, but also the marks we made in the economic agenda, the social agenda, the freedom agenda and the agenda for the future."
"This Presidency, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is a Presidency of a pro-European country, a country that clearly understands that it is defending its own interests through the European project, in a country committed to European ideals, in a country led by European politicians who clearly understand that what Europe needs is to develop the European project and that this European project is probably the most generous, most critical and most important project of modern times, that this European project is important for Europeans, for the European economy, and also important for the world."
"If you will allow me, Mr President, I would like to finish with some thanks, and with a very personal thank you to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is sitting here beside me, who has accompanied me throughout these six months, to the Secretary of State for European Affairs, who is here with me, but I would also like to thank the Portuguese diplomatic corps, which organised everything, working in the background and often unacknowledged for the fruits of its labours;"
"I want to thank the whole Portuguese diplomatic corps that gave of its best for its country and for Europe and was headed by one of the great Portuguese ambassadors, ambassador Mendonça e Moura, who is here with me."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we began this Presidency with the motto: 'A stronger Europe for a better world' and we have reached the end of these six months convinced that we have honoured that motto, that we gave of our best as a country so that Europe might present itself as a stronger Europe, a Europe that better serves its citizens and a Europe that is better equipped to play its role in the world."
"We did it all for Europe, in the service of Europe, because that is how to defend the interests of Portugal, of Europe and also of the world."
"I would like to thank all the Parliamentary groups that gave us so much support over this period;"
"I would like to thank the Commission for its support and I would like to thank the President of the European Parliament for his constant help that he never refused the Portuguese Presidency."
"I am very proud of and very pleased about the Presidency and so I would like to share my happiness with you which is a happiness for Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Many thanks, President-in-Office, for this speech and once again for your great dedication."
"Commissioner. - (PT) Mr President, President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, over the past six months we have had an excellent illustration of what we have championed as the two ways of making progress in Europe."
"Namely, at the same time as endeavouring to resolve institutional issues, we are endeavouring to make progress in terms of practical results, to demonstrate to our citizens that Europe is truly at the service of their aspirations."
"2007 showed that Europe is capable of taking up these challenges."
"We have just seen the negotiation, agreement and signature of a treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon, that will give Europe the institutions for the future, so that it can respond to the challenges of the 21st century."
"At this point, I would like once again to pay tribute to the Portuguese Presidency and especially to Prime Minister José Sócrates for his competent leadership of the European Union."
"It is also only right to acknowledge the important contribution of the German Presidency and Chancellor Merkel when the mandate was obtained that enabled positive progress to be made on this agreement that is so important for Europe."
"Certainly at the beginning there were many who doubted the need to make this effort, but the truth is that a few days ago, in Lisbon, the 27 EU governments were able to come together on a treaty that they themselves had negotiated."
"That political achievement now has to be put into practice."
"The Member States have agreed on and signed the Treaty and also agreed to ratify it, so that it enters into force on 1 January 2009."
"This undertaking by the Member States must be taken very seriously."
"By signing the Treaty, the governments have taken responsibility to defend the Treaty before their parliaments and public opinion."
"They must be successful in those tasks if Europe is to move forward."
"Mr President, I wish to warmly salute Hungary for the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon yesterday."
"The Treaty was ratified with an overwhelming majority: 385 'yes' votes and only five 'no' votes."
"(Applause)"
"I think it is a very symbolic fact and a very positive political signal that one of the new Member States is the first country to ratify the Lisbon Treaty."
"Hungary deserves our applause."
"At the same time, during this period and specifically in these six months, we have seen the European Union taking a lead on policies that affect every European every day: economic growth and job creation, climate change, energy, migration and innovation."
"These are the issues that will determine the success of Europe now and in the future."
"Prime Minister Sócrates has already spoken about many of the achievements of the Presidency."
"I will not repeat all of them. I could, of course, agree with everything he said: the importance of the European Union-Africa Summit, the first summit with Brazil on the strategic relationship with that very important country, the agreement it was possible to reach on Galileo, and the very important agreement by the social partners on the principles of flexicurity."
"I could also add some other points and underline some that sometimes have deserved less attention but are also important."
"For instance, the general political agreement reached with the European Parliament on the creation of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology - a very concrete project and a real flagship for innovation in Europe - and also the launch of an integrated maritime policy for the Union."
"This brings to fruition extensive work begun by the Commission almost three years ago, in March 2005."
"Following a wide public debate on a Green Paper issued by the Commission in June 2006, we have now reached a clear consensus in the European institutions on how important maritime policy is for the Union to meet the challenges of globalisation and competitiveness, of climate change and energy, and to maximise the potential of our oceans and seas in a sustainable manner."
"Following in the footsteps of the European Parliament's excellent five-committee report of July, the Commission's vision of an integrated maritime policy for the Union and an action plan were fully endorsed by the European Council last week."
"A particular note of appreciation is due to the Portuguese Presidency for making this a priority for the Union."
"How were all these achievements made possible?"
"Central to this has been the effective cooperation between the three core institutions: Parliament, the Commission and the Council of Ministers have been able to work together to develop a real consensus across a wide range of the European Union's work."
"We have also benefited from a growing realisation that the European Union offers the right vehicle to address today's big challenges."
"Just look at the Eurobarometer figures released today."
"These confirm the figures from spring this year that overall support for the European Union is higher than at any time over the past decade."
"We are winning the trust of European citizens; now we must show that we deserve that trust."
"Last week, in a matter of days, we saw the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights by the three institutions in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the signature of the Treaty of Lisbon and, following those very important moments, a European Council focus on key issues of direct interest to citizens."
"After the historic steps of Wednesday and Thursday, on Friday the European Council returned to the crucial task of turning the Europe of results into reality, and we now have a framework in place for the results the European Union should deliver in 2008."
"Critical to our future action is the importance of globalisation."
"It was not so long ago that policy-makers tended to shy away from globalisation."
"Globalisation was seen as being too difficult and too divisive, and sometimes we even wanted to avoid the word."
"The Declaration on Globalisation approved by the European Council has turned this around."
"We know now that Europe can unite around an activist, proactive approach to globalisation."
"Not all the impact of globalisation is positive - we know that - but that is no reason for passivity."
"It should rather redouble our efforts to make the most of the opportunities for Europe offered by globalisation."
"The European Union has every reason to feel confident about its future in the age of globalisation."
"It is showing how the values which govern European society are fully compatible with the proactive approach to globalisation."
"That is the message to come out of the Declaration on Globalisation."
"There is now a real sense of momentum in our agenda for succeeding in the age of globalisation, a momentum we will keep up by a series of Commission initiatives in the coming months."
"I was pleased that the Portuguese Presidency decided to devote particular attention to migration."
"If we manage the issue of migration well, everyone can benefit: Europe, the European Union Member States, but also the countries of origin and the migrants themselves, because, as the President-in-Office of the Council has just reminded us, this is also a social issue."
"The European Council backed the integrated approach proposed by the Commission early this December."
"To back up the proposals we already have on the table, such as illegal migration, undeclared work and the blue card for highly-skilled workers, we will come forward with new proposals next year to build a truly comprehensive approach at European level regarding migration."
"Before this, we will come forward with our package of measures to realise the Union's promises on climate change and energy."
"This is another point about globalisation: climate change and the need to have a global solution to a global problem."
"I am happy to say to you that Europe is really leading this issue worldwide."
"I am proud that the European Union and our 27 Member States spoke with one voice at the Bali Conference."
"The declaration is an important step in the right direction on the road to Copenhagen in 2009."
"I know that some of us would have wished for more - I personally would have preferred more - but the fact that there was a consensus at a United Nations Conference and a commitment to a target date and a post-2012 regime was in itself a success and, let us be frank, that success would not have been possible without European leadership and European unity."
"The focus is now on the need to ensure the follow-up and insist on ambitious, binding targets for the reduction of CO2."
"Just a few days after Bali, there is a palpable sense that the wind of change is blowing in our direction."
"Some of our main partners who have not yet changed their minds - Australia already has - will change their minds."
"But we need to keep up the pressure to give meaning to our leadership."
"The best way to do this is to show we mean business by driving on with our own proposals."
"I want to work closely with this Parliament over the next year and agree a common goal of a political agreement on the full package by the end of next year."
"The European Council also took the opportunity to look further ahead, not only in terms of a declaration on globalisation but to come up with some ideas."
"The reflection group is an innovative approach, one which can pay off."
"Looking ahead to 2020, 2030 requires discipline and imagination, but the result can help us to keep the focus on the big picture, in particular on the global challenges."
"The group can count on the support of the Commission when the full team starts its work later next year."
"I also welcome the choice of Felipe Gonzáles, a very experienced statesman and a committed European, as Chairman of the Group, and the two Vice-Chairs, Mrs Vike-Freiberga and Mr Jorma Ollila."
"The European Council also looked at more immediate challenges."
"The stability of Kosovo is heavily dependent on a united European Union, and a solution for Serbia and Kosovo lies in Europe."
"They know that and we know that."
"We must carry this through into determined and united European Union action."
"This is a stern test for Europe, one that we cannot afford to fail."
"The European Commission encourages the Member States to keep a united and coherent approach regarding the Kosovo issue."
"Before I finish, let me say that the Commission is extremely satisfied that European consensus on humanitarian aid has been adopted by Parliament and the Council."
"The declaration that I have the honour of signing after this sitting with President Pöttering and Prime Minister Sócrates is a wide-ranging policy statement about our objectives, principles and good practice approaches to humanitarian aid, delivered both bilaterally by Member States and by the European Community."
"The consensus is a milepost for European Union humanitarian aid."
"The European Commission alone is the second largest humanitarian donor in the world and, by driving forward this consensus, has responded strongly to the increasingly challenging environment facing humanitarians."
"The raising of the Commission policy voice in this area, in the light of its considerable experience in the provision of humanitarian aid and its unique role at the heart of the European Union, is positively welcomed by the Member States, Parliament and also humanitarian partners."
"Internal work has now been launched to translate the commitments contained in the consensus into a draft action plan that should be presented in the first semester of 2008."
"Finally, as President-in-Office of the European Council, Prime Minister Socrates has just said, this year's work is not yet over."
"I will have the honour before the end of the year to join him in very symbolic acts of opening our internal borders."
"As of 21 December 2007, we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders."
"This is a unique and historic accomplishment."
"Estonia, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia will lift internal border controls."
"This will make travelling for all Europeans quicker and easier."
"From 21 December 2007 travel will be possible from the Iberian Peninsula to Poland, from Greece to Finland without border checks."
"I also congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on its strategic leadership for the successful implementation of the Schengen Information System project: the 'SIS One For All'."
"The lifting of the European Union's internal borders brings opportunities for people living, circulating and doing business in Europe."
"It is important to explain to our citizens that, at the same time as we are lifting border controls and promoting freedom, security standards are also being reinforced, because this also means efficient checks at external borders."
"We should not forget that now, for example, the Spanish border is the Polish border and the Polish border is also the Greek border, so we can do this without a reinforcement of our security at the external borders and we are moving ahead only because those Member States have made the effort required."
"So I believe that - not only from a symbolic point of view - this will be a very important development of our new, enlarged, committed Europe."
"The overall message from 2007 is one of great hope, and no little expectation."
"The eyes of Europeans are turning to the European Union for the answers to so many questions."
"The past few months can give us confidence that we are up to the task."
"(Applause)"
"Commission President, many thanks for your speech and your dedication."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today this Parliament celebrates a fully functioning Europe."
"The Treaty of Lisbon is signed."
"Its ratification has begun."
"I congratulate Hungary, the first of our Member States to have ratified it."
"With the Treaty of Lisbon, our shared values - democracy, freedom, solidarity - and our objectives - peace, security, environmental protection and prosperity - reaffirm our common destiny."
"Yes, the Treaty of Lisbon gives our Union greater cohesion."
"The integration process we began 50 years ago is still ongoing: we are still united in diversity!"
"It is this diversity of origin, culture and language that makes Europe truly rich and that is established in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It is from inclusion that pluralist Europe draws its strength."
"We, the law-makers, have a duty of explanation towards our fellow citizens."
"Let us make it as simple as possible."
"The European Union and the Member States are united."
"They share their competences."
"They have decided to exercise part of their sovereignty jointly."
"Let us ask of Europe the things in which it has competence and let us ask of the Member States the things in which they have competence."
"My group will continue to campaign for the Treaty of Lisbon and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which puts the seal on our shared values."
"Let us hope that this is explained, understood and above all respected by everyone, and that this Treaty also gains the support of the greatest number of our fellow citizens."
"From 2009, the new institutional framework provided by the Treaty of Lisbon will increase this Parliament's powers."
"It is important to know that from June 2009 the results of the European elections will determine this Parliament's composition and will affect the appointment of the President of the Commission."
"Obviously my group hopes to convince as many of our fellow European citizens as possible to vote for EPP-ED leadership, a leadership capable of pursuing a socioeconomic strategy to deal with globalisation and an ageing population, a leadership capable of investing in research and development, of developing a European area of justice and security to fight crime, illegal immigration and terrorism more effectively, a leadership capable of making the right choices for the protection of our environment, sustainable development and our energy independence, a leadership capable of conducting a foreign policy that enables Europe to speak with one voice."
"That, for us, is the basis of the competences of a united Europe and of future governance, European governance."
"That is what is needed in Kosovo today to keep the peace."
"Peace and stability in the Balkans, at the gates of the EU, is very much a matter for Europeans."
"Good governance of Europe also has a medium- and long-term vision, however, and we support the European Council's decision to set up a Reflection Group to measure the future impact of decisions taken today, here, at the heart of our democracy, which will seek solutions to the challenges that a united Europe will have to face in the next 10, 20 or 30 years, which will reflect on EU development strategies."
"Only strong governance can dispel the reluctance and opposition to the fight against climate change."
"The assessment of Bali is a striking example."
"Europe needs a leadership role in order to tackle climate issues, first in Poznan in 2008, where the next negotiations on the climate will take place, then in Copenhagen in 2009."
"We European politicians have a major responsibility there."
"Mortgaging our children's and grandchildren's future would be a crime."
"It is up to us to convince our American partners of this."
"Climate and good governance in Europe are also matters to be dealt with today, here in Brussels, as the Ministers of Agriculture and Fisheries meet for their annual marathon of discussions on production quotas."
"Let us not forget the impact of climate change on food production."
"We have already experienced large increases in the price of food products, last August."
"Yet another has occurred, with wheat and rice reaching record prices."
"Once again, European citizens are waiting for answers from Europe, as well as concerted, coordinated action."
"Mr President, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, we have built 50 years of peace, we have managed to create a single market, we have abolished internal borders, we have a Central Bank and a European currency, since Amsterdam we have been working on a common foreign policy, and we have Europol and Eurojust."
"We are creating an area of security and justice by enlarging and expanding the Schengen area."
"Europe's demand is greater."
"The Treaty of Lisbon is bringing the EU out of its downward spiral."
"For me and my group, the construction of Europe in the 21st century is once again becoming synonymous with enthusiasm and ambition."
"From a free trade area to a true political Europe, we are starting to talk about the European project again and are ready to make choices."
"In this new globalised world, there is no place for 'everyone for himself'."
"Our Member States, however large or densely populated they may be, have no chance of prosperity without integration."
"Thank you to the President, thank you to the President-in-Office of the Council, thank you to the President of the Commission, season's greetings to us all and above all our best wishes for the adoption of the Treaty in 2008 by the other 26 countries."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Presidency has been a success and I congratulate you, Mr Sócrates, and your entire government, on this success."
"The Lobo Antunes family has given us not only a good Secretary of State, but also a distinguished writer who has written an interesting novel entitled The Splendour of Portugal, a line from the national anthem."
"Portugal's reputation has grown with this Presidency, specifically thanks to three things, which you yourself have mentioned."
"Yes, indeed, in relation to Europe the Africa Summit has given back to Africa part of that dignity of which we Europeans have deprived Africans for a long time."
"This has been one of the successes of your Presidency."
"The fact that you have organised a summit with Brazil shows that policy on Latin America has to be given greater attention in European policy because it is in fact based on common traditions (Portugal, Brazil, Spain, South America, Central America), but also today specifically on common values as well, which we share above all with a region of the world - Latin America."
"Organising this summit with Brazil was therefore the right step."
"While we are on the subject of common values, I would like to thank you especially, on behalf of my Group, for focusing your activities on the battle to abolish the death penalty and for creating a European Day against the Death Penalty, one of the glories of the Portuguese Council Presidency."
"(Applause)"
"However, we also have challenges ahead of us."
"The Treaty has been solemnly signed, but I have already experienced the solemn signing of a treaty and I have seen all those who solemnly signed it."
"I have also seen the undergrowth into which they subsequently disappeared, those solemn signatories!"
"Some are no longer in office and this may also be a good thing."
"Now that this Treaty is being ratified, there is something to fight for."
"We have already expressed our thanks to Hungary."
"But if we want to be successful in 2008, we also have to look at precisely what is contained in the conclusions of the Council session held after the ceremonial signing."
"On behalf of my Group, I welcome the fact that the Council acknowledges that the guidelines on an integrated economic policy must be revised."
"I hope the Commission takes this seriously and provides an appropriate statement."
"I also welcome the fact that the Council is asking for a Commission statement on services of general interest, which is also one of our Group's demands."
"I have written to all the Heads of Government on this."
"I hope that you, Commission President, will now finally take this seriously, because you said only a few weeks ago that we did not need a statement of this kind."
"The Council disagrees with you here and, as Socialists, we are on the Council's side."
"You have said, Commission President - and that is why I am appealing to you now - that our work is not yet over."
"You referred here to Schengen."
"Together with Mr Sócrates you are going to open the borders."
"That is fantastic."
"But I know you will still have your work cut out tomorrow."
"The Commission wants to conclude the draft Directive on cross-border health services tomorrow."
"I do not know whether it makes sense for a decision like this to be made quickly at the Commission with one day to go before Christmas or before the Christmas holidays."
"Bolkestein was also decided quickly one day before the summer break and subsequently cost us the ratification of the Constitution."
"I would therefore say to you: if you adopt it tomorrow, please be aware that everything outside the framework of the Services Directive, i.e. outside the country of origin principle, is subject to the following interpretation: we have set a clear framework in the context of the Services Directive."
"If we try to force the country of origin principle through the back door again with specific directives, we will be up against the opposition of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"Bear this in mind for the resolution tomorrow!"
"We need ratification to be successful in 2008."
"Europe's citizens have seen that the Portuguese Council Presidency - together with the German Presidency, too, I happily acknowledge - has led this Union out of stagnation in 2007."
"We have begun to move, we now have a new basis for the Treaty, but one which is not yet in force."
"If we want it to come into force, then we need the trust of the people."
"If we want to gain this trust, however, we have to say to the people: 'Europe is organised on the basis of social responsibility'."
"The 'Chicago Boys' in your Commission cannot come riding up again behind Father Christmas!"
"What we do need in Europe is a clear commitment from the Commission as well that Europe is socially responsible."
"Otherwise it will fail."
"With that I wish you all a Happy Christmas!"
"(Laughter and applause)"
"o"
"o o o"
"There has been some talk about the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency to abolish the death penalty and achieve a moratorium."
"You will certainly all have noticed that the US State of New Jersey has abolished the death penalty."
"I have written to the Governor of New Jersey, Jon Corzine, today and congratulated him and the Legislature on this decision."
"(Applause)"
"o"
"o o o"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it is often said that the exception proves the rule and this Presidency proved no exception!"
"Too often we are proffered fine words and vaulting ambitions from Presidency programmes honoured more in the breach than the observance."
"But, by resurrecting a Treaty that we all thought dead and buried, you have showed the improbable is indeed possible."
"From here on in, Lisbon will be etched on our memories as the moment Europe gave itself the tools and tenacity to make globalisation work for us, not against us."
"Politics would not be politics if we let major successes obscure minor failures."
"While the Lisbon Treaty is an undisputed success, one should beware of hubris."
"The Lisbon Summit, while symbolically important, may have pushed Europe and Africa further apart."
"Consensus on EPAs is receding as swiftly as EU assurances to put trade at the service of development."
"What happened to the great debate on flexicurity?"
"Your big idea for revitalising Europe's economy, which fizzled out before we failed even to define it?"
"Where is the blue card for migration?"
"Or greater labour mobility within the Union?"
"Or linking the Lisbon and Gothenburg Agendas through full unbundling and cuts in CO2?"
"You say you have left your mark on justice and home affairs, but watch out."
"Data-sharing arrangements are dangerously ahead of arrangements for data protection and data security."
"On the positive side of the ledger: European leadership in Bali, an excellent agreement on next year's EU budget, the constructive abstentions you engineered to give us a common policy on Kosovo are tribute to the skills of your ministers."
"And, thanks to your courage and determination, Prime Minister, Europe's bigger Member States can only retard rapid progress for so long."
"For, come 2009, when qualified majority voting is in place, when Parliament holds power of codecision and vetoes can no longer hold Europe hostage, the progressive majority, the centrist majority will succeed in making Europe's choices black and white, unblemished by any blotch of brown."
"Europe may have lost Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy', but you have understood well what Shakespeare called the 'the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world'."
"And, as befits the leader of a great seafaring nation, you have caught it on the ebb."
"(Applauses)"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would like - I do not think any of my colleagues have done it officially - to congratulate the Portuguese Prime Minister, Mr Sócrates, on a very successful Council and, most importantly, on getting the signing of the Lisbon Treaty."
"The point you rightly raise yourself with regard to the issues of how Europe can move forward and face the challenges that are before us is one that has been hindered or retarded because of the lack of efficient decision-making within the Union institutions."
"And, whilst some in this House might not agree with the final agreement in the Lisbon Treaty and others feel that it went too far, the reality was that the existing Treaties did not equip us well for dealing with those problems."
"And, if anything, the Conference at Bali proved how important it was that Europe can speak with a single voice on those areas where the European Union has the powers to make those decisions and the ability to act on the global stage."
"Obviously, what took place in the Council afterwards is slightly different."
"And that sets out more guidelines and the way forward that we want to see happening."
"I should just like to revert back very briefly to what I consider to be the single greatest achievement of the Portuguese Presidency and that is your perseverance with the Africa Summit."
"Because, no matter what anybody else says, our nearest neighbour in development terms, in humanitarian aid terms and in risk terms is the African continent and for too long too many Member States, too many prime ministers of Member States have been standing on their high horse showing high indignation because one particular person in Africa was wrongfully abusing people's human rights and freedoms."
"But then we condemned all of Africa through a failure on our part in Europe to help them to build joint and common strategies with regard to how we process development and allow Africa not just to grow economically or in trade terms but to allow them to take leadership roles to help those countries in Africa that have been successful and to give guidance and direction to other countries that need to be brought forward."
"In a lot of ways this is mirroring what the European Union did at its very early stages, when the vision of the founding fathers of the European Union came together after the horrors of the First and Second World Wars."
"Through their vision they tried to encourage other countries to come forward until such time as we see now: former dictatorships, former totalitarian regimes are now part of the body of democratic families within the European Union."
"Prime Minister, I congratulate you and all of your ministerial team, but in particular all of your civil servants, because they are the people that do all the background work and create the opportunities for us to shine and to rise."
"Finally, if I could thank the Commission as well, because they have had a great role to play with ironing out some of the creases and the difficulties that have been faced in this whole process."
"I wish you all success for the ratification process."
"In my country, Ireland, we have a referendum when people will have an opportunity to vote, but I congratulate the Hungarian Parliament for their decision today on the ratification process."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the Portuguese Presidency for its honest and openly pro-European effort over these six months, and I also think that probably not all but some of the deficiencies that were also pointed out by Mr Watson are more the responsibility of the team than of the Presidency in that, since you cannot get blood out of a stone with the Council we have, it is rather difficult to achieve much more important results."
"I wanted, very briefly, to mention the three priorities of the Presidency and then make a quick comment on the subject of climate change as part of environmental issues."
"On the subject of the Treaty of Lisbon, I believe - as you know, Mr President - that our group has always thought that had we taken a less defensive attitude, it would not have been left solely to the anti-Europeans to define the agenda."
"I think that what Prime Minister Gordon Brown did was a scandal, and the way he treated all of you and also all of us I think was equally scandalous."
"I think that we should no longer extend patience towards them and I also think that the way the United Kingdom, but also the other Member States, have got practically everything they wanted in relation to the Treaty of Lisbon, which represents a step backwards with respect to the Constitution or the Constitutional Treaty, should be something that should really make us reflect on the future of Europe."
"From this point of view, the mandate of the Reflection Group is no big deal, it seems to me, let us be serious!"
"Because it cannot do this, it cannot do that and it cannot do the other!"
"I say this because my group agrees with Spinelli, the only wise man, the only sage of the European institution and the European Parliament; it also suits me that this group of wise men cannot do much, though I do not really know what the Chairman, Felipe González, can do with his mandate, but we will obviously read his work with great interest."
"On the question of Brazil, our basic puzzlement lies in the fact that nobody is focusing any more - or nobody is appearing to focus any more - on the regional dimension of our strategic relations with this part of the world and exactly the same could be said about Africa."
"I would like to know - you said you did not have time to say - but what is the strategic content of this partnership with Brazil really, in concrete terms?"
"Frankly, it seems to me and to my group that the only thing to emerge clearly is that the European Union's interest in Latin America, and in Brazil in particular, is the interest of its businesses, some more than others."
"Yet we wanted a clear strategy towards Latin America aimed at reviving the dimension of regional integration and defining a policy focused on greater collaboration on climate change, that did not simply turn out to be relatively empty support for President Lula's marketing of bioethanol."
"As regards Africa, I must say that my group has always been very critical of an approach, of a policy that is stubbornly ideological, as it has been particularly on the part of the Commission, regarding the economic partnership agreements."
"This à la carte approach concerns us, in that since the African dimension is failing, as our partners have said very clearly, an attempt is being made to reach a bilateral agreement with each of the African countries individually."
"This puts me in mind of what the United States did with the International Criminal Court: it is negative and wholly goes against our values as regards development policy."
"The economic partnership agreements are not an instrument of development policy, and I believe our African partners have told us this loud and clear."
"Finally, Mr President, I wanted to thank the Presidency, but also the Commission, for the work done in Bali, but I think that the hardest part will come now, with the translation of all the commitments we made on climate change into laws and regulations."
"It is great to go and put on a good show and really stand firm in Bali, but then we also need to stand firm within the European Union with clear laws and regulations on this."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, we have just heard much self-congratulation."
"I think, however, that the end of an EU Council Presidency should logically also be a chance for the Heads of State or Government to make a critical assessment of their action in view of the challenges to be faced."
"A check-up of this kind is particularly important at a time when a financial crisis is flaring up, when mobilisation against global warming is causing a struggle, the outcome of which is uncertain, and when the international community is attempting to revive a peace process aimed at resolving the conflict that most epitomises our era."
"Let us start with the financial crisis."
"For once we are hearing the truth from a leader writer at the Financial Times, Martin Wolf."
"'What is happening ... is a huge blow to the credibility of the Anglo-Saxon model of ... financial capitalism', he writes."
"When will the European Council have such a burst of lucidity?"
"More generally, is this really the moment to be pushing free competition to the detriment of employment safeguards and trade union rights, as two alarming judgments by the Court of Justice - the Viking Line case and, more scandalously still, the Vaxholm case - have just illustrated?"
"Is it by going into a downward spiral on employment rights that the EU plans to deal with the challenge of globalisation?"
"Do you believe that Europeans will, in the long term, accept this unravelling of what they have gained, in the name of the free market and the holy grail of competition?"
"You are too easily reassured, Mr Barroso."
"One opinion poll does not announce confidence any more than one swallow makes a summer."
"Next, the climate."
"Europe claims to be at the forefront of this battle, and in fact the targets set by the 27 Member States for reducing emissions are on the right lines."
"But what happens to concrete measures, the moment the industrial lobbies get to work on the decision-making of the EU's highest authorities?"
"We will have a clearer idea tomorrow, when the Commission presents its new standards for carbon dioxide emissions for cars."
"Finally, assistance to Palestine."
"Well done for the financial commitment - provided that it is adhered to, of course."
"But where is the EU's political commitment?"
"What about the clear need for the removal of 550 military roadblocks, for the end of the blockade of Gaza, for the effective freeze on settlement in the West Bank, for the release of prisoners, for an end to the humiliation?"
"When will we see an end to the self-censorship with regard to the occupier, to use the terms of the report by Mr de Soto, the former UN representative in the Middle East?"
"These are three areas, among others, in which the credibility of the European project could be won or lost."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, can I say how much I enjoyed watching you signing the 2008 budget for the European Union earlier this afternoon and - who knows? - perhaps this year the auditors might sign the accounts as well."
"That would be rather fun would it not?"
"Mr Sócrates, I have no doubt you are delighted with your Presidency and the fact that last Thursday you got this Treaty signed in that magnificent monastery in Lisbon."
"But I cannot join in the congratulations of the other Group leaders because to me this simply is not straight dealing."
"Because what was signed at Lisbon was a constitutional treaty."
"It is identical in content to the Constitution that was kicked into touch by the French and by the Dutch."
"All you have done is you have dropped the 'c' word for fear that will cause offence, you have renumbered the articles and you have given us a treaty."
"Frankly, what you have been engaged upon is nothing better than a giant deceit."
"A deliberate attempt to force the Constitution upon the peoples of Europe but without having the courage to call it that."
"It is dishonest; it is designed purely to stop there being referendums in Member State countries."
"And, behind all of this, is this new and I think extremely dangerous form of Euronationalism, the desire to create this state."
"And it does not take 'no' for an answer, and it is not prepared to stop at anything."
"You only have to see in this Chamber when the anthem - the anthem which is not even supposed to be in the new Treaty - is played and you see people standing here, ramrod straight."
"The European project is about nationalism."
"To impose upon people a new nationality, a new legal order without first seeking their consent is a damn dangerous thing to do."
"So please finish your Presidency well."
"Keep your promise to your people in Portugal."
"Give the people in Portugal a referendum."
"That will encourage the other Member States to do the same."
"Frankly, if this Treaty is as good as you say it is, then go out there and sell it to the peoples of Europe."
"(Applause from the Independence/Democracy Group)"
"- (PL) Mr President, on 13 December the leaders of the EU Member States signed the Reform Treaty in Lisbon, i.e. the renamed, late lamented European Constitution."
"Sadly the signatories did not know what they were signing; they did not know because a consolidated version of it does not exist."
"Every so often the Treaty makes reference to some other document, and that leads on to more references."
"It is deliberately this complicated so that no-one can get their head around what it contains."
"To conclude, there are 25 pages of explanations, with three columns linking the article numbering of the old treaty to the provisional numbering of the Treaty of Lisbon, and to the numbering that will apply after the consolidated version is completed - total chaos."
"Portugal, are you not ashamed that such a half-baked document bears the name 'Treaty of Lisbon'?"
"Portugal, are you not ashamed to have to accept the humiliation of the timetable imposed under the German Presidency as part of standardisation?"
"Portugal, are you not ashamed of cheating Europeans by presenting something for their acceptance that they do not want; something they would certainly reject in the event of a referendum, and something they have rejected once already?"
"Shame on you, Portugal!"
"(PT) Mr President, President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations, this has been an excellent Presidency."
"Commission President, congratulations for your support and commitment."
"Interinstitutional cooperation worked and produced good results."
"I also have to say that I did not grasp the meaning of Mr Schulz's speech and I did not understand the reference to the Bolkestein Directive that President Barroso inherited from the previous Commission."
"In this Parliament, we have seen excellent cooperation between the President of the European Commission and the Commission itself with Parliament; all the MEPs worked together well - the Portuguese Members can attest to that - and the PSD members are proud of having contributed to the success of this Presidency."
"Moreover, Portugal has always given of its best when it has had the Presidency of the Council."
"That was the case in 1992 with Mr Cavaco Silva and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, João de Deus Pinheiro; it was the case in 2000, with Prime Minister António Guterres; and it has been the case in 2007, for our third Presidency of the Council, with José Sócrates and Minister Luís Amado."
"I would like to highlight a symbolic measure that President Sócrates mentioned earlier: the Council's recent approval of the European Day against the Death Penalty."
"This is the Europe that we can be proud of, the Europe of common values, finally shared by all Member States without exception."
"I would also like to recall three structural measures that were taken in the course of these six months that I believe were the most important: the end of the institutional crisis, with the adoption of the Treaty and the proclamation of the binding European Charter of Fundamental Rights, the historic extension of the Schengen area, an issue which, as you know, I followed personally, taking in a further nine Member States and nearly four million square kilometres, which could be achieved this year only with Portuguese skill in finding a solution, and the adoption of the important strategic Galileo programme which some would prefer not to exist, leaving the United States, Russia and China with a monopoly."
"Congratulations, Prime Minister Sócrates, and a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year."
"The European Presidency was a Presidency with results, but 2008 will be a quite different year - the sceptic in me would be surprised if the Portuguese do not demand results in national politics too."
"I am among those who believe that he is a better President of the Council than Prime Minister of Portugal."
"(PT) Mr President, how was it possible to do so much in so little time?"
"This question by an MEP sums up well the general opinion on the Portuguese Presidency of the EU: a success."
"In response to Mr Carlos Coelho, allow me to say that I wonder how it was possible to achieve the results that everyone can see and acknowledge as EU President while, at the same time, in Portugal he achieved what he did; he almost seems to have the gift of omnipresence."
"Also, if there is one thing the Portuguese Prime Minister cannot be accused of, it is of not having done his duty in both jobs and of not being where he should have been or needed to be."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have very little time to say much that I would like to say; two minutes are not very long."
"But they are long enough to thank, congratulate and acknowledge many people's contributions, but also to draw attention to the fact that some doubted, some did not believe."
"Fortunately, however, there were those who did believe and people with the fibre of José Sócrates, Prime Minister of Portugal, will go down in history for their determination, precisely because they did believe, they believed and made it happen, which is why we have the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I do not mean to steal anyone else's thunder, as others deserve credit too, but were it not for his and our determination we would not today have the Treaty of Lisbon, were it not for his and our determination we would not have had the Brazil summit, nor the Africa summit."
"These are just three examples out of the many others I could mention."
"Moreover, times have changed, wills have changed, the Polish Government has changed and now we can even celebrate a European Day against the Death Penalty."
"Therefore we should be pleased, congratulate ourselves and above all thank the President of the Council and his whole team, the Portuguese diplomatic corps, the Foreign Affairs Minister, the Secretary of State and the whole Government, and also the President of the European Commission and the Commission itself for their contribution, because it has been a great Presidency and I am very proud of that. Thank you."
"Mr President, the negotiations in Bali on climate change were a success, but we have to think further."
"It was a successful first step on the road to Copenhagen."
"The participants from the European Union's different branches did a very good job and the Portuguese Presidency held it together in a very good way."
"But I would like to focus on the question marks and the problems we face, and this mainly concerns a couple of topics."
"Firstly, the roadmap."
"We have to keep track of every meeting on the road to Copenhagen."
"We have to do it in cooperation and fully realising the measures or the tools of the new Treaty, and do it because there will be codecision on these issues in the future."
"That means other working methods and more cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, and I look forward to this."
"Let me now turn to the problems."
"We have to engage with the G77 Group on forestry, the combination of technology transfer and the fight against poverty and climate change."
"This could be better prepared than in Bali, and it is absolutely necessary to do this."
"I have here in my hands the full Commission Lisbon Strategic Package."
"It is not only the Lisbon Treaty but also the Lisbon Process that we have to merge together and with the work of climate change."
"I think there is still much to prove if we are to talk the talk and walk the walk and fulfil the promises Europe made in Bali."
"- (LV) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on its achievements."
"The Presidency has successfully managed to crown its full agenda with a new treaty."
"This was a period during which agreement needed to be reached on the Reform Treaty, not only in order to increase institutional capacity, but first and foremost to ensure that the Member States retained faith in their ability to agree."
"The Portuguese Presidency has set a standard that can serve as a good reference point for future presidencies, and we need to continue on this note."
"The Treaty of Lisbon must develop its appeal, particularly since it will not be put to a referendum in the countries that rejected the earlier version."
"We need to show European citizens and the rest of the world that Europe has really become dynamic and has achieved technical agreement, and that the European Union is not only an economic project, but also involves collaboration aimed at achieving social objectives."
"The European Union will be able to demonstrate the benefits of the Treaty of Lisbon if it can agree on rapid, far-reaching economic reforms."
"EU policies provide many solutions that are respected globally, such as decisions by the European Competition Network or actions to reduce climate change."
"There are, however, quite a few areas where the European Union has for a long time been indecisive."
"For instance, it was unable to agree on a common policy on security of energy supply and the liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets, which in a variety of ways will determine the European Union's competitiveness on a global scale in a variety of ways."
"The European Union's ability to introduce internal reforms will determine its ability to act externally."
"Dynamism within the European Union will increasingly determine its international status, its attractiveness in the eyes of potential Member States and also its absorption capacity."
"The adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon should mark a dividing line to dispel arguments about the European Union's ability to absorb countries that convincingly meet the accession criteria, and I hope that Ukraine will soon be given an opportunity to demonstrate its wish to join the European Union. Thank you."
"Mr President, 2008 is set to be a decisive year for us in the European Union and, indeed, the Lisbon Treaty will potentially shape the Union's future irrevocably."
"Proponents of the Treaty here today state that its primary purpose is to streamline decision-making powers."
"That is not true."
"This in fact is again an ambitious political strategy to move decision-making in critical areas away from Member States to the institutions of the EU, institutions that remain beyond the democratic reach of citizens."
"Provisions relating to national parliaments, citizens' petitions and subsidiarity are merely tokenistic."
"In Ireland, we will have an opportunity to vote on this Treaty, and I am sure our Taoiseach must envy French and Dutch leaders who can ignore the views of their citizens or other leaders who are not obliged to put the Treaty to their people."
"In Ireland our government pretends that our reputation as good Europeans requires acceptance of this Treaty."
"In fact the values of democracy, of social inclusion, of building peace, to which the EU is rhetorically committed, are best protected by good Europeans rejecting this bad Treaty."
"Irish people do not need the great and good of Europe telling us there is no alternative to Lisbon."
"I should like to say to those EU leaders who have taken an interest in our country: if you are so keen to be involved in a referendum campaign, organise one in your own country."
"If not, then let us get on with our debate and take our democratic decision."
"Mr. President, I gave my apologies in writing for the events last Wednesday when I became aware that a member of my Group had pushed an usher."
"The ushers behave very calmly and professionally and deserve our respect."
"A peaceful visible demonstration ran out of control."
"I am very sorry for that because the Lisbon Treaty deserves visible protest."
"Prime ministers have cancelled the results of two referendums."
"If it had been in Venezuela every one of us would have protested."
"Now, all the prime ministers applauded their Danish colleague when he told the Summit how he had cheated the Danes on a referendum."
"The new Treaty was negotiated behind the most closed doors I have observed in my 29 years in this Parliament."
"One fourth of the members of this House were excluded from influence and knowledge on the re-mix of the Constitution articles into the Lisbon Treaty."
"Prime ministers signed a treaty none of them had read in its final renumbered edition, and Hungary has now ratified something they also have not read."
"The Council was asked to cheat the public by hiding and renumbering and changing the line spacing so a bigger treaty could be presented like a mini-treaty."
"This behaviour deserves democratic protest."
"- (DE) Mr President, there is no question that you have securely moored a lurching ship to the Tejo Quay here."
"The issue is simply: what is on the ship?"
"Has what the former German President Roman Herzog observed so critically about the Constitution now been cleared up?"
"Does it not come ashore any more, is it no longer on the ship of the Reform Treaty?"
"Or are you simply pushing it aside?"
"You say that we have the capacity to act."
"There is something in that."
"It is just that this is still not a democratic value."
"Even dictatorships are proud when they are able to demonstrate the capacity to act."
"And what about the matter of justice - where is the progress there?"
"I think there would be a way out of this bureaucratic impasse and the waste into which you have manoeuvred yourselves here."
"This would be the referendums."
"It is a shame that you are avoiding these if you are so convinced that you have moored the right ship to the Tejo Quay."
"Mr President, may I compliment the Prime Minister for his statement today and on his time as President-in-Office of the Council."
"I am pleased that the European Council remains committed to action on climate change."
"I welcome also the commitment to addressing the remaining barriers to completing the single market, although I am concerned that the Lisbon Strategy emphasis seems to be moving away from the need for economic reform towards the so-called 'social model'."
"I suspect the Lisbon meeting was a gathering that the British Prime Minister will not look back on with pride."
"He signed up to a Treaty on which he promised the British people a referendum."
"He has now reneged on that pledge."
"I believe the Treaty fails to address the fundamental issues of transparency and accountability - bringing Europe closer to the people - that the Laeken Declaration made a priority."
"Mr Brown's behaviour in Lisbon was both extraordinary and maladroit."
"By signing the Treaty at all, he upset the majority of the British people; by snubbing the formal ceremony, he insulted his fellow heads of government."
"Even by his standards, this was breathtaking political miscalculation."
"The announcement that there is to be a reflection group on the future of Europe is not welcome."
"Why do we need yet another body when we have just had three years of self-imposed agonising over the Constitution?"
"Mr Brown says there will be no more institutional debate."
"He said, and I quote, 'It is time to focus on the economy, on security, on the environment'."
"Yet Mr Sarkozy in effect says, 'au contraire - it will think big'."
"As he said, and I quote, 'the job of the group is to define a new European dream.'"
"I thought that is what Mr Giscard d'Estaing was supposed to have done."
"I feel a little confused."
"Perhaps the Prime Minister can help me."
"- (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, alongside all the successes of the last six months, the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon is certainly the absolute highlight of the Portuguese Presidency."
"I think that this Treaty of Lisbon, which will also go down in the history books, is the third significant European treaty after the Treaty of Rome and the Maastricht Treaty."
"After the Nice Summit in December 2000, therefore exactly seven years ago, this Parliament showed a great deal of energy and commitment in achieving an improved European treaty and I believe the entire Parliament will thank you for the fact that it can now become a reality seven years on."
"It can become a reality if all 27 Member States also ratify it, as has been repeatedly stated here."
"Last week in Strasbourg I was shocked, to be frank, that there is a coalition of nine countries opposing Europe from the radical left to the radical right."
"Let us not be fooled: many who say here that they want to include citizens in truth merely want to confuse them and obstruct Europe."
"This is not about citizen participation, but about halting further European unity."
"One of the visions of the Treaty of Lisbon is the creation of a European democracy, and this is new: it does not exist anywhere in the world."
"May I say thank you that the regulation on the European parties has also come about under your Presidency."
"We really have created a masterpiece at first reading."
"It is also the basis for European political foundations and therefore for many platforms for setting up a European debate and publicity for Europe."
"I should like to say in conclusion, Mr Sócrates, that we have planted a seed here, which in just a few years will grow into a tall tree with many branches."
"I hope that these branches will already be visible in the campaign for the next European elections in June 2009."
"Many thanks for your Presidency."
"Mr President, I think our experience of the Presidency is that, where qualified majority voting is permitted to work, such as revising the financial perspectives to support Galileo, we make progress."
"Where QMV can be deployed but is not - such as the Working Time Directive - decisions are missed, compromises do not emerge and no progress is made."
"The Treaty of Lisbon extends QMV."
"Let us in the future show complete self-confidence in deploying it."
"But it is the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter that will endure as the lasting testament to a Presidency managed with skill, efficiency and charm."
"Obrigado."
"(SK) Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today our sitting closes one of the most important EU presidencies of the last decade."
"It has not been a typical six months in politics, with the presiding country striving to coordinate the EU Member States."
"Following the highly successful German Presidency, which succeeded in concluding the period of reflection on the Constitution, the Portuguese Presidency successfully oversaw the signing of the so-called Lisbon Treaty."
"As in the past, when Portugal entered the history books as a founder and discoverer of a new land, European modern history will remember Portugal as the founder of a new history within the framework of the European Union."
"I believe that the position of the European Parliament will, in the context of this agreement, have a far greater importance than it has had to date."
"Besides this fundamental document, the Portuguese Presidency is also to be commended for the European Union-Brazil summit as well as for the recently concluded European Union-Africa summit."
"Both of these summits have laid solid foundations for the activities of the countries that will hold the presidency in the future and for increasing the influence of the European Union in those parts of the world."
"Mr President, I would like to thank you for your endeavours and wish you a happy Christmas."
"Mr President, I would like to join in the thanks and congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency."
"I have a view, albeit a prejudiced view, that the smaller the nation, the better the presidency, but we will leave that aside for one moment."
"Thank you particularly for the work you did on the EU-Africa Summit, the EU-Brazil Summit, the integrated maritime policy and - above all - bringing the signing of the Lisbon Treaty to a conclusion."
"There will be no Treaty until all 27 Member States have ratified the Treaty."
"There is a danger, in the way we speak here and in the language we use and in the tense of our verbs, that there is an assumption that this Treaty is going to be ratified by all 27 Member States."
"My own Member State, Ireland, has to have a referendum, and we willingly have a referendum - even though I would be dishonest not to say that there was just a slight level of almost jealousy when I heard how easy it was for the Hungarians to ratify."
"The difficulty will be with the referendum in Ireland, with the risk - as in the previous referenda - that our electorate will take out their increasing frustration with the present government by being tempted to vote against the Lisbon Treaty referendum when that is not their intention at all."
"It would be really to give a kick to the government, a mid-term kick to the government you know where."
"And I appeal to my colleagues in Fine Gael, who will be doing everything possible to make sure this government successfully achieves the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty through the referendum, to get out there and to sell the message, to engage with the people, to invest in the message in a PR machine that will ensure that we give Europe the answer that it actually deserves."
"Nothing can be taken for granted."
"We need to remind our Irish electorate that it is only since we joined the European Union that Ireland has become truly independent, culturally and psychologically."
"Membership of the Union has broadened our horizons and encouraged us to look outwards."
"Ireland's success in leaving behind the oppressive legacy of colonialism and in building the new relationship with the UK, which has underpinned the Northern Ireland peace process, must be seen as a significant part of modern European history, paralleling the fundamental rapprochement between France and Germany."
"I admire Ireland's membership and contribution to the Union."
"I look around me at home and I see a confident, pluralistic society far removed from the introspective sectarian Ireland in which our parents and grandparents were raised."
"Europe has helped Ireland define our place in the wider world."
"We deserve to return that to Europe by ratifying the Lisbon Treaty."
"Take nothing for granted, colleagues, until it is done."
"It will not be easy."
"Ms Doyle, when you refer to the size of the country which has the Presidency, did you mean that the Irish Presidency could have been even better?"
"(Laughter)"
"(PL) Mr President, first of all I would like to acknowledge the work of the Portuguese Presidency, and that of Prime Minister José Sócrates in bringing about the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This is a major achievement for Europe, a very important and historic moment following years of deep crisis for the European Union."
"Meanwhile, all of the EU Member States will need to ratify this Treaty during the coming year."
"This will not be easy - we are currently witnessing the cynical manipulation of the instruments of direct democracy against European democracy."
"I have no hesitation in saying that those who today view the institution of referendums with cynicism do not do so in good faith."
"We witnessed this in Strasbourg a week ago, when various extremists from the European political scene raised the slogan of referendum, something that is of value in itself, against the European Treaty, and thus in fact against the European system of liberal democracy."
"Mr President, today I also wanted to mention something of a very personal nature."
"In Eastern Europe 25 years ago we raised the slogan of a Europe without borders against dictators in our country."
"Today, this week, Europe really has become a continent without borders - the European Union - in a symbolic, technical and organisational sense."
"This is a great moment for the peoples of the countries of the EU nations."
"- (ES) Mr President, I would like to appeal for responsibility on the part of the Council, the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission on the Soil Directive that is before the Council."
"After wide-ranging debates, Parliament approved a proposal that was much more open, less bureaucratic and much more flexible than the Commission's."
"It approved it after many debates, by 496 votes to 161."
"This was a message we sent to the Council, that it was unable to negotiate sufficiently last week."
"The Council and the Commission failed to understand that Parliament was proposing a new way of legislating in the Europe of 27, with different regulatory developments and experiences, and different bureaucratic systems."
"We need to look for new ways of getting closer to the citizen."
"The solution is not to legislate less, not a legislative blackout, but rather to find more open and flexible formulae as proposed by Parliament."
"We proposed a document defining the result to be achieved - as Article 249 of the Treaty says - and, in exchange, to leave to the Member States the choice of form and methods."
"If Europe wants to lead the way on climate change and the environment, it cannot rely only on policies based on regulation, taxation and the judicialisation of environment policy."
"We need to learn to understand one another in liberty and flexibility."
"That is what is being asked of a young Europe."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, I will begin by saying that this has been a Presidency in the service of Europe and a pro-European project."
"It has not been a Presidency to please everyone, but a Presidency for dividing the waters, receiving the praise of those who are in favour of Europe, but also suffering the protests of those who are against Europe."
"We are proud of that, too."
"Those who boo the speakers, those who try to disrupt the exercise of democracy in parliaments, need not apologise, because we have actually proclaimed here the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which enshrines tolerance as a fundamental European value, and tolerance even of those who do not understand the democratic spirit and behaviour."
"Next, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to say that I do not share the often puerile and infantile vision of those who believe that there is an absolutely fundamental separation between foreign and domestic politics."
"In my country the Portuguese Presidency is taken very seriously and all our Prime Ministers, myself included, have had the good sense to regard its work as crucial and a priority whenever the Portuguese Presidency has come round, because the European project is also an internal political issue for Portugal, not just about foreigners and Europe."
"No, it concerns us, the Portuguese."
"This is why the Prime Ministers have always given a priority commitment to European action and the European agenda, because we are well aware that, in European affairs, we defend our interests through the European project."
"Do you know what?"
"I also belong to a party, and fortunately a country, where we follow Churchill's rule: we never criticise or attack our own government abroad."
"We save it until we get home; then we make up for lost time when the government is in a position to defend itself."
"It is more loyal; that is how we behave in Portugal; that is the dignified way in which Portuguese tradition and the Portuguese political culture behaves when it has the EU Presidency."
"Next I would like to emphasise one important reason why I believe we have made progress this past year."
"We have made progress, if we look at Europe at the beginning of the year and we look at Europe at the end of this year, we will see that we have made progress, and we have made progress too in relation to the programme jointly defined by the three Presidencies, and that helped."
"This coordination between the three Presidencies, duly linked to the Commission's programme, helped Europe and I believe that it is my duty to give you my own experience;"
"I believe that this helped me a lot and helped to coordinate with the previous Presidency."
"I have always said of the Lisbon Treaty that it owed much to the previous Presidency, Angela Merkel's Presidency and her leadership to obtain a mandate, without which we would not have had the Treaty."
"Someone asked 'Why Brazil?'"
"That is an easy one."
"For the same reason that we have a strategic partnership with China, India and Russia, and not having one with Brazil is a mistake, because nothing is achieved in the world - I am just stating the politically obvious - nothing is achieved in the world in the environment, or in trade, without Brazil."
"Brazil today is a new international partner of major and vital importance and that is why I judge that the EU's external policy is better, more coherent and more comprehensive with a partnership with Brazil."
"Next, perseverance at the Africa summit; someone mentioned that, perseverance."
"That is it, we persevered."
"I remember well, a year and a half ago when we talked about the Africa summit, no one really believed we could pull it off."
"Everyone pointed to the difficulties and obstacles, but we persevered because we always felt that we were right, that it would be a mistake not to do it, and we always felt that there was a will to do it on both sides and we were right."
"That is another reason why the summit was a success."
"In the end, this Presidency moved Europe forward, that is what I wanted to say."
"However, we only moved forward; it is not the end of the story."
"No, we are far from the end of the story. Just a small step;"
"I am well aware of the scale of it; I am well aware that politics is a ceaseless effort, and as one task is completed there will be another one to be done."
"I am aware, too, that on migration we need to make progress with the 'blue card';"
"I am well aware that we need to go further on flexicurity;"
"I am well aware that there is much to be done, but we did move forward in all those areas."
"We did not move backwards; we did not stand still; we moved forward."
"After all, the European project over the past 50 years has consisted of nothing but small but firm steps forward."
"That is why I am telling you this, because I am firmly convinced that with the Portuguese Presidency we moved forward and made progress and what we did was for the good of the European project; nothing else, the European project, as I said, because we were always guided by the interests of our own country, which are defended through the European project."
"A country that wants to share its sovereignty with the others and wants to take part in this extraordinary adventure which is to see 27 countries share their sovereignty in areas that 20 years ago were regarded as areas of national security."
"Sharing that sovereignty is giving an example to the world of cooperation for peace, for development, and this is the European adventure."
"I just feel honoured to have made a small contribution to that and I would just like to leave you with the pride that the Portuguese feel for that."
"My country has always been pro-European."
"The Portuguese are very pro-European; they believe in Europe and, like me and many of you, they were also frustrated that Europe had been dragging its feet for three years."
"They wanted to overcome the deadlock; they wanted to move ahead."
"We have moved ahead and what is more we did so with a treaty that is named after our capital."
"I also wanted to tell you how proud and honoured my country feels to have had the opportunity to serve Europe over the past six months. Thank you very much."
"Commissioner. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to conclude a very interesting debate, I would like very quickly to highlight a point that Prime Minister José Sócrates also mentioned just now, which I think is an important lesson for the future."
"I think it is legitimate and fair - I have already done so and not just to be polite - to heartily congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on its work."
"The Presidency, however, also had the good grace to share the credit for this success with the other institutions and even with other Presidencies, notably the German Presidency, and the fact that we have already worked together with the next one, the Slovenian Presidency."
"I believe that it is important to reflect on these conclusions of the President-in-Office of the Council, the Prime Minister of Portugal, because, as Mrs Doyle rightly said, we have yet to ratify the Treaty."
"We must not split the European camp."
"In this Parliament, we have several political families, but after hearing some speeches, I had the impression that certain people think that we can now polarise the European debate again."
"It is natural and legitimate that various paths for the future of Europe should be expressed, and that the various political families should submit proposals that are often contradictory."
"What seems to me a grave error, which I frankly wish that no one will do again, would be to go back to attacking Brussels, or attacking the European Commission, or resort - on the right or the left - to facile criticisms of the European institutions."
"It would be a very grave error."
"The various political families, the various institutions, must make their proposals, but they must have the intelligence and political strategy not to split the European camp, especially not artificially."
"As the Portuguese Prime Minister, the President-in-Office, rightly said, there is a time and a place for everything; there is the national place and the European place."
"If we now split the pro-European camp, which ranges from left to right via the centre, but which is sincerely in favour of European progress, in my view that would be a very grave error."
"I say this with the authority of a Commission President who has always tried to make a modern agenda compatible with European competitiveness as a social vocation, has even tried to correct mistakes made earlier, not by my Commission, and has endeavoured - working loyally with the Council and Parliament - to reach new consensuses in favour of Europe."
"That is what I wanted to say, at Christmas time, in response to some speeches rather less in the Christmas spirit, to say that we at the Commission will continue our work fully committed, endeavouring to complete what has been an extraordinary project, that the work of the Portuguese Presidency - and I once again congratulate Prime Minister Sócrates and all his team - has left in a much better state than we have had for some time."
"The truth is this: when we think where Europe is today and where it was two or three years ago, we are right to be confident and I therefore wish you all an excellent 2008, full of success for each of you personally as well as for Europe."
"President of the Commission, many thanks to you, too, for your work."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to say just one thing: we have rightly complimented the Portuguese Presidency, we have commended the Commission, but without the European Parliament, this Treaty would no longer even be on the table and therefore we also have cause to be proud that we have always held our course with the great majority of the European Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - The signing of the Reform Treaty was the highlight of the Portuguese Presidency of the Council, and the news that the Hungarian Parliament has already ratified it (despite not yet having the benefit of the European Parliament's views on it, as we will vote in February) is welcome."
"There has been much comment on Gordon Brown's late arrival at the signing ceremony, which some claim as reluctance."
"In fact, it can be read the other way: despite the diary clash (with his first appearance as Prime Minister at the Commons Liaison Committee) making it impossible to be there in time for the ceremony, he insisted on going anyway to sign in person rather than leave it just to David Miliband, which would have been perfectly possible."
"in writing. - (PT) In this debate on the Portuguese Presidency, the President of the Council of the European Union placed special emphasis on the Treaty that takes up the essence of the so-called European Constitution, and to which he wishes to associate the name of Lisbon."
"Unfortunately, this has not been a good Presidency for the workers and poor of the European Union."
"One cannot be satisfied knowing that the Portuguese Presidency managed to consolidate the neo-liberal path, with even freer competition, so that economic and financial groups can impose their terms and prosper on the ruins of micro-enterprises and SMEs and the privatisation of public services, so that they can bring to bear their reading of flexicurity as a real weapon to exploit anyone who works, perpetuating the increasingly neo-liberal practical application of the Lisbon Strategy."
"As was clear from the debate, the European powers will try to consolidate and expand their power, seeking to circumvent the right of the peoples of each country to express their opinion on the Treaty in a referendum, after a democratic discussion of the content of the text that is to be signed."
"The propaganda campaign is being prepared by the powers and power elites which, in the various countries, support right-wing policies, attempting to escape referendums, except in Ireland, where it is compulsory."
"Ladies and gentlemen, on the occasion of the conclusion of the Portuguese Presidency I would like to express my satisfaction that as of 21 December 2007 the internal borders of the Schengen area will become a thing of the past."
"Prime Minister José Sócrates, I would like to express my appreciation and thanks for your personal involvement and Portugal's spirited stance in striving to make the free movement of persons, one of the four fundamental freedoms of the Union, a reality for the citizens of nine Member States, including my own, Slovakia, by the planned deadline."
"The road to this long-awaited freedom within the EU was not easy and on several occasions it seemed that the entire project had reached an impasse."
"A year ago there was not much to celebrate, as the European Commission was advising at that time that the date of the enlargement of the borderless area be deferred to 2009."
"This delay was caused by difficulties in the preparation of SIS II, designed to increase the potential of the present SIS and allow its enlargement to the East of the EU."
"Several Member States were unwilling to seek a solution; the Portuguese representatives, however, did not hesitate."
"Shortly after the first signs of a crisis, the approval of the elegant 'SISone4ALL' solution proposed by the Portuguese offered a glimmer of hope that the long-awaited enlargement of the Schengen area might be achieved."
"Thanks to the constructive approach and the subsequent determination of the Portuguese Presidency this year, we will have a Christmas without passport controls."
"Membership of committees and delegations: see Minutes"
"Dates for next sittings: see Minutes"
"Adjournment of the session"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session adjourned on Tuesday, 18 December 2007."
"Statements by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the first of our meetings to be held in the new year 2008."
"May I wish every one of you health and happiness and hope that together we are successful in the tasks that have been entrusted to us, namely to take the European Union forward to a positive future."
"Allow me to make a few remarks about the work we have to do."
"On the day the European Parliament held its last sitting here in Strasbourg, namely 13 December 2007, the Reform Treaty was signed in Lisbon."
"In a short speech that I made - in the presence of the President of the European Council, José Socrates, and EC President, José Manuel Barroso - I expressed the will of the great majority of the European Parliament that the Reform Treaty should become a legal, and hence a political, reality by 1 January 2009."
"This objective remains the priority of priorities for the year 2008."
"On 21 December border restrictions were lifted for those nine countries that joined the European Union on 1 May 2004."
"These were indeed moving events."
"For hundreds of years soldiers had forced their way across the national borders of our continent to inflict war, misery and suffering on others."
"The removal of the barriers between our nations means this: our neighbours welcome us."
"We are all common citizens of the European Union, and as it says in the Berlin Declaration of 25 March 2007: 'We are united for the better'."
"(Applause)"
"Malta and Cyprus joined the European Monetary Union on 1 January."
"Our common currency, the Euro, is therefore the official means of payment in both these countries."
"We extend our warmest welcome to Malta and Cyprus."
"(Applause)"
"The European Year of Intercultural Dialogue was celebrated in Ljubljana on 9 January at an impressive ceremony attended by members of the European Council, Commission and Parliament."
"The Intercultural Dialogue will be a key feature of our work during the coming year and will remain so."
"I would ask you all to be present tomorrow for the statement by the Grand Mufti of Syria, Sheikh Ahmad Badr Al-Din Hassoun."
"Let me now move on to two final items: our legislative work this year will be significantly influenced by climate and environmental issues."
"As legislators we owe much responsibility to climate and environmental protection, on the one hand, and to the protection of European competitiveness and to the safeguarding of jobs, on the other."
"Together we have to strike the right balance between the economy and the ecology."
"The European Union is based on values, rights and responsibilities."
"On 12 December 2007 the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission signed the Charter of Fundamental Rights here in this very Chamber."
"This marked a significant event for the citizens of the European Union and for the European Parliament too."
"During the signing a number of members interrupted the proceedings with loud heckling and attempted to prevent the speakers from being heard."
"Nothing can justify such behaviour."
"(Applause)"
"Free speech is the basis of democracy and of parliamentarianism."
"Every Member of the European Parliament is entitled freely to express his or her opinion in any of the designated debates."
"It is our common duty to protect this right at all times."
"What is more, to prevent speakers from addressing the European Parliament, and especially when they are guests in this House, offends against the basic rights of freedom, democracy and parliamentarianism."
"(Applause)"
"This also means that it contravenes our Rules of Procedure, which cannot be accepted under any circumstances."
"I therefore intend to take action, as provided for in the Rules of Procedure, against those Members who continued in their attempt to interrupt the proceedings, despite repeated requests from the Chair to desist."
"(Applause)"
"The same applies to those Members who behaved in an unseemly way towards our ushers, who were only carrying out their proper duties."
"(Applause)"
"The new year will pose great challenges for us."
"However, I am convinced that we will overcome these by showing respect and consideration for each other."
"It is very much with this in mind that I would again wish you all the very best for 2008."
"(Applause)"
"Approval of the minutes"
"The Minutes for the sitting of Tuesday, 18 December 2007 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, before we get to the agenda, I would like a little clarification on an item on the agenda for tomorrow morning, which you have already mentioned: the address by the Grand Mufti of Syria."
"His will be the first of a series of speeches by religious leaders before the plenary of this House in the context of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"I would like to know why the Conference of Presidents has chosen to interpret intercultural dialogue exclusively as an interreligious monologue and whether it feels a part-session is an appropriate platform for religious messages."
"(Applause)"
"Finally, I would like to know whether the Conference of Presidents is willing to consider widening the list of guest speakers and making it more representative by including women and non-religious organisations."
"The ALDE Group has suggested that Ms Jahangir, the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, should be invited to address the plenary as well."
"I hope you can enlighten me."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mrs in 't Veld."
"If I recall correctly, this was in fact a unanimous decision taken by the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit has doubts about this, so we shall check it out."
"In any case, it was a decision taken by a very big majority, wherein we also said that the list did not have to be conclusive and that we would also be calling on the various committees of the European Parliament, in particular, to propose further activities on which we could then vote."
"Mrs in 't Veld, you can be assured that in this case the discussion was as broad as possible and that we also remain open to further proposals, though of course these will have to be decided on by the Conference of Presidents or by Parliament."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to point out that my Group did not agree."
"I would just point out once more that your Group was evidently not in agreement."
"We shall check this again in the Minutes, not because we question what you have said but to ensure that the Minutes are also accurate."
"In any case, the decision was taken by a majority of the kind rarely seen in the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr President, I would just like to add to the point made by Ms in 't Veld."
"As I said in an email addressed to you and copied to other Members this morning, another regrettable fact is that it seems that you have made the Grand Mufti comparable to the Pope and the UK Chief Rabbi as a European representative of his particular religion."
"I think that sends a very bad signal to Muslims who are European."
"The visit tomorrow demands every courtesy - although one would like an exchange of views about human rights abuses in Syria."
"I hope, however, that in your future list of invitees this year you will make sure that a European representative of Islam is invited and not somebody from outside the EU who might be taken to represent Muslims in Europe - which he does not."
"Mrs Ludford, even with all goodwill and understanding for one another it will surely never be possible to reach a hundred per cent agreement on matters of this kind."
"Even so, I can tell you that the Group chairmen reached their decision by a large majority. With goodwill it will also be possible to balance this out through the activities of our various committees so that everyone feels included in the result."
"I would now really like to ask that you treat our guests, when they arrive, with consideration and respect. After all, we want to promote dialogue not prevent it."
"This is essentially my plea to everyone."

"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 10 January 2008, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"Monday:"
"No amendments."
"Tuesday:"
"The PPE-DE Group has proposed that the two Demetriou and Cashman reports on the control of persons at the EU's external borders be postponed to a subsequent sitting."
"- (EL) Mr President, this report seems to have the Council's full approval in substance, but there is a procedural issue, since Coreper has not yet met - I think it is to meet tomorrow or the day after. Furthermore, the Slovenian Presidency has asked, for procedural and official reasons, for the meeting to be postponed until the next plenary part-session in Belgium."
"There is no objection to this postponement."
"(Parliament adopted the motion.)"
"Wednesday:"
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe moved that the debate on the statements of the Council and Commission on the situation in Pakistan following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto be concluded with the submission of motions for a resolution."
"Mr President, we have over the holiday break seen a number of very worrying developments in Pakistan, not least, of course, the assassination of Benazir Bhutto."
"We have the opportunity to discuss this matter this week."
"It is the view of my group that we should close our debate with a resolution, in particular since we should take a position sending a message to the Pakistani authorities in advance of the visit of Mr Musharaff to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House."
"Does anyone else wish to speak in support of the motion?"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that it is very poor practice indeed for important debates to be concluded without a resolution."
"This Parliament is here to take clear positions and not just to be a talking shop for group chairmen and other group spokespersons without the adoption of resolutions."
"Mr Musharraf will be coming here and he should know what this Parliament thinks about the situation in his country, so that we can argue the matter out with him."
"I believe we should be bold enough to put an end to the old habit of postponing the adoption of decisions for fear of acting on our own courage, by voting for a resolution."
"(Parliament rejected the motion.)"
"In view of the shortage of speaking time for the Wednesday afternoon sitting, the Socialist Group has moved that the debates be extended to 6 p.m."
"With the agreement of the Council, Question Time can be extended until 7.30 p.m."
"(DE) Mr President, you have said everything there is to say as far as the explanatory statement is concerned."
"It is a good thing that Council Question Time has not been shortened as a result."
"I just wanted to bring this to your attention."
"(Parliament adopted the motion.)"
"(The agenda was therefore adopted.)"
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"- (MT) May I express my thanks for your good wishes to my country, Malta, which together with Cyprus joined the Euro area two weeks ago, bringing the number of countries using the Euro as their currency to 15."
"This means that the majority of EU Member States now use the same currency."
"During the celebrations held in Malta two days ago the Presidents of the Council and the Commission and also Mario Mauro, Vice-President of the European Parliament, all congratulated Malta on the rapid progress it had made in the three years since it joined the European Union and on its transition to the Euro, which is going well and without any problems."
"In fact, despite the fact that the dual circulation period runs until the end of this month, I can state that after just two weeks almost all transactions are already being carried out in euros."
"The people of Malta and Gozo are proud to embrace the Euro and to have made another great step forward in the process of European union."
"(FR) Mr President, in December the European Court of Justice handed down a long-awaited judgment that has very worrying implications for the protection of posted workers in Europe."
"It sends a negative signal to our citizens, who are concerned about the risks of social dumping."
"What does the Court say in this so-called 'Laval' ruling?"
"It says that the Swedish trade unions were wrong to try to force a Latvian undertaking to sign their collective agreement, in particular with regard to the minimum wage."
"Under the 1996 Directive, however, posted workers have to observe a nucleus of mandatory rules for minimum protection in the host Member State."
"The Court rules that the Swedish system of collective bargaining was not applicable and that such rules could only be imposed by the law."
"The European message is thus no longer clear: on the one hand, the Commission prioritises flexicurity and the system of collective bargaining as a model; on the other hand, the Court of Justice discredits this model."
"Parliament and the Council must therefore clarify this issue."
"Otherwise, it would be like throwing the Bolkestein Directive out the front door only to allow it to sneak in the back, which would be entirely unacceptable."
"Mr President, I rise on a matter which refers particularly to one Member State but, I believe, has wider European implications."
"This year is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"One institution which does much to promote intercultural dialogue is the British Council."
"It is therefore of particular concern that Russia seeks to close the offices of the British Council in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg."
"The work of the British Council in Russia is perfectly legal."
"It is regulated by a 1994 cultural agreement between London and Moscow."
"I therefore request that the matter be raised by colleagues with Russia in the context of our interparliamentary dialogue and that you, Mr President, use any opportunity which presents itself to express concern to the Russian authorities that a cultural matter, regulated by a perfectly normal agreement between two countries, is being trodden upon in an attempt by the Russian authorities to stifle political debate."
"(PL) Mr President, the House has debated the problems associated with the demographic shortfall threatening Europe on many occasions, that is to say, we have discussed the consequent social problems."
"At the same time, VAT on children's goods in the European Union is charged at the basic rate, in other words, at the highest possible rate."
"Children's goods were subject to a special lower rate in Poland before my country joined the Union."
"One of the legal implications of Poland's entry into the Union unfortunately involved raising the VAT rate on children's goods, which ran counter to the family-orientated policy adopted by Poland."
"I call on the European Commission to consider amending the relevant provisions for the benefit of all Member States of the Union, and in particular for the benefit of the poorest families bringing up children."
"This would help us all to implement the Lisbon Strategy."
"(ES) Mr President, the Commission's Work Programme for 2008 states that the citizen is and should be the core of the European project."
"Extrapolating on this idea, I believe that the European Union is not approaching the Kosovo process in the correct manner."
"We cannot continue to debate whether this or that international situation is appropriate for recognising Kosovo's independence."
"One question must take precedence over all the others: what do the people of Kosovo want?"
"They are the most important of all. The key to resolving the conflicts lies in two elements: respect for human rights and recognition of their right as a people to decide freely on their future."
"I believe that the European Union should use these words as a reference for situations that arise both within and outside its borders."
"- (CS) I would like to talk about an awkward issue, which is the widespread campaign against smoking and smokers in the European Union, a campaign which is also based on legal acts passed by the European Parliament."
"There is no doubt that the motivation for the campaign is a noble one, as it relates to citizens' health."
"However, in my opinion it is also highlighting issues which are not dignified and which discriminate against a large section of society, which has practically been criminalised due to its dependence on smoking."
"The heavy financial losses of pub-type establishments in the countries that introduced a ban on smoking in restaurants cannot be overlooked either."
"I presume that the attention that is given to smokers should also appropriately be given to the tobacco industry."
"It is not a secret that for decades some ingredients have been added to tobacco, such as nitrosamines, which are nitrogen compounds that cause cancer and an increased absorption of nicotine."
"In most cases the damage to a human being is caused not by nicotine but by these very admixtures."
"In my opinion, tobacco production and the composition of tobacco products should also be subject to regulation."
"Mr President, three years ago this month, Robert McCartney was brutally murdered by IRA members in Belfast."
"Abhorrence at that murder reached this House when the McCartney sisters brought here and put their case for justice in respect of that."
"Three years on, justice still evades them."
"Why?"
"Primarily because the party which could help the most - Sinn Fein - is still more interested in protecting their own than seeing the killers brought to justice."
"Indeed, the situation has worsened, because pressure on Sinn Fein has been eased by their admission to government, with the result that, for the sake of maintaining that government, those like my former party the DUP are prepared to let Sinn Fein off the hook."
"Tragically, justice for Robert McCartney is secondary to maintaining the 'chuckle coalition' at Stormont."
"Likewise with the more recent murder of Paul Quinn, undoubtedly by the military wing of Sinn Fein - it, too, will be shamefully whitewashed and swept under the carpet."
"That is what happens when you treat with the forces of terrorism."
"(EL) Mr President, in our first part-session of the New Year, I would like to talk about the political crisis, which continues to beset Lebanon be mired and the role that our Parliament should play."
"Together with the complex economic and political problems faced by this friendly nation, there is still an institutional vacuum, because since 23 November 2007 it has not been possible for its parliament to elect a president; this election has been postponed 12 times. Thus parliament remains closed and there is no possibility of discussing problems and prospects, or of putting to good use all the parliament's constitutional powers to elect a president."
"I am aware of your sensitivity and the messages that you have sent to try to achieve this aim, Mr President, but I want to stress once again that we must express our deep unease concerning the consequences of this crisis for the suffering people of Lebanon, as well as for peace and stability in the region."
"Our democratic duties oblige us to do this, as do our obligations within the partnership."
"The association agreement with Lebanon provides for a stable political dialogue between the European Parliament and the Lebanese Parliament; we must make good use of this opportunity and send an effective message."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Slovenia, the only country of the former Yugoslavia to have joined the European Union, has now taken over the Presidency of the Union."
"On the occasion of this historic event we would like to wish it every success with its Presidency."
"Nonetheless, there has never been a more pressing need to resolve the Yugoslavian crisis once and for all, be it the Kosovo issue or speeding up the accession of its Balkan neighbours."
"The only solution for the countries that were part of the former Yugoslavia is swift accession to the Union, in accordance with the established criteria."
"Peace requires an ambitious vision and, in particular, the will to move beyond the Balkans' history and look towards a European future."
"To date, the Kosovo issue has not been resolved because the international community has been unable to come to an agreement."
"The European Union has also been a victim of this deadlock, this syndrome."
"Between the countries that are fearful of the effects of independence and those who dream only of validating their independence as soon as possible for various diplomatic reasons, Slovenia will initially have to ensure the cohesion of the Union by seeking first and foremost an internal compromise, if the EU's foreign policy as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon is not to be trivialised or even ridiculed."
"We know, nevertheless, that Mount Triglav in Slovenia symbolises determination and accomplishment."
"Let us hope therefore that it will be the symbol of 2008!"
"(SL) Croatia announced an environmental/ fishing zone in the Adriatic in October 2003."
"Slovenia and Italy objected to it."
"This led a year later to the signing of an agreement between Slovenia, Italy, the European Union and Croatia."
"According to that agreement the zone does not affect the Member States."
"In spite of that, the Croatian Assembly decided unilaterally last year that the environmental/fishing zone would affect the Member States as well from 1 January of this year at the latest."
"The Assembly thereby made the lives of people living around the Adriatic difficult."
"This unilateral decision by Croatia presented problems for fishermen, for example, because it reduced their fishing territory and the port of Koper lost its access to international waters."
"The Assembly's decision that the environmental/fishing zone should affect the Member States from 1 January of this year is contrary to the international obligation accepted by Croatia and gives reason to doubt its credibility."
"Obligations adopted by a country should not be violated in modern, democratic, legal states."
"It totally contradicts the political culture of the European Union."
"I therefore wonder if Croatia truly wishes to become a member of the European Union."
"If it does, it must act immediately and start complying with the agreement on the environmental/fishing zone as well as with all other agreements reached thus far."
"(HU) The Szigetköz, lying partly in Austria and Slovakia and the Hungarian stretch of the Danube, is one of the most beautiful areas in Europe."
"It is an island of biodiversity with its natural features, the wealth of its fauna and flora, its water habitats and the traditional way of life of the people who live there."
"Unfortunately the flow rate of the river nourishing this region has dropped to danger level over the past decades due to hydrological interference."
"It is not just in the interests of the area affected but in the interests of Hungary and the entire Union that this unique natural asset is not lost to future generations."
"We already have good laws, such as the Water Framework Directive, which should in principle protect the region."
"However for these to be successful they need to be enforced at national and Union level."
"It would be desirable for Slovakia, regardless of the Nagy-Duna matter, to cooperate with Hungary in stabilising the water supply to this area."
"I would like to invite you on a tour in this romantic landscape in the Spring, but unfortunately we cannot do it without water, and so we need every possible assistance."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of this House to the fate of two French journalists, Pierre Creisson and Thomas Dandois, who are currently in prison in Niger."
"They are accused of undermining state security, which carries a possible death sentence in Niger."
"There is no doubt that the two journalists and their driver, Al-Hassane, broke Niger laws by entering a prohibited area."
"In my opinion, however, it was for sound journalistic reasons because their aim was to report on the Tuareg rebellion, and they also intended to return to the capital to question the Niger authorities so that they would have as broad a view as possible."
"I therefore believe that it is essential for us to take action to help these two journalists: firstly, because they risk being sentenced to death, a punishment that is out of all proportion with their actions, and secondly, because Niger is considered to be a friend of ours and a country that we help a great deal."
"It would not deserve the reputation that this attitude could generate."
"I believe, Mr President, that you and my fellow Members could be of great assistance if you participate in this request for reflection, for clemency from President Tandja, so that these two journalists can be released."
"Even though they did break Niger laws, their actions do not warrant such a long imprisonment."
"We shall monitor all this very carefully."
"(PL) Mr President, I take the floor today as a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and also as a citizen of a country that has been forced to fight for its independence and freedom on many occasions."
"I should like to draw the attention of the House to the lack of respect for human rights and denial of freedom of expression in the People's Republic of China, as this affects the inhabitants of Tibet."
"The latest example of the regime's policy towards Tibet is the repression of the monks who expressed their delight at the award of the Congressional Gold Medal to the Dalai Lama."
"The Dalai Lama has also received the Nobel Prize and has been fighting for respect for human rights over several decades."
"We cannot allow Tibet or any other 21st century nation to be extinguished by a dictatorship, a tyranny, or by the sadistic desire to exert political dominance. The House must say 'stop'."
"It must say 'stop' to attacks on a culture that is deemed to be the most peaceful culture on earth."
"As free people committed to the fundamental values of the European Union, we should do all in our power to ensure that the people of Tibet can also come to understand the true meaning of the word freedom."
"(DE) Mr President, we are very shocked at the Russian Government's closure of all the regional offices of the British Council."
"These regional offices have been sacrificed as a result of the worsening relations between Russia and the United Kingdom."
"Can civil society in Russia expect nothing more than this kind of provocation?"
"The murder of Alexander Litvinenko has still not been solved and Russia refuses to cooperate in the matter."
"The chief suspect, Andrei Lugovoi, has been a member of the Duma since the end of 2007."
"The circumstances surrounding the death of Anna Politkovskaya have also still not been explained."
"Is criticism being stifled under a mantle of secrecy or is it simply being eradicated?"
"The EU must call on Russia to respect human rights and the rule of law."
"We can set an example by naming our press office after Anna Politkovskaya."
"(PT) Mr President, following on from the third round of negotiations between the Polisario Front, the only legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people, and the Kingdom of Morocco, which took place under the auspices of the United Nations on 8 and 9 January, I must stress the current necessity and importance of demanding full respect for the inalienable right of the Sahrawi people to self-determination."
"This is the only fair and lasting solution to this dispute and is also in accordance with international law and the UN resolutions."
"The Moroccan authorities must be told to end their dilatory manoeuvring, which is aimed at delaying and, if possible, boycotting the current negotiation process."
"The Moroccan authorities must also be told to end the repression and colonisation of the occupied territories of the Western Sahara."
"Mr President, Mr Hu Jia, an AIDS campaigner, a human rights activist and nominee of this Parliament for the Sakharov Prize in 2007 was arrested in Beijing on 27 December 2007 by the Chinese authorities and charged with subversion."
"I am an admirer of the progress made in recent decades in China; however, the arrest of Mr Hu Jia by the Chinese sends out completely the wrong message, one that is very difficult for us to understand."
"Are the Chinese going to ignore the commitment they made to the international community when they promised to improve the human rights situation in China in return for the Beijing Olympics?"
"We as a parliament need to respond very firmly to protect this man who is now incarcerated, most probably for cooperating with the European Parliament when he gave testimony to the Subcommittee on Human Rights in November 2007."
"We also need to lend support to those campaigners in China seeking his release."
"Since diplomatic language alone would only be regarded as acquiescence in Chinese culture, I believe we need a strong parliamentary resolution - hopefully this week - to protect Mr Hu Jia."
"I urge you, Mr President, to raise the case of Mr Hu Jia with the Chinese authorities: it is imperative they hear the views of this Parliament."
"Mr President, I rise to raise what may seem, on the face of it, a rather mundane issue: the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive of 2000 in Ireland."
"The sad fact is that this Directive is being implemented in Ireland by the Irish Government by charging schools for water usage."
"Because most schools in Ireland are funded to a large extent by voluntary fundraising, this essentially means that parents must raise the money to pay for the water."
"That would be bad enough, but the Irish Government has decided to blame Europe for this decision, when of course it is entirely a matter for the Irish Government as to what policy it implements in relation to implementing the Water Directive."
"The sensitivity of the issue arises because we are having a referendum in Ireland to make a political decision, and a cowardly political tactic to blame Europe for the Government's decision runs the risk of alienating all the parents in Ireland against Europe."
"This is, in my view, a serious matter and I would urge the President of Parliament and the Vice-President of the Commission, who is here today, to make it clear to the Irish Government and to make a public statement to the effect that they are free to charge or not to charge schools for water and that they should not be taking risks with the future of Europe with cowardly political tactics."
"Mr President, in some of our Member States it is possible for people to walk in off the street and receive training in the use of guns, and indeed Magnum guns, without any identification whatsoever, or without having a gun licence."
"I raise this here because there is evidence to suggest that organised criminals in Ireland are coming to parts of the European Union for such training and then returning to Ireland and murdering people through gangland murders."
"Often innocent bystanders are murdered as well."
"I raise this because, in November, Parliament approved a new directive, and that directive is now with the Council."
"I urge the Council to approve this directive this month so that it will pass at first reading."
"Secondly, I want to ask the Commission not to wait until this is transposed into national law in 27 Member States - that could take up to two years - but to start implementing some of the provisions, one of which is to set up a contact group of the 27 Member States with the Commission to start working to counteract the illegal use of weapons."
"I urge that this be done without further delay."
"(ET) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"We have been keeping an eye on Georgia for some time now."
"The Presidential elections are over and finally the result is clear."
"Revolution, it is said, devours its own children."
"President Saakashvili was probably somewhat overcome by his fear of it."
"The exercise of physical power by a country is the sign not of the country's might but of its weakness."
"Objectively, we should note that following the suppression of demonstrations there, Georgia at least tried to hold democratic elections."
"Democracy, however, is not a thing."
"It is a way of thinking and cannot be removed one day or transplanted from one country to another."
"Considerable opposition has emerged in Georgia."
"In the name of democratic progress we should help government circles to understand the nature of the essential ingredients of democracy."
"Georgia must find the strength within itself to step back from crisis."
"Parliamentary elections are in the offing."
"The country needs democratic reforms to continue and the people are expecting nothing less."
"It would be wrong of us in the European Union to stake things on one individual."
"What we should do is support institutions, provide expert assistance, and honestly and openly point to any aspects which are incompatible with democracy."
"Finally I would like to say that what is happening in Georgia is perhaps also the key for Armenia."
"Presidential elections are also in the offing there."
"(PL) Mr President, for the period 2008-2012 the European Commission has allocated Poland the right to emit only 208 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. That is almost 30% less than the amount the Polish Government applied for."
"Poland has appealed against this decision to the European Court of Justice, but unfortunately it is not known when in the future the Court will rule on the matter. The Polish economy therefore has to adjust to the low limit set."
"Cement works, steel works and other undertakings have to cut their production. Most importantly, there will be a marked rise in the cost of electricity."
"It is estimated that prices will rise by approximately 10% this year and by 20% over four years, because the emission limits have also significantly affected the electricity-generating industry."
"Imposing emission limits in this way, and sharing the burden involved unfairly, will not only slow down the development of new Member States such as Poland, but it will also impact significantly on the cost of living for their citizens."
"I wish to register a strong protest against this."
"(FR) Mr President, on Friday, 11 January I was refused access to the Lille-Lesquin Detention Centre for foreigners."
"My visit was part of the European Action Week against the detention of foreigners in Europe."
"Mr President, in July 2003, following, in fact, a request by the then President of our Parliament and Vice-President Onesta, the French authorities were obliged to stipulate that the rules that apply to visits by Members of the French Parliament and Senators also apply to Members of the European Parliament."
"I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to speak to the French authorities once again to ensure that the commitments they made at that time are fully respected and, in particular, that Members of the European Parliament are treated in the same way as Members of the French Parliament."
"This is all the more pertinent as the Members of this Parliament are currently examining a proposal for a directive on the return of third-country nationals, which could have very serious consequences for the detention of foreigners."
"I would add that unannounced visits to detention centres are aimed at preventing ill-treatment, which generally goes unpunished in France, as indicated in the most recent report by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture."
"(RO) I am speaking today to bring to your attention the position of Romanian farmers one year after Romania's accession."
"In Romania, agriculture is still inefficient or not efficient enough, and yet it is a vital occupation for most of the population."
"Farmers make up a significant proportion of the working population, but there is also a significant number of elderly farmers."
"In this context, I welcome the Commission's decision not to activate the safeguard clause in this field; however, this is not enough."
"In 2008, European disbursements will amount to 25% of the European average; only in 9 years' time will Romania be able to reach that average."
"Over the last few years, Romania has been quick to transpose the acquis in the qualitative, health and phytosanitary fields."
"Adjustment costs can be a major obstacle to Romanian farmers taking advantage of the common agricultural policy."
"Romania is the second largest agricultural producer in Central Europe, after Poland, and it is only by capitalizing on European funding that this potential can be intelligently exploited and put to good use."
"(SK) The December session of the European Parliament was incorrectly informed that radio broadcasting for minorities in Slovakia is about to end and that the public service is closing down the Rádio Patria broadcasting in minority languages."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Slovak broadcasting service is not preparing any restrictions concerning Rádio Patria."
"On the contrary, since January 2007 Rádio Patria has, for the first time in its history, an independent broadcasting radius, which covers 100% of the Slovak Republic."
"It broadcasts daily 8-10 hours of high-quality programming that consists of news, journalism and culture."
"That is more than ever before."
"No other European public service offers a similar range of broadcasting services for national minorities."
"Mr Chairman, it is sad when a Member of the European Parliament imagines that in a democracy one can say anything without having verified whether it is correct."
"Such attacks result in tension and they are detrimental to the good name of the country."
"(SL) Slovenia has taken over the Presidency of the European Union, and the Prime Minister of its government, who is also the President of the Council of the European Union, has already made two assessments of the extremely dramatic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which differ from the earlier assessments of the situation in that country."
"He said that the situation was so dramatic as to be worse than in Kosovo."
"This provoked very heated reactions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the institutions of the Federation and in those of Republika Srpska, as well as among the population as a whole."
"Even the High Representative, Mr Lajčák himself, had not given such a bleak assessment so far."
"It seems to me, therefore, that the assessment is unrealistic, incorrect and unprofessional and does not provide the motivation for institutions or citizens of that country to be more successful in getting closer to the European Union."
"It seems to me that, at this point in time, with issues as sensitive as Bosnia and Herzegovina, we need more harmonisation among the institutions of the European Union."
"(PL) In September 2006 the European Parliament appealed for an end to trade in seal products."
"A record number of Members supported that declaration."
"Unfortunately, however, despite such strong support and Parliament's subsequent adoption of the so-called Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals, calling for a total ban on trade in seal products on the territory of the European Union, no positive outcome has been achieved."
"The ban has proved ineffective and has not put an end to trade in seal fur within the Union, which remains one of the largest markets for such fur."
"Young seals just a few days above the age protected under the ban are hunted for commercial purposes and sold legally."
"The hunting methods fail to comply with even the most elementary principles. The animals are skinned whilst still alive and their bodies then dumped in the water."
"This slaughter will continue as long as the European Commission does not impose a total ban on trade in all seal products."
"Mr President, we have two million drug addicts in the European Union."
"We have a drug epidemic, which has to be tackled head-on."
"Fifteen years ago in Ireland, drug addiction was confined to Dublin."
"Now it is in every city, town and village: heroin, cannabis, cocaine."
"People are dying every day in Ireland and within the EU from drug addiction."
"I welcome the current eight-year EU drug strategy."
"But we have to ask ourselves realistically: is it working?"
"We need to tackle the drug problem on all fronts."
"First of all, we need to cut off supply."
"Secondly, we need to try and persuade users to stop using drugs and to try and persuade people never to start using them, by means of high-profile advertising campaigns to simply frighten people."
"Last but by no means least, we need more and better international cooperation."
"(RO) 2008 is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"This is an opportunity for all 27 Member States to promote their culture, history, language and traditions."
"The Union's motto is ”Unity in diversity”, and 2008 should make a real contribution to strengthening cohesion within the Union, using intercultural dialogue as a basis."
"Over the centuries, Romania has been under various influences - Byzantine, Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman."
"86% of the Romanian population are Eastern Orthodox, and Romania is the only Romance-speaking country where Eastern Orthodoxy is dominant."
"I would like to emphasize that 18 denominations enjoy official recognition in Romania."
"However, intercultural dialogue should include interdenominational dialogue."
"I would like to ask the 34 delegations of the European Parliament to enhance their promotion of European values on other continents in the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, and to facilitate the knowledge of other cultures and traditions."
"It is my hope that the intercultural dialogue of 2008 will make an effective contribution to fostering peace, one of the European Union's fundamental values."
"(DE) Mr President, the matter I wish to raise follows directly on from what Mrs Ţicău has just said: the 2008 Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"I agree with this and respect the fact that the Conference of Presidents has taken certain decisions, but I note with some regret that the religious representatives that are to speak here, with the exception of the Pope, all come from outside Europe."
"Do we not have enough religious leaders here in Europe who can be invited to address this House?"
"I therefore believe that it would make sense, and indeed you have just touched on this, Romania being a large Orthodox country, to invite as speakers to this House not only the Pope and Protestant church leaders - for there is also an intercultural dialogue between Christians - but Orthodox representatives too."
"I would therefore request that you also consider extending an invitation to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomaios as part of this Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"(ES) Mr President, with this new year two new countries have joined the Euro zone and adopted our single currency."
"This brings to the forefront once again a demand that should already be a reality in an advanced, modern and progressive Union: gender equality on new coins."
"This has been a constant theme in history: women have scarcely ever been portrayed on newly minted coins."
"Female figures, contributions and work have never been given any symbolic recognition, not only in this respect."
"Gender equality is one of the values on which we are building the European Union and in that context equality should extend to all areas."
"It is important to recognise and support the action of so many women in different spheres - science, culture, education, politics - whose work, lives and names should be recognised, studied and remembered."
"In some countries, such as my own, Spain, the Parliament has approved a proposal to this end."
"This Parliament and the Commission should take the necessary initiatives and recommend to all the Member States that they take the appropriate measures to ensure that when Euro coins are being minted, equal consideration be given to references and images of both men and women."
"Mr President, one of my colleagues has suggested that a mundane matter has been brought up in this House, and that is the implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Ireland."
"I think it is anything but mundane."
"If it is mundane, we need to have more debates on it, because the Irish Government has got itself into hot water by blaming Europe for forcing it to charge schools for water, when in fact the issue is how it is underfunding schools and how badly it is communicating and implementing this important piece of legislation."
"What is at risk is the view the Irish have of the European Union, because we constantly blame Europe for decisions that we are unhappy with, even though the government is party to the process of decision-making."
"At a time when we are facing a referendum on the Reform Treaty, not only are parents looking at the EU with a side glance and believing it is the problem, but farmers and other lobby groups are also certainly not happy with the European Union at the moment."
"Therefore, the Irish Government needs to explain fully how it is implementing this Directive; it needs to fund the schools properly and it needs to answer the question of if and when domestic rates will be levied on Irish people."
"That is what we need to know at this stage."
"That concludes the item."
"CARS 21: A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on CARS 21: A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, the report that we are discussing is in fact only a report on a report, namely that which was drawn up by the Commission on the motor car of the future."
"However, on 19 December the European Commission adopted a proposal relating to future permitted CO2 emissions from passenger cars."
"The public is therefore naturally interested to see how the European Parliament will react to this proposal and the extent to which the decisions taken by Parliament are consistent with others that have been adopted more recently."
"We have just been debating and voting on the report presented by my colleague Chris Davies and it is therefore important that we should also be consistent."
"I would like to say something about this at a later point, for the CARS 21 report also covers many aspects that have nothing whatsoever to do with CO2 emissions."
"It is very important that we should concern ourselves in this House with the subject of motor vehicles. Why?"
"Because we have been discussing the Lisbon agenda for years now, and because all this while we have been debating the competitiveness of European industry."
"Here we have a sector where we really are competitive. In the premium market, for example, Europe has been setting the standard at international level."
"More than 80% of the world's top-of-the-range motor cars come from Europe."
"The industry is one of the cornerstones of Europe's economy and is also a key factor for European competitiveness."
"CARS 21 stands for Competitive Automotive Regulatory System for the 21st Century."
"This is a Communication from the Commission, which in 2005 set up the CARS 21 High Level Group in order to draw up proposals for a future regulatory framework for the EU automotive industry."
"The aim of this exercise was to identify the adjustments that would have to be made to the automotive industry in order to keep this sector competitive in the years ahead."
"It is not possible, at this point, to go into all the proposals that were made. However, the members of the European Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have drawn up a list of 89 of these."
"I cannot deal with them all here, but they relate to issues such as road safety, environmental protection, the internal market, global trade, research and innovation, and many other things besides."
"Let me just single out a few of the aspects involved."
"We need to complete the internal market for car tuning parts and spares, for example."
"It is unfair that German automotive tuning companies, for instance, are not allowed to sell products such as wheels in Italy because that country bans after-market tuning parts, while Italian manufacturers on the other hand can export to any country they choose, including Germany."
"Here Europe needs a proper internal market for tuning and spare parts and we also need equal safety standards for the automotive tuning sector."
"In addition, we need to introduce an EU-wide type-approval system, for there are blatant discrepancies in this area at the present time."
"Here is something else too: we need a more simplified system for regulating type-approval procedures for used vehicles acquired within the EU and elsewhere."
"Some national states have set high obstacles and built up a massive bureaucracy that makes it very difficult for dealers and private buyers of used vehicles."
"Europe needs a common regulatory system in this area."
"This will also be an important tool when it comes to fleet renewal."
"We are developing a climate-protection policy in many other areas and we need it here too, which means we need to adjust and adapt."
"Another important issue concerns research funding."
"The automobile industry needs more research money from the Member States."
"The growing number of mandatory targets, such as legislation on CO2 emissions, requires continuous adaptation on the part of the car industry."
"If Europe is to strengthen its position in this market, both the Member States and the European Union will have to invest far more in vehicle research, and not just in developing alternative drive systems but in other areas too, such as energy storage."
"We are already five to ten years behind our Asian competitors when it comes to research into storage battery technology."
"Now to the subject of CO2: in coordination with Chris Davies, the rapporteur for the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we have once again set out a number of central parameters."
"These are based on the concept of penalties instead of bans, with vehicle weight being a key parameter, but they are also centred on a realistic assessment of when the CO2 legislation can take effect."
"Parliament has decided that the target date should be 2015."
"We have also voted for the figure of 125 grams as the basic emission target."
"If I could now just make one comment to the Commission: the penalty that you have specified in your proposal is 15 times higher than that imposed on CO2 emissions from chimneys."
"This makes CO2 from vehicle exhausts 15 times more expensive than that which is emitted from chimneys."
"For this reason we require a realistic rating."
"What we have at present is too ambitious."
"I should like to express my thanks to those colleagues who helped put this report together."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the significance of CARS 21 extends far beyond the automotive sector."
"It is also the model for Europe's future industrial policy."
"Here for the first time, and by working closely with all the parties involved, we are attempting to reach joint agreement on a long-term, stable framework for the development of one of Europe's key industries."
"I am very proud to say that we have been successful in this."
"This is all based on a quite clear division of responsibilities."
"We told the European car manufacturers that they could not expect us to introduce protectionist measures in order to safeguard them from the growing competition coming from other parts of the world."
"We also said to them, however, that they could count on having a set of stable, reliable and predictable framework conditions and, more importantly, sufficient time - which is something Mr Chatzimarkakis just mentioned - in order to prepare themselves for the mandatory requirements to come."
"I should at this point just like to say something about the position of the European car industry: this is one of the very few market sectors in which Europe continues to be the undisputed global leader."
"It is a key industry for Europe, for technological development, for growth and, last but not least, for employment."
"I put up a vigorous defence against those voices in Europe who give the impression that there is something immoral, even criminal, in building, purchasing and driving motor cars."
"The car is part of our European way of life and it must be affordable, it must be safe, it must be reliable and it must be clean."
"This is precisely what CARS 21 is all about."
"The European car industry is not opposed to the ambitious environmental targets that the European Commission has put forward in its proposal."
"I should at this point also like to make something else quite clear: I am not against them either."
"The next stage in limiting CO2 emissions from private motor cars - with no ifs, ands or buts - will be to set a European average of 120 grams per kilometre."
"This is not inconsistent with the 125 grams mentioned by Mr Chatzimarkakis, because 5 grams of this is to be achieved through the use of bio-fuels."
"There is absolutely no disputing the fact that this will be our next target."
"I am also confident that the European car industry will benefit from such a legislator-driven innovation surge in that the sector will not only be producing the safest and best-quality vehicles but also the most environmentally-friendly cars in the world."
"I have not the slightest doubt that this will happen."
"In the course of the debate there were some suggestions made that I did not like at all, namely - and I will not put too fine a point on this - the attempt to pit manufacturers of large cars against those who build smaller vehicles, or to play off drivers of larger cars, those who can afford and wish to own such vehicles, against those who can only afford or prefer to drive smaller ones, the motto being: big car bad, small car good."
"The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, introduced a noteworthy argument into the debate when he wrote to the Commission President that the ability to spend a lot of money on a car - in other words to buy a big and expensive vehicle - did not entitle you to produce more pollution."
"This is certainly an argument worth reflecting on."
"I do not live in France but I know that in France there are people who live in large castles and who need a lot of energy to heat these buildings."
"I also know that in France there are people who live under the arches of bridges and who generate no heating costs whatsoever."
"Where is the difference?"
"If it is immoral to drive a large car and therefore to cause more pollution than someone who drives a small vehicle, then it is also immoral to live in a detached house and to generate more heating costs than someone who lives in a one-room apartment."
"I would just like to draw attention to the fact that while this argument may seem quite convincing at first glance, on closer inspection it would mean that the CO2 issue would, in a roundabout way, lead us down the road to pervasive lifestyle regulations in Europe."
"That is something we certainly do not want and the Commission does not want it either."
"We want to retain the entire range of models being produced by the European automotive industry and there is no reason why this should not be possible."
"I believe that in the consultation process that is about to commence we shall have to weigh up very carefully exactly what we can and want to ask of manufacturers, consumers and other road users."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have to say to you that we are expecting a very great deal of them."
"Everything that we have already agreed on by way of the Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards, which have already come into force, will make European motor cars much more expensive."
"The regulations that we will be introducing to give pedestrians better protection, in other words those measures directed towards vehicle design that will protect pedestrians more effectively in the event of their being involved in an accident, will also cost a great deal of money."
"The compulsory introduction of electronic stability control systems on European cars will be very expensive too, and on top of this there is the cost of CO2 reduction."
"We are doing this against the backdrop of a situation in which there is one particular sector of Europe's automotive industry that is under attack from international competitors, a sector that is already earning the least revenue, where export opportunities are declining and where imports are exceeding exports, namely the small and medium-sized vehicle market."
"I am quite concerned for the future of a large number of European manufacturers."
"I am fully convinced that it is absolutely vital for all industrial products, and this includes the motor car, to be taken to the maximum level of eco-friendly development that is technically feasible."
"However, I am not of the opinion that we should do this in such a way - and this applies to all industrial products, not just cars - that we compromise the international competitiveness of our industries."
"We have to be quite clear about one thing: if by our policies - and I say this with next week's debate very much in mind - we cause industries to abandon their European facilities and to set up production sites elsewhere in the world, the effect on the environment will certainly not be a positive one, for in these other places they will be then be producing their goods under much worse environmental conditions."
"If the steel manufacturers were to move out of Europe to Kazakhstan, believe me, in that country the rules are far less strict than here in Europe."
"The result would be an increase in emissions and at the same time tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of jobs would be lost."
"I would appreciate it if these points were not forgotten in the course of the impassioned debate to come."
"A modern European industrial policy and a modern European environmental policy can demonstrate that economy and ecology are not natural opposites, and that it is possible to solve the ecological challenges of the future by way of a rational economic approach combined with modern technology."
"This was the subject discussed by all those involved in CARS 21, which is being debated here today, and this was the ultimate outcome."
"I believe the result is one that deserves the broad support of the European public at large."
"(Applause)"
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Chatzimarkakis, I was responsible for drafting the relevant report for the INTA Committee."
"Here we essentially focused on three key aspects."
"First of all, we called on the Commission to ensure as a matter of urgency, and with due care and diligence, that all recommendations are examined to determine to what extent they impact on the multilateral stage - the so-called Doha Round - and on the bilateral agreements. These bilateral agreements were of special interest to us, as here in the case of Korea."
"However, we also focused attention on other countries such as India and the ASEAN states."
"It is important to ensure that market access is only opened up provided that we are also able to have appropriate guarantees from the other side."
"This relates especially to the so-called non-tariff trade barriers."
"Secondly, we wish to see greater coordination when it comes to setting international agreements and international standards."
"Thirdly, we would urgently recommend that when examining internal competition we do not lose sight of international competitive conditions, which have changed considerably in recent years."
"We now recognise that we have many more international competitors to deal with."
"Mr President, the automotive sector, which provides the European economy with a significant number of jobs, needs an ambitious framework that provides for coherent, integrated measures, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy, to cope with the new challenges."
"Our industry is the world's largest producer of cars and second largest producer of lorries, and it has good after-sales services. As such, it needs to assert its position and ensure that it is capable of meeting the mobility and transport requirements, increasing productivity, improving safety and benefiting the environment."
"To achieve this, economic efficiency is crucial."
"It is what is going to allow us to meet all of the objectives and guarantee affordable prices for fleet renewal, i.e. purchasing vehicles, and for maintaining them during their useful life."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has highlighted this aspect and expressed its support for efforts to improve competition and the protection of intellectual property rights, and to improve the tax treatment of the sector."
"These points are to a large extent incorporated in the report and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur."
"reporter of the opinion of the Employment and Social Committee. ?"
"(LT) I congratulate Mr Jorgo Chatzimarkakis for preparing this report."
"The car industry really is one of the most important ones."
"2.3 million people work directly in it and another 10-12 million in auxiliary sectors."
"This makes 7 percent of all the people working in the industrial sector of the Community."
"Members of the Community must take care of those people who could lose their jobs due to structural changes in advance and prepare for this appropriately."
"Currently, problems are solved only when they occur."
"We have to ensure that Community funds allocated for enterprises undergoing reconstruction directly reach the employees."
"Most especially, it is necessary to support those who want to start their own business - I have in mind the Globalisation Fund."
"Humanity is the most important when various changes take place and our responsibility is to take care of the Community's citizens, protect them from unemployment and effectively use social guarantees."
"Only this can help to gain the confidence of people."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to add to the debate by introducing two figures, so that we all know what we are talking about."
"There are now 700 million cars in the world at a time when oil prices are at 100 dollars."
"Last week Tata Motors brought out a cut-price motor car that averages five litres per hundred kilometres, but five litres is still a lot for such a small car."
"This all goes to show that in the years to come hundreds of millions of private cars will appear on the roads of the emergent nations - China, India, other Asian countries, South America and the African states."
"In the light of such a scenario, we are surely not planning to protect those European manufacturers who believe that they have to market two-tonne limousines with fuel consumption rates of seven, eight, ten litres or more, simply because we have a so-called competitive advantage in this area."
"I find the current debate to be nothing more than a fiasco."
"Mr Ferber of the CSU recently threatened Commission President Barroso that his CDU/CSU Group would not support a second mandate if Mr Barroso continued to back Mr Dimas in opposing the German automobile industry."
"Mr Verheugen, if you pardon my saying so, you surely cannot be cross with Mr Sarkozy."
"Why are you cross?"
"Because he and Mr Prodi wrote a letter that sought to ensure that the Commission would not set the growth curve at 80, as the German car industry wanted, but that a compromise would be found."
"I find what Mr Prodi and Mr Sarkozy did in relation to this debate to be absolutely and completely legitimate."
"Nor am I surprised that here again an FDP politician has naturally fallen into line behind the German car lobby."
"If I may say so, Mr Chatzimarkakis, your report falls behind what Chris Davies produced, because instead of footprint you are now giving priority to vehicle weight, and because instead of 125 grams based on vehicle technology you are now calling for an integrated target of 125 grams."
"This means that today Parliament has backtracked somewhat."
"As for the argument about a timeline, what are we doing there?"
"By setting the date 2012 we are only trying to bring more quickly to market technology that already exists."
"The most important element is missing: where is the target for 2020?"
"Mr Verheugen, you are calling for a solid framework."
"How should I, as a car-industry manager, know which direction to go in when Europe's policy-makers fail to set any terms of reference specifying how energy efficient I should be by 2020."
"There is no mention of this either in the Commission's proposal or in yours."
"If this Parliament is to do anything when it comes to the report on the legislation then it should produce a proposal on where we need to be by 2020."
"That is what we need: stable, long-term planning."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - Mr President, I want to start my speech by agreeing for once with Mr Turmes."
"This report is all about giving a crucial industry a stable framework within which to meet the societal demands that we are placing on it - whether they concern environment or safety."
"Whether Mr Dimas has achieved that and done a proper impact assessment in comparison with what is in the CARS 21 report, I beg to differ."
"One of the things I would like to ask Commissioner Verheugen to do is to take a message to Mr Dimas and ask him to explain how the process that he is currently using to develop this regulation is in any way compatible with what is in the CARS 21 proposal."
"I declare an interest in this because I was a member - a working member - of the High Level Group."
"This is the third report."
"The High Level Group made its report, the Commission made a very good response accepting most of the recommendations of the stakeholders and now this Parliament, thanks to the good work of Mr Chatzimarkakis, is going to convincingly endorse those conclusions."
"But there is one other group that characteristically is conspicuously missing from this debate, and that is the Member States."
"One of the most important recommendations of CARS 21 is an integrated approach."
"Member States have a major stake in this, so why are they not here this evening?"
"They are the ones who behave idiosyncratically in their national regulations and undermine the achievement of that stable framework, that internal market, that achievement of the environmental and safety goals that we want to achieve, those targets of reducing road deaths - where we have very ambitious targets and where they can make big investments in infrastructure and driver training."
"Why are they not here?"
"We need to send a clear message to them."
"One of the things that we ask from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is for this Parliament to take an initiative in getting other national parliamentarians together in this House to talk in the framework of CARS 21 about how they, as national and local politicians, are going to contribute to these overall goals of achieving a competitive car industry with the highest possible technology and preserving and developing jobs and employment, while achieving the goals that we all want to meet in terms of science, safety and environmental improvements."
"(Applause)"
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to include a few suggestions in the opinion on A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework in the 21st Century, given its high strategic value for growth and jobs in the Union, but also in view of the need to do more, by adapting vehicles and infrastructure and applying technological innovation, to make European roads safer."
"I believe that all of this can indeed be done by reducing emissions, but an integrated approach should have been pursued to this end, as proposed by the CARS 21 Group;"
"I do rather get the impression that the Commission has somewhat disregarded this approach."
"I particularly deplore the failure to emphasise the policies needed to attain the accepted cost-benefit principle."
"Furthermore, I note that, in order to achieve the aim of increasing the use of biofuels, it is vital to promote the necessary locally-based facility network enabling citizens to obtain supplies."
"Otherwise this aim will not be achieved."
"I will conclude by saying that I had hoped - and still hope - that judicious approaches will be taken to ensure that the cost of technological adaptation can be met on a level playing field guaranteeing free competition and genuine competitiveness within the EU."
"As a matter of fact, I have also drawn the attention of my fellow Members and the Commission to the importance of maintenance, but with little success."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs supports the CARS 21 initiative, which we believe was an exemplary example of stakeholder involvement."
"We say yes to the integrated approach, which we believe is fundamental to the success of this initiative."
"But, like Mr Harbour, I would raise the question about Member States' commitment, given their unilateral desire on occasion to legislate or implement fiscal regimes which undermine the integrated approach."
"Yes to simplification, replacing 38 directives with UN regulations - as long as we are not seen as abdicating our right to legislate should we need to - and yes to the development of technologically driven solutions such as ECOR."
"But I would hope that the Commission could take more action, as Ms Mann has suggested, on intellectual property rights, particularly in relation to China."
"We would like to see a proper implementation of the Regulation on Motor Vehicle Distribution in the EU and we believe it is fundamental to address non-harmonised implementation, the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive."
"We have to improve cross-border inspections of vehicles and cross-border enforcement of traffic rules in other Member States, because otherwise the whole situation becomes very disparate."
"But, like Mr Turmes, I believe that what we should be looking for is a framework which extends to 2020 and beyond."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen on having taken the initiative to create a high-level group, CARS 21, to examine the European automotive industry."
"In 2003 several Ministers for Industry, including myself, were in favour of this new method, which involves examining a given industrial sector in detail in order to find the appropriate solutions for it."
"You will recall that this method was successfully applied to the textiles sector, for example. It enables us to involve the stakeholders and to achieve an integrated approach."
"I have just one wish for the future: representation that gives greater consideration to the diversity of professions covered by the sector and even greater involvement of the European Parliament."
"That being said, I would like to mention three of the proposals put forward in the excellent report by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis."
"The first is the importance of stressing that the automotive sector is a source of jobs, competitiveness, growth and innovation and thus calling for greater investment in research and development, particularly in the areas of hydrogen motors, fuel cells or hybrids."
"The message is clear and research into vehicle technologies will certainly have to be one of the priorities of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology."
"Secondly, as regards the contribution of the automotive industry to the fight against global warming, the targets for the reduction of CO2 emissions are in line with the Davies report we adopted in October."
"We must give the industrial sectors time to prepare."
"As a result, I believe that it would not be wise to bring forward the 2015 deadline."
"Nonetheless, the fight against greenhouse gas emissions must also involve tax measures that act as an incentive for fleet renewal."
"Finally, I am pleased that our rapporteur calls for the creation of an internal market for custom and tuning parts and for greater efforts to combat the import of counterfeit spare parts."
"The safety of the citizens and the survival of thousands of European SMEs are at stake."
"In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to point out that it is essential to take into account the pressure on the European automotive industry and the ever-increasing competition."
"I would like to thank Mr Chatzimarkakis for his excellent collaboration with the shadow rapporteurs and congratulate him on having achieved this very dynamic result, which augurs well for this important sector of our economy."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, setting up the CARS 21 High Level Group was exactly the right thing to do."
"The results speak for themselves."
"We had two representatives of Parliament in this Group - Malcolm Harbour and Garrelt Duin - and they produced some very good work."
"As the shadow rapporteur for this report in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I only wish to deal with the environmental issues."
"However, as a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy too, I am firmly convinced that preserving and increasing the competitiveness of the European automotive industry is closely tied to the question of how eco-friendly and environmentally sustainable vehicles stamped 'made in Europe' will be in the future."
"I therefore welcome the fact that we were quick in implementing the Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards for motor cars and that the Commission proposal for a Euro 6 standard for goods vehicles has now been put forward."
"This source-based legislation will enable us to help the towns, cities and communities of Europe to meet the particulate emission targets that have been set and in this way to provide a better air quality."
"However, it remains a mystery to me that when it comes to emissions reduction people are always trying to postpone the 2012 deadline set for the introduction of the CO2 legislation and move it back to 2015."
"That is not right."
"We have had the Bali Climate Conference, where Europe put forward a very assertive front."
"However, when it comes to the actual legislation we always take a nifty step backwards."
"Car manufacturers have known since 1995 that something had to be done in the area of research and development to produce environment-friendly models."
"I think that a set-up time of 12 years would be sufficient to achieve the 120 g/km target by 2012, and this includes any complementary measures."
"That is something quite important."
"Climate change will certainly not wait for us, which means that we have to act now."
"It is also important to ensure that CO2 output will have peaked by the year 2015 so that we can then set about reducing these emissions."
"Here every industry will have to play its part, including the vehicle manufacturers."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the car industry should have reduced its emissions by a great deal more than it has, but we are where we are and it takes time to achieve change economically, so I welcome the rapporteur's proposal to set a target of 125 g by 2015, to bring it in line with the vote of this Parliament last October."
"I think it is ambitious, but it is achievable. And, to a significant degree, it now reflects the Commission's proposals for only a very gradual phase-in of penalties after 2012."
"But I am sorry that the rapporteur has proposed that the target values should be based on weight, because this removes an incentive to reduce the weight of cars and it goes counter to the vote we had in October."
"So, please, let us be consistent."
"In its proposals, the Commission has recognised that footprint may have great merit; it simply says that we have not got the data to establish the credentials for that yet, so let us get the data as fast as we can and keep the options open."
"We do not want to fight our business leaders and our entrepreneurs."
"On the contrary, if we are to combat climate change and reduce the threat that now hangs over the survival of billions of people in the poorest parts of this planet, we have to get them to accept responsibility for their actions."
"I was wrong in November when I claimed here that Michael O'Leary, the boss of Ryanair, had said that he did not give a toss for the environment so long as he could stuff his pockets and those of his airline full of gold."
"That may be the impression his scorn for environmentalists sometimes creates, but I apologise and withdraw the claim, and look forward to taking up his offer of a debate."
"But if we are to tackle the problem of climate change, we need people like Mr O'Leary and his counterparts in the car industry on side, working with us, pushing the boundaries of innovation and leading from the front."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that in this case the rapporteur has done a great deal of work and demonstrated considerable skill in how to negotiate and how to compromise."
"This concerns in particular the matter of emissions reduction in the automotive industry. We must be realistic and keep in mind that the industry belongs among the top industries in Europe and at the same time is one of the key employers."
"As mentioned earlier, the industry provides more than two and a quarter million jobs and millions more in related fields."
"In my opinion, reducing emissions in this industry will be a very difficult task."
"In my view, the result here is a respectable and realistic document."
"It is important, too, for it to support the endeavour to simplify significantly the legislation affecting the automotive industry: there are more than 200 regulations in existence today."
"In this vein, I have tried, in my role as shadow rapporteur, to support the report with my amendments."
"Their main objectives were to prevent the ambitious plans from tripping up the development of the field in Europe and our ability to compete in the world."
"(SK) Please allow me as an introduction to thank the rapporteur, Mr Chatzimarkakis, for his excellent report, which takes into consideration and pragmatically addresses all aspects of the regulatory framework, which are so important to the future of the automotive industry."
"When we talk in this report about the European automotive industry's ability to compete under the conditions of global development, we have to take into consideration, above all, those aspects that could significantly limit this ability."
"I thought originally that it was not necessary to remind the European Commission of the significance of this industry to the economic and social development of the European Union, but since the Commission came up with the proposal of setting emission standards for new private cars, I am no longer so sure."
"If that is correct, then the Commission would obviously pay more respect to the majority view of the European Parliament, as well as to the views of the expert groups who are advocating a more integrated approach."
"The European Parliament is also critically considering the time within which the European automotive industry is able to meet the technologically ambitious emissions targets such in a way that would have the minimum impact on the European industry's ability to compete."
"The European Parliament expressed this clearly in the report by Mr Davies and in this very report: by majority vote the committee expressed its belief that the car companies could reach the CO2 level of 125 g/km by 2015."
"If we really hope to reduce emissions throughout the automotive sector, we must have a more comprehensive understanding of these issues."
"The proposed step would definitely lead to a slowdown in the exchange of old cars, besides other negative impacts, such as the inability of less wealthy citizens to purchase new cars."
"This aspect would be most likely to prevail in the new Member States where the level of exchanging old cars for new is, for economic reasons, low."
"This certainly would not contribute to the reduction of CO2, quite the contrary."
"(NL) Mr President, transport emissions are responsible for a fifth of greenhouse gas emissions."
"The number of cars per thousand inhabitants is increasing fast all over the world, so cars really must become sustainable."
"However, this is a message that is scarcely to be heard in the response of the Commission to the CARS 21 report and in the report itself."
"The document speaks about making cars cleaner and the competitiveness of the automotive industry but it makes no connection between these two things, while it is obvious that sustainable and economical cars are the future."
"Indian and Chinese car manufacturers are sweeping the world with small, economical, clean and cheap cars."
"The European automotive industry meanwhile is fighting a rearguard action to be allowed to emit even more CO2."
"That is unfortunate for the environment but it is also unfortunate for employment in the European Union."
"The CARS 21 High Level Group was a missed opportunity to put in place a vision of a sustainable automotive industry, a vision that provides an answer to the real challenges."
"Innovation is the key word here."
"In the United States a hydrogen highway is being laid and the market is being prepared for electric vehicles."
"Where are the European initiatives?"
"Some car manufacturers have the prototypes ready, but there are still no hydrogen vehicles on the road."
"It is time for governments and industry to unite and work together in order to make rapid progress."
"Research alone is not enough."
"The setting-up of high level groups is an excellent idea in theory, but unfortunately CARS 21 was dominated by a conservative branch of industry."
"It is really important that the composition of high level groups does justice to the challenges we are facing."
"Millions of new cars are going to come on to the market over the next few years and it would really help if they were clean and economical."
"(DE) Mr President, car manufacturing is one of Europe's key industries."
"It employs some 12 million people, it represents innovation and growth and it produces something designed to provide individual mobility."
"It must therefore be our aim to see that the European car industry maintains its global leadership and its competitiveness."
"At the same time, however, we need to remember that in today's global economy there is a very fine line between incentives for innovation and penalties for economic actions, and that, at the end of the day, we are still exporting the best products in the world and not just outsourcing our production locations."
"I essentially want to focus on the CO2 issue, which is without doubt one of the most important aspects of the subject we are discussing here."
"Lifestyle criticism, which Mr Verheugen mentioned, has long been an unpleasant aspect of the European climate debate."
"It is very 'in' to criticise individual lifestyles."
"Claude Turmes has just done as much."
"The thing is, if we were to withdraw all the two-tonne limousines from the market, as he would dearly like to do, the CO2 reductions would scarcely be measurable, but the damage to the national economy would be enormous."
"Let me now comment on the proposed CO2 regulation that is currently on the table."
"Mr Verheugen has said quite clearly in this respect that he has no wish to introduce legislation that would constitute a lifestyle criticism."
"However, when I look at the penalty payments now being proposed for minimal deviations from the prescribed limits, I tend to be of the view that this is precisely what the Commission has done."
"In actual fact, the regulation that we are discussing and approving here today is hostile to innovation, for the money that the car manufacturers will have to pay out is needed for innovation and research."
"Mr President, the car of today is, in some ways, very much the same as that of 100 years ago but, at the same time, it is extremely different regarding security, efficiency and its effect on the environment."
"This proves one thing: the strength of competition develops technology at a pace we cannot imagine."
"It also underlines the need for Europe to have a competitive car industry if we are to contribute to the global agenda and to better standards for the environment in the global economy, because, if we do not, we will not be able to influence that development."
"Those who call for a policy that would decrease the competitiveness of the European car industry do not contribute to a better environment - it is important to state that."
"It is also important to state that the target of 125 g, as stated in the report, is acceptable and a step forward."
"But the important thing is not to discuss emissions from individual cars - big or small - because we need big cars and we will need small cars: they play a different role in different parts of our Union, in our countries."
"What we need is an overall development that decreases emissions in all sorts of cars."
"Therefore, it is important to support new cars, because they are better, to support better road systems, better transport systems, better fuels and better engines."
"That can only be done by a competitive European car industry and that can only be achieved if we have the right policies to balance the environment and competitiveness, and this report makes a good contribution towards that."
"(RO) First of all, I would like to extend my congratulations to the Rapporteur for the work done on this report."
"I consider this to be an extremely important debate."
"The European Union can have the most dynamic knowledge-based economy only if it invests enough in research and especially if the results can be integrated into industrial production."
"Climate change is one of the major challenges of the century."
"In major urban areas, traffic and pollution constitute a problem for 66% of European citizens, and 70% of the citizens expect the Union to show active involvement in dealing with these problems."
"The automotive industry should be capable of delivering less polluting products; however, the industry needs support in its research activities and it is especially important that any constraint should take into account the time required to develop new types of cars, from concept to design, manufacturing, testing and marketing."
"We should also take into consideration market demand and in particular the citizens' buying power."
"In this context, I believe that Member States should be encouraged to devise tax incentives for end-users, so as to encourage them to invest in greener cars."
"Such a system was introduced in Romania as early as 2003, with very good results."
"The development of the European automotive industry will lead to the preservation and creation of a significant number of jobs."
"(SV) Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for a good piece of work on an important and sensitive matter."
"We all know how important the car industry is in the EU."
"Our car industry, not least in my home country, is a leading contender in the fields of development, research, performance, the environment and safety."
"A successful car industry is important to the Union."
"We are talking about jobs and growth, but also about responsibility for our environment, for the global climate."
"The Commission proposes far-reaching legislation focused on compulsory reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from engine exhausts, improved vehicle technology and use of biofuels."
"The rapporteur has misgivings about targets which are so difficult for industry to attain that they can jeopardise the competitiveness of companies, but we have heard that before in this debate."
"I have also heard such arguments back home."
"I can understand and share those misgivings, but I believe that it would be unfortunate in this situation if Parliament were to lower the level of ambition."
"I am quite confident that the EU car industry can cope with targets set at high levels through research and development."
"It has demonstrated its ability to do so in the past."
"The people of our countries do not want to pay too much for their cars, but they also know that we must get to grips with climate change and that we need to act quickly."
"- (DA) Mr President, I should like to join the many Members who have thanked the rapporteur for the excellent report we are discussing here."
"It is clear that, given so many cars, the increasing mobility and an increasing desire to give even more people the opportunity to drive, the issue of emissions is a key problem that we shall have to address."
"Carbon dioxide is not toxic to humans in itself, and a little more CO2 in the atmosphere would actually make plants grow slightly faster."
"It is, however, ruinous to the climate, and so it is important that we do what we can to reduce CO2 emissions."
"In my opinion, we must place greater reliance on research, to enable us to develop engines that run at a significantly higher temperature than is currently the case - possibly using ceramic or other materials, and especially by means of a much more widespread use of software for control purposes."
"I believe that the objectives laid down will be easy to achieve."
"There is no reason to believe that, given a concentrated, targeted effort and substantial research resources, Europe should not be able to achieve the objectives it has set itself, and make itself the leading industry within the automotive sector that it already is."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Chatzimarkakis on his report as it urges the Commission to set ambitious yet realistic targets."
"It also follows some of the CARS 21 recommendations, such as the integrated approach to the reduction of CO2 emissions, the need to ensure appropriate lead-times and the protection of the internal and external competitiveness of the European industry."
"I would like to highlight a number of issues."
"The first of these is the fact that the road safety objectives are a key element and here, too, we need an integrated approach that incorporates vehicle technology improvements, infrastructure measures, and education and information."
"As regards trade, and in particular the negotiations with Korea, it is important to ensure that Korea abolishes the existing non-tariff barriers and does not create new ones."
"It is also essential to emphasis the crucial role played by the better regulation principles, i.e. proper impact assessments, the cost-effectiveness principle or appropriate lead-times, in creating a competitive regulatory framework for the automotive industry."
"In this respect, the roadmap is an integral part of the final CARS 21 report and should be respected."
"There are clearly some structural problems and, of course, it is necessary to establish general conditions to make the automotive industry in the EU sustainable."
"The only way to do that is to enable our industry to remain in the forefront of technological, ecological and social innovation with the support of a highly skilled labour force."
"Consequently, one very important aspect is the commitment to education and training for workers in the car industry."
"Community environmental, road safety, and energy efficiency legislation requires proper training for workers to enable them to adapt more easily to changes, both of a technical nature and as regards regulation, and to enjoy the same or better job prospects."
"In addition, in order to guarantee the future of the European automotive industry, it is crucial to strengthen in the Union the rights of workers and their trade unions to information and consultation."
"One example that illustrates this is the recent agreement between Ford and the General Workers' Union in the Valencia factory, which will allow new investment for modernisation and for the production of new models."
"Participation strengthens the sector, and in cases where restructuring is necessary can mitigate its negative effects."
"As a result, it is essential to emphasise the need to reinforce, with the corresponding revision, the Directive on the European Works Council."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteur, tomorrow in Brussels the 86th car showroom will open its doors and the environmentally-friendly car will take centre stage."
"It is clear that both the car manufacturers and consumers have finally been convinced of the urgent need for a change of course."
"It is also clear that a change of course and change of mentality will only be possible, will only be achievable, through compulsory measures, and this will require measures in a number of different areas."
"Anyone who is still thinking defensively is wrong, in my opinion."
"A significant number of European and other medium-sized cars already meet the new standard of 120 grams of CO2 per kilometre."
"Even German cars, Mr Verheugen: the new Golf TDI 1900 is already on 115 grams per kilometre, so it really is possible in Germany too, and I think that we have to vigorously pursue that route further."
"Environmentally-friendly technology: that is what it is about."
"It is a sector that has huge potential for growth and offers huge opportunities."
"It is good, therefore, that the Commission is forcing the issue."
"We need to invest now, as you have already said, Commissioner, in order to lead the world in this field."
"I have checked the figures: the Seventh Framework Programme contains over EUR 4 billion of loans for the transport sector."
"That is a great deal of money but in the view of Parliament - it is in Mr Chatzimarkakis's report - not enough to fulfil our high ambitions."
"That is why we are asking for more loans to be earmarked for research into new technologies at the budget review."
"In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, it is also high time that the Council moved more swiftly, especially in the tax field."
"There is a proposal before the Commission to couple vehicle tax to the emission of harmful substances."
"What are the national governments waiting for?"
"They are not represented here, unfortunately, but I hope that the message will get through to them."
"Why are the governments waiting to take action on this proposal?"
"It is the only way to really get the environmentally-friendly car adopted in the short term."
"(PL) Mr President, we are all fully aware that the European Union's car industry is one of the most important sectors of its economy, producing 19 million vehicles a year. Most importantly, it also accounts for 2.3 million jobs."
"A further 10 million jobs in associated sectors are indirectly dependent on this industry. It is worth noting that it is not only the quantity but probably essentially the quality of the jobs provided that accounts for the key role the car industry plays in the economic life of the European Union."
"The best way of illustrating this success is by reference to the EUR 35 billion annual export trade surplus and the high level of innovation."
"Despite all this optimistic data, the European car industry is facing some very serious challenges."
"I fully support the final report of the CARS 21 High Level Group and the European Commission's communication on the subject."
"Nonetheless, I should like to call for further action aimed at creating a genuine single internal market in cars."
"Individual Member States are still applying different tax regimes concerning cars, either by charging duty or through other registration charges, perpetuating the inequalities between consumers."
"I welcomed the compromise achieved in the European Parliament concerning the so-called 'repair clause', because it most certainly represents a step towards unifying provisions in this area, thus contributing to better law-making."
"The car industry should be relieved of unnecessary bureaucratic burdens, especially as regards increasing the number of international provisions already in existence."
"Pursuant to the principles of better law-making, a proper impact assessment and the principle of optimising costs and benefits should always be taken into account when creating a competitive legal environment for the car industry."
"In view of the ongoing technological development in this sector, I support the Commission's action introducing a review and revision mechanism to ensure that legal provisions do not slow down the technical advances that are constantly being achieved."
"The European car industry is one of the most competitive of its kind in the world. Nonetheless, its position may be threatened if its competitors resort to unfair trading practices or fail to respect intellectual property rights."
"I should like to call on the Commission to take more consistent and effective action to ensure respect for intellectual property rights and their implementation in all parts of the world, notably China."
"The importance of the strategic partnership with China is beyond dispute, but European intellectual property has to be protected. This is absolutely vital."
"(NL) Mr President, I think that the frantic attempts of the auto lobby to get absolutely essential environmental measures postponed have been successful."
"Time after time members of this Chamber appear to be susceptible to this lobby: first Mr Davies and now Mr Chatzimarkakis."
"Waiting until 2015 to substantially reduce CO2 emissions from vehicles is highly irresponsible."
"What is more, it is technically possible to achieve 120 grams per kilometre by 2012, and the automotive industry itself is solely to blame for the present situation."
"After all, attempts to reduce emissions voluntarily have failed miserably."
"It turns out that only setting compulsory standards will work."
"We expect the citizens of Europe to make sacrifices to save our climate."
"Why should we not demand as much of the automotive industry?"
"Thus there must be a maximum 120 grams of CO2 emissions per kilometre by 2012."
"(DE) Mr President, I wanted to direct a further question to Mr Verheugen."
"Mr Verheugen, in your speech you said that the rules that we are now laying down for the car industry would as good as mean the relocation of European industry."
"You repeatedly referred to the pressure being applied to the European automotive industry."
"Could you perhaps subsequently make it clear in your presentation that the regulations that we are introducing will of course apply equally to all motor manufacturers worldwide?"
"This naturally means that the Japanese car industry will also have to comply with these rules."
"Moreover, in this respect let me just add a further comment: last week you presented us with the 'lead market initiatives'."
"Does this not then mean that in the car manufacturing sector in particular we are positioning Europe as the market that now has the most demanding legislation and that we are therefore specifically creating a lead market for efficient motor cars, even allowing for environmental constraints and oil supply problems?"
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to respond immediately to the question from Mr Turmes."
"My comment had nothing whatsoever to do with the car industry but was one of principle on the connection between industrial policy and environmental policy, between economy and ecology."
"You will of course be aware of my viewpoint: we in Europe have to set the highest standards."
"However, it makes no sense to run so far ahead of things that industry migrates away and we begin to export pollution and, as a result, import unemployment."
"These remarks were not related in any way to the car industry."
"There I fully share your view that we not only have the opportunity, but also the obligation, to establish Europe permanently as the lead market for environmentally-friendly cars."
"As I now have the floor I would like to point something out to Mrs Corbey: it is not correct to assert that the Chinese are building cars that are more environmentally friendly than those made in Europe and that these are now flooding the European market in their millions."
"The few hundred Chinese cars that are currently to be found in Europe are of extremely dubious quality, not exclusively but also from an environmental viewpoint."
"The same can be said for the people's car, the Tata, that is now being manufactured in India."
"If you relate the weight of these vehicles to their fuel consumption you will see that their performance is significantly worse than that of the cars currently being built in Europe."
"The same applies to the US: it is now quite unrealistic to make the accusation that American cars are more environmentally friendly than European ones."
"If you think about it for just a moment you will soon come to the conclusion that this cannot be true."
"When it comes to modern technology, the only working hydrogen-powered cars in the world are to be found in Europe."
"Nobody else is spending more on research in this area than we are."
"I would like to close with a thought that will perhaps unite us all: I am able to remain quite composed throughout this entire debate for I really do believe that we are on the right road, because I know that the European car manufacturers and, more importantly, the European automotive suppliers - for they really are the driving force behind European industry - have not been asleep in recent years but have been working on a whole series of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to achieve our objectives."
"Mr Turmes, you are perfectly correct and I would have been happy to support such a proposal: the industry would be delighted - and so would I as the Commissioner responsible for industry - if we could now say what the next stage in the process should be."
"This is precisely what we have set out in CARS 21, namely a long-term, stable and predictable regulatory framework."
"This can be as ambitious as possible provided that it is long term and provided it is stable."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking my fellow Members for this truly fair and open debate."
"It has been conducted on a high level and has covered the issues of climate protection, innovation and - as we have been aware of at all times, especially when it comes to our fellow Members from the GUE/NGL - job security."
"These are three areas where we all have to find common agreement."
"I should also like to express my thanks to Claude Turmes for his various clarifications and suggestions."
"However, I would like to say quite openly that I consider the remarks made by Mrs Liotard to be unfair."
"It is not all about running after some lobby group or other. It is about fighting fervently for a policy that represents a key market for us in Europe."
"Here I am fully behind the Commissioner and I am also fully behind you too, Claude."
"I would maintain that you have been unfair here, Mrs Liotard."
"It is not right that you should call this lobbyism."
"I would at this point just like to quote from the great German sociologist Max Weber, who said that politicians must have passion - and I am actually trying to show some of this now - but at the same time they must have a sense of responsibility and a sense of proportion."
"The latter sometimes seems to get lost in debates of this kind with all the hysteria about climate change."
"Keeping a sense of proportion means ensuring that the great objectives that we want to achieve are also feasible."
"I would now just like to mention my colleague Chris Davies, for I am just a little proud of him."
"There is no one in the ALDE Group who is greener or more ecologically minded than Chris Davies."
"Nonetheless, he has had the sense of proportion in his report to call for practical limits and deadlines."
"That is what all this is about: we should not be giving the people of Europe the run-around, but should be doing things that are really achievable."
"I am pleased to see that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by a large majority."
"I also want to thank the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for having adopted this report by a fairly large majority and I hope that tomorrow many of the Members will vote for it here in this House."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing - (HU) As People's Party shadow rapporteur on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would like to emphasise that the report does not deal with the car of the twenty first century but regulations for a competitive automotive industry in the twenty first century."
"By now motor traffic has become the second largest CO2 emitting sector and is responsible for 12% of all the CO2 emissions throughout the Union."
"The rate of increase is alarming, for this sector increased 26% between 1990 and 2004, making it 26.5% of the Union's total energy consumption."
"The car manufacturers' voluntary agreements on emissions reduction are not working, and the Union's regulations are powerless, since they can only bring the vehicle sector into the Emissions Trading Scheme after 2013, if at all."
"The only 'success' is that the average consumption by cars was 12.4% less in 2004 than in 1995."
"This is entirely due to technological innovation as cars have been continuously increasing in size and power."
"Both the Member States and car buyers have to make further efforts."
"There have to be, on the one hand, tax incentives for fuel-efficient and low CO2 emission vehicles to gain a market presence and support for manufacturers for targeted development."
"On the other hand, we have to improve the information available to purchasers, update and extend the labelling system for light trucks, harmonise energy efficiency classes and propose annual running costs."
"Finally, we have to sell the idea of eco-driving and training, run attention-grabbing campaigns and adopt regulations for obtaining a driving licence."
"Tax treatment of losses in cross-border situations (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Kauppi, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the tax treatment of losses in cross-border situations."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to start by emphasising what my report, which is being debated today, is essentially about."
"While the report is nominally about taxation, the real issue at stake here is the proper functioning of the internal market of the EU."
"The global economy is developing in a way that puts an increasing amount of pressure on Europe to maintain its competitiveness, a fact that has been underlined and widely agreed upon in various instances, notably in the Lisbon Strategy and its revisions."
"We must be proactive in rising to the challenge and I believe that a fully-functioning single market is the first priority in achieving this."
"In addition to the freedom of movement of goods, people and services, this implies, crucially, a level playing field for European companies to establish business in any location in Europe as if it were a single country, a home market - a genuine home market - where decisions are based according to a real economic advantage, not a distorted one created by red tape."
"Obstacles to this freedom do not only lead to suboptimal economic choices but also prevent European businesses from expanding."
"The fact that some such obstacles still remain is regrettable, as a Europe-wide home market is a stepping stone to growth for European businesses and a precondition for creating more European world leaders."
"Cross-border consolidation of losses - the subject of this report - is a step towards such a working home market."
"Currently, in this respect, the tax treatment of a group operating within a single Member State is heavily preferential compared to a cross-border situation."
"Within a single Member State a company can usually offset losses incurred by its branches and subsidiaries in the taxation of the parent company."
"However, in the case of branches and subsidiaries in other Member States, the national legislation varies considerably."
"In most cases, if consolidation of losses for tax purposes within the same group is possible, it is nevertheless granted with considerable and varying delays."
"This discrepancy has grave consequences for the proper functioning of the internal market."
"It distorts investment decisions, constituting a barrier to entering some markets while tending to unfairly favour the large markets where losses can more easily be absorbed."
"It particularly hampers the SMEs' capacity to expand, as they frequently incur start-up losses that they cannot immediately absorb - even the time factor is very relevant to SMEs."
"The existence of differing Member State legislation obviously also increases compliance costs, ill afforded by SMEs and conducive to tax engineering with larger companies."
"Finally, delays in loss relief are understandably costly and burdensome to all European companies."
"There is a considerable cost burden involved when capital that is legitimately recoverable is tied up, often for years, because the current national loss relief legislation will not allow consolidation without delays."
"The report promotes a remedy to this by promoting the possibility to offset losses in the same tax year, which would transfer the unreasonable time burden away from the company and to the public sector."
"It would also level the playing field, at the same time lowering companies' compliance costs."
"It would also mean that the tax domain is one where there is still work to be done to make the most of the internal market."
"This does not imply harmonising tax rates, rather that tax competition is a healthy feature of the European economy."
"However, it does mean legislating to facilitate cross-border business, to establish a level playing field where investments are based on undistorted economic benefits."
"I therefore welcome the Commission's activities in this area in promoting cross-border loss relief measures."
"I would like to see Parliament support this urgently needed legislation, and I am grateful for the messages of support we have received during the process."
"I think that Parliament's opinion on the question will also be very timely because the European Court of Justice has called for political guidance on the issue as well."
"I would further like to encourage the Commission to push ahead with the CCTB as a longer-term solution, which I hope will also be supported by this House in this report."
"However, the CCTB is a long-term project, the realisation of which lies far in the future."
"In the mean time, cross-border laws, relief and consolidation of losses are urgently needed as an intermediate remedy to some serious problems encountered within the functioning of the internal market."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, some weeks ago, as you remember, we discussed the contribution of taxation and customs policies to the Lisbon Strategy of growth, jobs and competitiveness."
"Cross-border loss relief is one key element for establishing a competitive internal market without obstacles and thus contributing to growth and employment."
"Let me explain the importance of granting cross-border loss relief for the internal market."
"Imagine a small or medium-sized enterprise which is operating successfully in its domestic market."
"Once it plans to expand its operation to other Member States, to the internal market, it will not only run into problems regarding additional compliance costs."
"Thus, in many cases, this SME will not be able to set off any start-up losses against profits which it may continue to generate in its Member State of residence."
"The non-consideration of foreign losses results in double taxation and discourages many SMEs from investing in other Member States."
"With the new initiative on cross-border loss relief, large enterprises - but also SMEs in particular - could more easily extend their activities abroad and enjoy the full benefits of the internal market."
"The initiative on cross-border loss relief constitutes a targeted solution in the short to medium term and represents an intermediary step."
"But please note that this initiative could in the future be complementary to the common consolidated corporate tax base (CCTB), notably for companies that are not covered by the CCTB."
"The initiative on cross-border loss relief is more limited in scope than the consolidation of the tax base under the CCTB would be, as this provides automatic and comprehensive off-setting of all profits and losses within a group of companies."
"I highly appreciate the strong support expressed in Ms Kauppi's report for the Commission's initiative in the field of cross-border loss relief, for the coordination approach and of course also for our work on the CCTB."
"Like you, I am persuaded that we should continue our efforts to dismantle tax barriers in the internal market."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE group - (HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner and Mrs Kauppi for this report."
"They have dealt with an important issue eliciting sensitive and contrasting emotions."
"Two comments."
"On the one hand, I feel it is important that from the standpoint of the internal market there should be no danger that a parent company and a subsidiary are at a disadvantage simply because they are operating in two different Member States, compared with companies operating in only one Member State."
"So I urge that double taxation is ruled out, as the Commissioner has said, perhaps through the mechanism of electronic cooperation."
"Given time factors, we could encourage efficient cross-border activity by the economic players and employ credit and exemption methods."
"At the same time I feel we must be concerned when a subsidiary makes a profit and a parent company makes a loss."
"Mrs Kauppi, in the new Member States, for example, this is of more interest from our point of view."
"My second point about scrapping double taxation concerns the common consolidated tax base."
"We still have to debate this but I have reservations."
"I do not want to champion tax sovereignty but I cannot yet see clearly the effect of the common consolidated tax base."
"I am also fearful that there will be a lot of political pressure for a minimum level, just as with VAT or income tax."
"The proposals suggested by the Socialist and Communist, and perhaps the left-wing representatives too, demonstrate this, although the Maastricht criteria, I believe, put a stop to this."
"But my fear here is that I do not know what the effect will be on the new capital-poor eastern European Members in the light of the flow of capital in the internal market."
"Where will the administration be?"
"And will it be possible to keep individual tax concessions to counterbalance a disadvantageous infrastructure situation?"
"For these reasons I will abstain from these sections but I wish to thank the Commissioner and the rapporteur again. Thank you, Mr President."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution that we are to vote on tomorrow is symptomatic of the need for a fiscal policy at EU level."
"This does not mean emasculating or curbing national tax policies; no one doubts the competence of individual Member States in this field."
"It does however mean flanking and coordinating them, especially when, as in the case of corporate losses in cross-border situations, merger and relocation decisions taken by companies within and outside of Europe transcend national borders."
"Clearly, not only national regulations but also bilateral agreements are insufficient, given that in this age of globalised financial markets and globalised production such phenomena occur in large numbers and exceed the confines of individual countries."
"The content of the motion is the result of a consensus on many points and I shall just recall the main ones, with heartfelt thanks to the rapporteur for her constant willingness to cooperate."
"Twenty-seven different tax systems hamper the smooth operation of the internal market and constitute an obstacle for businesses, especially small ones, as Commissioner Kovács has said."
"The first assertion made in the text is self-evident, expressing the gravest concern over the negative impact that the different treatment of cross-border losses by Member States has on the functioning of the internal market."
"The proposed solution is still transitional and temporary because the only perfect solution is a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB)."
"That is why we support the Commission communication as an important step in addressing the situation, while calling for adequate coordination among Member States as regards timing and solutions: I am quoting from paragraph 4."
"It is important to have recalled the existence of common European institutions such as the 'European company' and the 'European cooperative society', as well as EU procedures concerning Community-scale groups of undertakings."
"These must be built upon, because they enable us not only to evoke the link with industrial relations, and hence the effects on employment, but also to acknowledge the formation of Community-scale groups of undertakings that are stable."
"After all, what we aim to foster is the development and implantation of a system of production with Europe, and not the individual Member State, at its heart, a system of production that does not follow the siren voices and decide tactically to diversify into other countries on the grounds of tax advantages, offsetting charges and losses wherever convenient."
"The production system must be able to rely on equal treatment and avoid differential accounting according to whether the controlling undertaking is based in just one country or has a presence in various countries."
"This result cannot be achieved without appropriate rules and uniform conditions."
"Acknowledging that profitable tax competition would fundamentally undermine the content of this proposal does not amount to waving an ideological flag in opposition to it."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SV) Thanks to Piia-Noora Kauppi for a good report."
"She gives a balanced account of the problems and difficulties which arise on the internal market when we have 27 different tax systems."
"Globalisation, which has been mentioned, has after all increased still further the need for a common approach to tax matters in the EU so that obstacles to competition can be avoided."
"Different rules and bureaucracy also mean a loss of economic strength to companies and a loss of jobs in the EU."
"We need clearer rules and an approach which favours enterprise, such as Mrs Kauppi proposes."
"Perhaps some of us also need to remove the blinkers from our eyes."
"Taxes, as we know, are a very sensitive subject."
"The keywords here are tax competition and freedom of countries to determine their tax rates."
"The long-term goal of the Commission is to achieve a consolidated corporate tax base."
"As this is not attainable, targeted measures should be pursued within those areas which are conducive to effectiveness in the internal market."
"The report reviews various possibilities for action and shows how individual countries have chosen different approaches, which is good but not enough."
"It is in principle also reasonable for businesses to offset losses across frontiers within a company or between companies in a consortium."
"In order to facilitate such an arrangement a common approach is needed to what has to be taxed, in other words a consolidated corporate tax base."
"We in the ALDE Group think that this is the right way to go."
"Introduction of the common CCTB will not in itself prevent tax competition, rather the contrary."
"The tax base will be common, and transparency will be better."
"This new system will improve the possibilities for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular to offset their losses."
"Worried finance ministers - and there are many - can rest assured."
"Your power to tax will stay in place."
"Regarding Amendment 1, our Group would like a split vote the first part of which can deal with excise duties separately."
"As regards the rest, we are inclined to abstain in the vote on Donata Gottardi's amendment to recitals E and F in order to facilitate a broad consensus and broad support in the House for this excellent report."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the rapporteur deserves credit for her work, but this is a controversial report."
"We shall be voting against it and I shall now explain why."
"This is an attempt to unify tax regimes within the Union, and to impose tax solutions on the Member States."
"Furthermore, it also amounts to favouring cross-border companies over SMEs, and that would in turn oblige many domestic companies to set up branches and subsidiaries in other countries with no economic justification, simply to benefit from the provisions applying to cross-border companies."
"I would just like to point out that for many years cross-border companies took advantage of the lack of qualifications and corruption of officials in the post-Communist countries, resorting to tax and accounting fiddles to declare losses and avoid paying tax."
"The Union condoned this."
"The new provision would allow such behaviour to continue and put it on a legal footing."
"I am particularly surprised because there would be negative consequences for the countries of the old Union, as their taxes would be reduced."
"I believe it is necessary first to resolve the problem of tax and accounting fiddles by cross-border firms within the Union and improve the fiscal apparatus, especially in the new Member States."
"This would assist in the prevention and detection of tax offences."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can to some extent agree on one thing: the present situation in the EU, where there are 27 different tax systems operating alongside one another in an integrated single market with completely free movement of capital, is fatally flawed."
"This is where unity really comes to an end."
"Tax competition is tax dumping for the rich and the powerful and only imposes a greater tax burden on the shoulders of normal earners and consumers."
"It is hardly surprising that this situation is particularly pleasing to the property owners and big companies."
"What is really astonishing and alarming, however, is that this reality is still being talked up here in this House, which should really be representing the interests of more than just the elite few."
"In spite of all its nuances and nuanced assessments, the Kauppi report is still just a typical piece of spin."
"That goes for the position being adopted on the alleged positive impact of tax competition just as much as for the manner in which it deals with the actual subject matter, namely the tax treatment of losses in cross-border situations."
"It is an open secret that companies regularly use cross-border loss relief to reduce their tax bill by moving their profits to low-tax zones and low-tax countries."
"They are very successful in doing this, as the statistics show: such virtual loss offsetting has in fact meant that over the last 20 years the amount of tax paid on the profits made by the multinationals has fallen continuously."
"The rulings of the European Court of Justice have only served to make this tax arrangement easier and have therefore intruded massively into the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States."
"All this simply fuels the race to dump corporate tax."
"Those who support this development clearly want to see a Europe in which untold wealth is able to accumulate at the top of the pile, while down at the bottom poverty levels increase and the former middle classes have to survive on incomes that are falling in real terms."
"We want to see a different Europe and we want a socially just taxation policy."
"For this reason our Group will be rejecting the present report."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the rapporteur claims that this initiative will encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to expand their cross-border business."
"But I have little doubt that it has been heavily promoted by the large multinationals, because it is they that stand to benefit most."
"In my country, in Britain, the vast majority of businesses are small, and they provide for some 70% of employment."
"Only a tiny proportion of these have any interest in foreign operations."
"But my main objection is that it is more meddling by the European Union in taxation matters."
"Judging by the EU's record of value added tax, there will be endless changes to the law."
"We have had eight directives on VAT so far, and it is still a mess and prone to fraud."
"Businesses operate best when there are simple, well understood rules, as Mr Schmidt has just said."
"The EU knows how to do only one thing, and it does it to perfection. And that is to make things complicated."
"So, contrary to the views of other Members, a much better plan would be to encourage tax competition."
"Then those nations that have the lightest and simplest taxes will attract the most businesses."
"(PT) Mr President, the different treatment of losses by the various Member States distorts competition in the internal market, is unfair and encourages poor fiscal practice."
"We therefore welcome the Commission's initiative to propose a minimum level of harmonisation of these rules and hope that the Council will agree with this proposal."
"This is an area in which better regulation is essential, particularly to eliminate the associated legal uncertainty, which has resulted in repeated recourse to the Court of Justice of the European Communities and which has contributed to increased uncertainty in economic relations, thereby harming companies and SMEs."
"It is absolutely essential to ensure that the various fiscal practices are compatible with the effective functioning of the internal market."
"The quality of the report prepared by the rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi, has enabled a broad consensus to be reached among the main political groups on its fundamental elements."
"However, certain non-essential aspects of the report, in its initial version, may hinder this agreement."
"In particular, in the Socialist Group's opinion, this process is not compatible with the open defence of tax competition practices."
"These practices encourage artificial movements of companies, capital and persons."
"Such movements frequently result in signs of breakdown both socially and environmentally and in the productive fabric."
"Furthermore, in some economies, tax competition causes severe problems for the macroeconomic balance with varying consequences, particularly in terms of the level of quality and quantity of public property made available by these countries to their citizens."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament believes that, on a subject of such strategic importance, it would be highly advantageous to present to the Commission and Council a European Parliament position with a broad basis of support."
"In the area of this initiative, the European Union still has a long way to go, particularly in terms of creating the oft-mentioned CCCTB or Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base."
"We must create the political conditions for this future work."
"Agreement on this report is within our reach."
"We hope that, when it comes to the final vote, the spirit of compromise among the main political groups will enable the consensus reached on its main messages to be maintained so that there is broad final approval."
"Those secondary aspects that divide us politically to an extent that is not insurmountable must not be allowed to prevent this approval."
"We welcome the active involvement in this process of various members of the PPE-DE Group in particular, including its rapporteur, their spirit of compromise and their spirit of openness, which have enabled a consensus to be reached on the fundamental issues of this report. Thank you, Mr President."
"(LT) I would like to draw your attention to something that we talk very much about, the various shortcomings of the internal market, and emphasize the fact that the development of the internal market gives us many advantages."
"This document is important from the aspect of giving advantages to improve the labour productivity of enterprises working in the single market."
"However another aspect should not be forgotten."
"I represent a country where the majority of enterprises belong to European multinationals; they are not national."
"Therefore, sometimes it is very difficult for us to control our economy in the macroeconomic sense as corporate strategies put the aims of the national economy, such as the fiscal balance, etc., into the shade. We need to find an appropriate compromise between the advantages of the development of the internal market and macroeconomic stability."
"I would like to draw the commissioner's attention to the need to coordinate politics with economic issues and with Mr Almunia once again."
"(PL) Mr President, as I take the floor in this debate on tax treatment of losses in cross-border disputes, I should like to highlight the following issues."
"Firstly, direct taxation, such as corporate tax, does not fall within the competence of the European Commission."
"As a matter of principle, therefore, the Commission should not concern itself with it."
"Secondly, I am surprised to see that the report contains statements disapproving of the reductions in corporate income tax rates introduced in certain Member States, notably new ones."
"Thirdly, I am worried by the Commission's call for work on the introduction of a consolidated corporate tax base within the European Union to be speeded up."
"The nature of such a tax, its rate and setting the tax base are some of the very few instruments that still remain within the remit of the Member States and can be used to accelerate the economic development of less developed countries."
"Fourthly, a study of the Commission's proposals for a consolidated corporate tax base suggests that the aim is to ensure all Member States develop at a rate involving at most a 2% rise in GDP per annum. In such a scenario, how would the new Member States that are 20 or 30 years behind the more developed ones ever manage to catch up?"
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the issue of taxation and the possibility of transferring losses for cross-border business groups within the European Union cannot be tackled purely and simply on the basis of facilitating the cross-border operation of businesses."
"This objective is, of course, important for the smooth operation of the internal market, but when it is a matter of taxing a business, as mentioned in Mrs Kauppi's report, which we are considering today, then it should be placed within the wider context of the debate about greater harmonisation of taxation within the European Union."
"Provided that taxation competition does not exist on equal terms and there is no minimum requisite agreement on a common, unified tax base for companies so as to put in place uniform, transparent rules for measuring the tax base, the provision of opportunities such as this regarding tax relief for losses of a cross-border nature at present demands that we adopt a cautious approach. This is because it involves the serious risk of distorting the Member States' taxation and revenue systems, as well as the very operation of the internal market and of competition between businesses."
"Mr President, with this new form of debate I could of course use this minute to ask the Commissioner what the current state of play is concerning CCCTB in the Council, because we know that some Ministers of Finance are not very happy."
"Could you please, Mr Commissioner, tell us how the debate is going on within the Council and what the 27 Member States are proposing today?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I have followed the debate with great interest, and it has confirmed my conviction that the introduction of cross-border loss relief is an important factor for the deepening of the internal market."
"I fully share the views of Ms Kauppi that on the surface it is about taxation, but in reality it is about the proper functioning of the internal market."
"I am particularly grateful for your support with facilitating, in particular, the cross-border economic activities of the SMEs, which is very close to my heart."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Kauppi, for the very encouraging report, as well as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs for their support."
"The Commission can agree with most of the conclusions."
"The support of Parliament is welcome as a factor which may have a positive impact on the subsequent discussion in the Council."
"As suggested in the report, I can assure you that we are continuing efforts on the CCCTB and on the coordination of Member States' direct tax systems."
"The CCCTB is also very close to my heart, and the reason is that I am absolutely certain that it would be of greater relative benefit to the small and medium-sized enterprises than the big multinationals."
"However, I understand the concerns, and to respond to the question at the end of the debate, I want to tell you that in the Council it is on the table, but not as a concrete proposal."
"For the time being it is on the table as a concept, and as far as the concept is concerned, some two thirds of Member States expressed their support and less than one third expressed either doubts or opposition."
"Any discussion, particularly discussion which would prejudice the current debate on the cross-border loss relief issue, would be premature because there is, for the time being, no concrete legislative proposal."
"In the legislative work programme of the Commission, however, there is one point which states that, in the second half of the year, we will present a concrete legislative proposal - with the necessary impact assessment - on the CCCTB."
"Then we can discuss whether the concerns are relevant or not."
"One more point: if there is no unanimous agreement - and for the time being I believe that there will be no unanimous agreement - we can resort to enhanced cooperation as a solution."
"And, even in those countries that chose the CCCTB, no companies would be forced to use it, because there would be no sense in forcing companies that are not operating in the internal market - that are not doing business in the internal market - to use this common tax base."
"They can stay with the domestic national base used previously."
"So I share your conclusion that, in order to promote coherent development and the proper functioning of the internal market, obstacles deriving from the existence of different company tax regimes in the Member States must be tackled, preferably through common approaches and coordinated actions."
"With regard to the loss offset, your report highlights several specific areas where more work needs to be done, such as addressing the particular needs of SMEs, the definition of groups and the scope for automatic information exchange."
"My services will study these suggestions and comments and, where possible, bring the issues forward."
"The SME aspect is already an important part of the work of Vice-President Günter Verheugen."
"Another aspect, the definition of groups of companies, is an essential element of the work on the CCCTB."
"I can also assure you that your recommendations for cross-border loss relief within companies and groups of companies will orient our work in the coming months."
"There are several references in your report to tax avoidance."
"Here it may be noted that, last December, the Commission adopted a communication on the application of anti-abuse measures in the area of direct taxation."
"The Commission shares the concerns about tax avoidance expressed in your report."
"Member States need to be able to prevent their tax bases from being eroded because of abuse and aggressive tax planning."
"At the same time it is vital to ensure that there will be no undue restrictions to the Treaty freedoms."
"By launching this latest initiative, the Commission seeks to prompt further discussions with the other institutions on how national anti-abuse measures can meet those requirements."
"Your observations on tax avoidance risk will be taken into consideration."
"Finally, as regards the proposed amendments to the report, the Commission would advise against amendments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, but it could support amendments 7 and 8, which are in line with the spirit of the communication."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I will be very brief."
"I am of course happy to note that most of the groups are going to support the report tomorrow in the vote."
"My group has suggested abstaining with regard to Amendments 7 and 8."
"I think that it is in line with the Commission's recommendations as well that 7 and 8 will probably be adopted and that means that we have a very large majority backing the report tomorrow."
"I also would like to remember a little bit the past: how difficult it was before we accepted the first company taxation directives - a Parent-Subsidiary Directive and an Interest and Royalties Directive in the 1990s - to speak about these items."
"But they are now there after serious discussion, and I still believe that we can have all the practical things, like anti-abusive measures, that we can improve the Parent-Subsidiary Directive and that we can improve the workings of the Transfer Pricing Forum, and such initiatives are very much needed."
"But, in the end, we need a very large solution and CCCTB."
"At this time it is the best available option and we must take it seriously."
"I hope that it will be done during this European Parliament term, before the 2009 elections."
"Something must be done before the 2009 elections and we cannot afford to wait for Member States to come up with their ratifications and referendums."
"We must act now and before the time is up for this Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions (debate)"
"The next item is the report (A6-0513) by Mr Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation No 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions, in implementation of Article 79(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and the Council on the hygiene of foodstuffs - Transport aspects - C6-0086/2007 -."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I could in fact repeat much of what has already been said by Commissioner Verheugen but shall avoid doing so."
"This is a commendable initiative: small-scale measures often conceal major results, and this is one such case."
"We are obviously dealing here with rules that were enacted in a different Europe."
"The basic Regulation dates back to 1960, when our countries were separate, and when rules on hygiene and food could mask discrimination and obstacles to competition."
"That is why it was necessary to indicate which road to take and where to cross borders."
"Many things needed to be said, and many details spelled out, but since much of this no longer serves any purpose it is a good idea for us to divest ourselves of these rules and adapt them."
"We are aware that all food hygiene legislation is a sensitive matter and therefore very time-consuming."
"That is the reason behind this solution, which I think makes a good deal of sense, namely to separate out the transport rules, which are easier to accept and, I hope, to implement."
"The committee, which I have the honour of chairing, accepted my report unanimously."
"I take this as an encouraging sign that the House will do likewise tomorrow, enabling appropriate steps to be taken in the very near future."
"This is a case of virtuous simplification."
"It is simplification which, at the same time as simplifying, adapts to current circumstances and new ways of conveying information, rendering many bureaucratic procedures unnecessary and perhaps enabling us to devote more of our attention to making sure that food is transported hygienically from one part of the Union to another."
"on behalf of the PSE. - (RO) The Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation No 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions requires land, rail or waterborne freight carriers operating within the Community to provide information on their rates, applicable agreements, terms of carriage, as well as the necessary documentation."
"Thus, operators are forbidden to discriminate by applying differential rates (with reference to the same product being carried in the same transportation system on the same route), but discriminations are created according to the country of destination or of origin."
"This is a very important Regulation, but as it had been in force since 1960, it needed updating."
"The draft amendment simplifies existing legislation and ensures more stability in the conditions applicable to the transportation of goods."
"According to the statistics provided by the Commission, it is true, as the Commissioner said, that the Regulation will affect or will have some bearing on the activity of some 300 thousand transport operators, and this amendment will reduce Europe-wide administrative expenditure by some €160 million/year."
"The European Parliament intends to reduce by 25% the administrative burden on enterprises by the year 2012."
"The proposal for the amendment of the two Regulations, as put forward to the Commission, is among the measures designed to achieve that objective."
"It is true, however, that the Committee on Transport was notified in the codecision procedure, which is contrary to Article 73(3) of the Treaty."
"Hence the proposal put forward by Mr Costa as rapporteur was adopted unanimously."
"(DE) Mr President, it would be negligent of me if I were not to reiterate, on behalf of our Group, what the Commissioner said in his opening words, namely that our Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism has truly fulfilled his remit as committee chairman in dealing with this fairly unspectacular but nevertheless important regulatory issue of air transport services, especially because he succeeded in obtaining unanimous support within the committee."
"We hope that the unanimity of our vote has made his life and his work much more agreeable and I just wanted to emphasis this a second time."
"Mr President, I congratulate the Commission - and you do not hear that very often from up here, do you?"
"But this is a rare example of a report that is on the right road - to Damascus?"
"We insist on debating this proposition, for it seeks to cut regulation."
"It admits that small businesses are being weighed down by unnecessary legislation, some of it going back to 1960."
"The explanatory statement says that these unnecessary administrative burdens hamper economic activity and have a negative impact on the competitiveness of enterprises."
"I could not agree more; why stop here?"
"Why only limit unnecessary paperwork from 10 employees or less?"
"Let us go the whole hog and apply it to the whole of the foodstuffs industry!"
"Go on, make a bonfire of another 100 000 pieces of legislation!"
"While you are at it, scrap the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"I am serious."
"By cutting regulatory burdens, you enable the nations of Europe to throw off the shackles that will otherwise inevitably turn us into the economic also-rans of the 21st century."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to say that we are using more words than necessary here."
"It seems to me that we are fully in agreement: the amendments needed to be made and go in the right direction; it is right to separate the two sets of legislation in order to abolish discriminatory transport conditions."
"My only recommendation would be that I repeat tomorrow what I said in committee, in the hope of achieving the same outcome: a unanimous, or almost unanimous, vote on this proposal."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday."
"Airport charges (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Stockmann, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on airport charges - C6-0056/2007 -."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, of course it is always better when the Commissioner is present, as there are some critical points that I would like to put to him directly, but I will have to do this at a later time."
"For more than 15 years we have been trying, or rather the Commission has been trying, to lay down a regulatory framework in the form of an EU directive on airport charges."
"Two attempts have already failed because of the conflict of interest between the airports and the airlines and between the different Member States."
"On this occasion, too, there was a great deal of conflict and I cannot recall a single one of the 189 amendments in committee that was generally accepted by all the parties involved."
"Many airlines want to see as much cost transparency as possible from the other side, the airports, and a regulatory authority that would ultimately set the prices, along with the introduction of the 'single till' system."
"Many airports would prefer no change whatsoever to the status quo."
"Moreover, the negotiations were also hampered by the structural particularities that exist in various Member States."
"The United Kingdom, for example, already has a rigorous regulatory authority, the CAA, while at the same time most of the airports want to be deregulated and indeed the trend is in that direction."
"In Sweden, Portugal, Greece, Finland and Spain many of the airports are operated in a system of airport networks with standard airport charges, which means cross-subsidisation and often results in little transparency."
"In Spain airport charges are even laid down by Parliament, in other words the Members of Parliament decide on the levels that will apply."
"In Germany this area has been controlled at federal level and not by a national authority, while in the new Member States airport charges are needed to a large extent to develop the airport infrastructure."
"I mention all these different interests if only to demonstrate how complicated these negotiations have been."
"What we have achieved to date has therefore been primarily directed at settling these conflicts of interest, for we in the committee are of the opinion that such a regulation is needed and that every effort should be made to agree on one."
"So what has been achieved so far towards settling these differences?"
"We have reduced the field of application to airports with either five million passenger journeys or more a year or 15% of the national passenger throughput in the Member State concerned, for in the case of regional airports with less than five million passengers a year the risk of an abuse of market power is either small or absent."
"Secondly, we have stipulated that airports will be free to choose their preferred business model, and thirdly, we have included airport networks generally within the scope of the directive."
"Fourthly, we have firmed up the role of the regulatory authorities and allowed them to delegate all or part of the provisions to regional regulatory bodies."
"Fifthly, we have introduced stricter requirements for the intervention of the regulatory authority and, sixthly, we have again allowed airport managing bodies to pre-finance infrastructure projects via their airport charges, as had been possible in the past, though subject to certain conditions."
"We want to see differentiation of charges based on objective criteria and according to the level of services provided and the environmental performance, and we want to see a system for defining and concluding an overall service level agreement."
"The compromises that have been negotiated were adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism with only one dissenting vote."
"That is a real achievement, considering the starting position, and on this point I would like to express my thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs for their close and constructive collaboration."
"We now have to lay down standardised principles of transparency, non-discrimination and regulated consultation and notification when setting airport charges in Europe."
"This will help reduce future distortions of competition and make it more difficult for those who might seek to abuse their market power."
"The directive will, in my opinion, make a significant contribution towards stabilising the inherent partnership that exists between airports and airlines and at the same time will strengthen Europe's position as an air transport hub."
"I therefore call on Members to support the Committee on Transport and Tourism in tomorrow's vote on the directive at first reading."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Stockmann for his considerable efforts and briefly present the proposal for a directive on airport charges."
"This proposal for a directive seeks primarily to transpose into Community legislation the principles that the Member States have already approved within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation: non-discrimination, transparency, consultation."
"The framework the directive establishes on this basis will allow us to provide a structure for dialogue between carriers and airports when determining and collecting charges."
"For instance, the directive will require airports to consult carriers before adopting a decision on charges."
"I took the same approach and consulted the air carriers and airports before drawing up this proposal, whose principles have been approved by both parties."
"The directive also introduces the concept of an independent regulatory authority in each Member State."
"This body will play a key role as it will ensure respect for the basic principles I have just mentioned."
"That is a brief outline of the goals of this proposal, for which Mr Stockmann is the rapporteur."
"Before continuing to the debate, I would like to thank your rapporteur and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for their support for the Commission proposal."
"Mr President, I believe that this proposal is fairly balanced, and as Mr Stockmann has just pointed out, we will undoubtedly have to be very vigilant about the way in which the directive is implemented in order to facilitate better cooperation between companies and airports."
"Thank you. I will now listen with great interest to the speakers in this debate."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Stockmann for his report and, on behalf of the PSE Group, I would inform the Chamber that we will be supporting the line adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Our rapporteur has done a fine job in producing a more realistic and balanced position, but I still find it difficult to understand why this proposal was put forward by the Commission in this format and at this time."
"Speaking now in a personal capacity: for many years within the civil aviation industry and with the Commission we have been fed a diet of deregulation and yet, in regard to airport charges, we are now being told regulation is the answer."
"I have to say that the irony of this is not lost on me."
"However, we are where we are."
"I fully support the need for transparency in airport charges, with full consultation with the stakeholders."
"I fully support the need to ensure that airports in a dominant position do not abuse that situation and I fully support an open and transparent appeals procedure, provided that the rules of engagement and the remit of the arbitrator are clearly defined."
"However, I very much doubt whether the proposition to regulate scores of airports throughout the EU is going to produce the utopia in airport charges that the airlines and the Commission want."
"Surely, if it is legislation to eliminate monopolistic practices that we seek, the regulation should be based on a market test relating to each individual airport, not an arbitrary figure plucked out of thin air for no apparent reason."
"I believe that, if you have to use a figure, you should use one that reflects the economic dominance of an airport, namely a percentage of national traffic, and address it to those airports that are dominant, not those which are not."
"I am not against regulating airports that are in a dominant market position, but I think regulating the majority of airports to catch the big boys, based on an arbitrary passenger figure in a one-cap-fits-all regulation, is a flawed process."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) I would like to congratulate Mr Stockmann on a report in which he once again demonstrates tolerance and competence in dealing with quite controversial proposals."
"This future directive touches upon quite a specific area and is not usual regarding its content."
"We all perfectly understand that the majority of airports work under natural monopoly conditions and they inevitably get into interest conflicts and the users, i.e., the airlines, may suffer for this."
"Thus we all understand that regulation is essential in this area, however there is also a risk that regulation may give the opposite effect - increased costs and expenditure may result in higher prices for the services provided by airports and this may in turn impact airlines."
"From the very first meetings with interested parties, the question of whether all airports should be regulated and if not then which and how many of them should be regulated rises."
"As a member of the Liberal Group, I am for regulation and state intervention in business which is as low as possible, all the more as I spoke to emphasize that about 25 airports in the European Community abuse monopolistic power or seek to do this."
"Therefore, my offer was such that regulation should encompass approximately that number."
"But to reach a compromise we agree with the position of the majority as well as other offers and have discussed compromises."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group - (HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"I would like to say how glad I am that a successful compromise has been reached in this new dossier where a joint decision is required."
"It has enjoyed the support of the various groupings at the Committee on Transport and Tourism level."
"It may emerge that whether this matter has to be regulated at all and what the threshold will be [...] airports, airports below the threshold [...] lower threshold."
"I believe that we have made a good decision in that we have only dealt with those principles which are truly necessary for there not to be a practice of Member States deviating and therefore playing off against each other."
"I am also glad that only airports that are really large or in a monopoly situation will be regulated."
"I also feel it is a joint success that a complaints process will only be initiated if the set threshold is exceeded."
"We have set realistic deadlines for this process, thus cutting short endless debates."
"I personally feel it is a success that we have in the text the opportunity for prefinancing, and preventing malpractice here too."
"We have created a joint compromise on the range of tasks for the regulatory authority and on owner independence."
"The greatest benefit will be transparency, which will offer a great deal of help in giving the public a proper breakdown of the price of an air ticket."
"The citizens of the Union will have their trust in the EU reinforced and at the same time the principle of subsidiarity will not be compromised as a result."
"We have not resolved all the issues."
"I expect to see debate with the Council over a good few questions, security charges for example, or double check-in systems."
"In any case we now have what I feel to be a very strong position and I hope that this success will guide us in our negotiations with the Council."
"Thank you, Mr President, and once again I apologise for the lateness."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner."
"First of all I would like to thank Mr Stockmann for the compromise he has achieved in this difficult area."
"In my view, the aviation market is actually the transport sector which calls for European regulation, since it is here that the national markets of the Member States play the greatest role."
"For that reason, it is very difficult to establish a non-discriminatory attitude towards EU aviation companies among the main owners of infrastructure in aviation, namely, airports."
"I am pleased that the Committee on Transport and Tourism is creating a compromise whereby discounts on charges may be applicable regardless of the quality or the quantity of services, and also to new routes."
"Also, with regard to the directive's scope and relevance, it seems that the directive is touching the aviation business in one of its sore points."
"The wish of many to reduce the number of airports covered by the directive is proof of this."
"Thank you."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there was another reason why the debate on airport charges and on their common regulation took such an extremely long time."
"An additional factor was the endless series of interventions in the course of the debate in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. This dossier was the subject of extreme lobbying, in other words there were lots of monetary interests tied up with it, and we as Members of this House have to ask one or two questions."
"What is behind all this?"
"Why is this happening? Why such a hard fight, why such tough arguing?"
"The answer can always be found by asking: who benefits from intransparency?"
"The old question of who gains, or as the Latin puts it cui bono, helps provide an answer here."
"Intransparency always benefits those who have market power, those who can dictate the conditions."
"Only in very few cases is this beneficial or even fair to the consumer."
"There is unfair competition whenever there is a lack of transparency, when there is concealed patronage and when there are hidden subsidies."
"This is why I considered it very important that we should produce a common regulation."
"For me the downside is that we were not able to regulate a much larger number of airports."
"I would also have liked to include the smaller installations within the scope of the directive, for these are often in unfair competition with the larger airports because they massively promote the low-budget carriers."
"Just one final point: I believe that it is very important to introduce an amendment that will link airport charges to emission performance."
"This is an opportunity for us to lessen the environmental impact of the air transport industry and at the same time to reduce the noise nuisance for the more seriously affected residents."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, airports have much more influence on our economy, our spatial planning, our traffic on the ground and our environment than we could have foreseen in the past."
"Large airports with an important role as international transfer hubs, or as entry points to major conurbations have developed into shopping centres, business locations for offices and distribution companies, hubs for public transport on the ground and tollgates to the surrounding area."
"They are either an important policy instrument in the hands of the authorities or they have been sold to an international company that seeks only profit and expansion."
"They also make profits outside the aviation sector, engage in international competition and find themselves involved in conflicts of interest with airlines, passengers, other users and local residents."
"Airports can be misused, because they can force every party that is dependent on them, from airline to passenger, to contribute disproportionately to their profit."
"These expensive airports also lead to the development of smaller competing airports nearby, with lower charges, poorer facilities, taking up even more space and resulting in even more areas suffering nuisance."
"If the European Union regulates the income of airports, this should not be in order to safeguard the profits of these companies or to limit airlines' costs, and nor should it be in order to strengthen aviation by offering passengers the lowest possible fares."
"The aim must be to protect the environment as much as possible from the unremitting expansion of aviation and to promote safety in the best possible way."
"It should also be about transparency, so that flows of funds and unwarranted differences in rates of charges can no longer be covered up as business secrets."
"An outcome is now taking shape in which airports with between 1 and 5 million passengers per year will not be covered by these rules."
"It would not surprise me if this resulted in more investment in smaller airports in densely populated areas."
"On other aspects too, such as the complaints procedure, the stringency of standards and the level of profits, the text will be moderated in comparison with the original Commission proposal."
"I anticipate that this will lead to the persistence of abuses and within a few years the demand for stricter rules will increase."
"Mr President, this report on preventing the abuse by airports of their competitive position can count on my endorsement."
"I am especially satisfied with it on three points."
"The first is the adjustment of the field of application."
"Not all airports are able to abuse their position."
"The concentration on larger airports is sensible, therefore, and so I disagree with some of the previous speakers."
"Secondly, I am happy with the opportunity for differentiation of charges in the report."
"In view of the harmful environmental effects caused by aviation at and around airports, the instrument of differentiation could encourage the use of cleaner and quieter aircraft."
"I also share the view that we should guard against putting an excessive administrative burden upon airports."
"For the sake of transparency, they should disclose certain information, but having said that we need to keep a sharp eye on costs and confidentiality."
"Finally, I would like to say something about Amendment 19."
"While I warmly welcome an independent regulatory authority, I think that the wording of Amendment 19 could lead to problems in some countries, because the establishment of procedures and their supervision is assigned to one and the same organisation."
"I hope that the discussions with the Council will offer the opportunity to resolve this issue satisfactorily."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and I look forward to the continuation of the debate on this report."
"Mr President, the Commission talks much about promoting competitiveness in industry and about cutting red tape, but its walk in these issues is often one that takes Europe in quite the opposite direction, and so it seems to me with its stance on air travel."
"Having championed increased costs for air travellers through green taxes, we now have a proposed directive on airport charges which will inevitably drive up costs for the flying public."
"Regional airports are my particular concern."
"They have been a catalyst for progress in many regional economies: they have opened up markets; they have made the inaccessible accessible; they have been indispensable in economic transformation."
"And now, true to form, the Commission wishes, effectively, to stifle them with the heavy hand of bureaucracy, burying innovation under a mountain of reporting requirements for which the traveller will ultimately pay."
"I say this to the Commission: if the genuine reason for this directive is to tackle the abuse of dominant position in the market, then why does it include regional airports at all, when they are not the problem?"
"In my own constituency of Northern Ireland, its airports are key to its development, yet last week, when President Barroso was providing sound bites of support for Northern Ireland - and on the very day that we open a new route between Belfast and Heathrow - we have this Commission proposal which will hike costs and discourage expansion."
"For those reasons, and without apology, I will vote against this proposal."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee of Regional Development. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"First, my apologies for the delay and thank you for allowing me the floor."
"The creation of a transparent system for airport charges is of paramount importance since there is currently no standardised regulation governing this."
"The Commission's Framework Directive has provided for a method of levying airport charges but gives Member States enough room for movement too."
"Airports and air traffic are of particular importance to the European Union since they are a link with the regions, create jobs and attract businesses."
"They make a significant contribution to social and economic cohesion in the EU."
"With privatisation and the arrival of commercial players, the previous balance in airport charges has been thrown a little out of kilter."
"The airlines complain that the major airports behave as a monopoly."
"This problem is cured by the draft Directive which promotes proper market competition since the proposal states that the charging systems and the airports setting them cannot discriminate between the different airlines."
"With certain exceptions the charges must reflect the real costs of services or infrastructure."
"Objective and clear criteria must be established for any charge differentiation or increase, so that users of airline and airport services pay clearly identified prices - the same charge for identical services."
"The consultation mechanism we are introducing is also important."
"If the airlines are not satisfied with the charges levied on their behalf they can have recourse to an independent regulatory authority."
"Finally, I feel it is very important to put on record the need for the Commission of the European Union to prepare a report on the success of the Directive for the European Council and the European Parliament within 4 years of its inception."
"This report would assess results and show whether the objectives of the regulation have been achieved."
"Thank you."
"(DE) Mr President, there have been some wonderful arguments, at least in abstract and general terms, over whether we should have deregulation or over-regulation."
"However, when it comes to the individual case it is always possible that either of these solutions will prove to be the most practical."
"On the subject of airport charges the Commission was, in my view, quite right to put forward a proposal for a directive, even though in the case of the Costa report we were also right to praise the efforts being made to reduce the administrative burden."
"Airports are important economic players and there are positive as well as potentially negative consequences associated with the key economic role they play."
"In its proposal the Commission has put forward an interesting concept, though perhaps it is somewhat too finely woven."
"We in the Committee on Transport and Tourism have made a few changes, and I hope, and indeed believe, that these are for the better."
"Our rapporteur, Mr Stockmann, held a series of lengthy talks with all the stakeholders, and especially with the various groups in this House, before producing some excellent compromises that we were for the most part able to support."
"I would just like to focus on three aspects."
"Firstly, we wanted to ensure that the directive would prevent individual airports from abusing their dominant market position."
"Secondly, we need Community-wide provisions in order to establish a smooth-functioning, non-discriminatory, transparent and comprehensive procedure for calculating these charges."
"Thirdly, it is logical to set up an independent regulatory authority in each Member State in order to ensure that the provisions are implemented."
"I am assuming that our proposals will be adopted tomorrow in plenary by a large majority and would like to congratulate the rapporteur, in particular, on his excellent work."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Stockmann for his excellent report and good cooperation."
"I think that when we reach the end of the legislative process we will have taken an important new step toward achieving a situation where the most important European airports are finally observing the same rules when it comes to levying all kinds of charges for services related to landing, take-off, airport lighting, parking of aircraft and the processing of passengers and freight."
"The field of application was one of the major sticking points."
"I think that the compromise is excellent: 5 million passengers, 15% of the flights in a Member State."
"Account should also be taken of the fact that in our compromise we have made provision for Member States to be given the opportunity, if necessary following an enquiry, to require other airports in the same Member State to comply with these regulations too."
"I think that there are four important elements."
"The first is that transparency is the constant theme right through the legislation and the imposition of relevant objectives and transparent criteria for determining the level of airport charges is essential."
"The second is that variation in the level of airport charges will continue to be possible, and I also have in mind, for instance, variation based on environmental performance, based on noise nuisance."
"This would make a steering policy possible."
"The third important element is that a clear and compulsory procedure is worked out for consultations between the airport managing body and users and that a good complaints procedure is established."
"The final element is that clear agreements are to be made on pre-financing of significant investments in the airports and how these can be costed."
"To sum up, I think that we can come up with a good end result if the Council has the will to do so."
"I realise that there will be a few problems on the way."
"I am also thinking about the approved amendments on financing security measures, which were mainly intended as a means of exerting pressure to find a solution for another issue, as you know."
"Meanwhile that is over and done with, and so I think that we in Parliament should be more flexible in the remainder of the procedure."
"(LT) The directive proposed by the European Commission ensures cooperation between the institutions controlling airports and the users and this will not allow large airports to ignore the interests of clients and take a monopolistic position in the market."
"That is why I want to favour this report as a member of the Committee on Regional Development."
"Air transport has to meet the economic and social needs of regional communities and it is important to emphasize that 90 percent of European Union citizens live not in the capital cities."
"Therefore, it is necessary to ensure success in the functioning of regional airports as this will help to increase the attractiveness of the regions."
"The presented document reduces the risk of a monopolistic position by the largest airports and this will help to soften the environmental, infrastructural and transport problems facing large airports and the cities located near them."
"Namely this will enable a more rapid pace of development at regional airports and ensure the social and economic development of regions in various countries."
"The distribution of freight and passenger flows is a very important base for effective regional development."
"Therefore, I encourage support for Mr Stockmann's report once again."
"(PL) Mr President, one of the European Union's responsibilities is to ensure that the Community market develops in accordance with the principles of fair competition."
"The directive on airport charges aims to prevent potential abuses by airports enjoying a dominant position on the Union's market or in particular countries. It was proposed because not all countries apply transparent procedures when calculating airport charges."
"The new provisions are to apply to 67 large airports."
"I think we would do well to remember that the development of airports, especially smaller ones, plays an important part in promoting regional development in Europe. It makes a significant contribution to evening out economic differences between individual regions of the Union."
"This is especially true in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"My country, Poland, is one of the leaders in air transport."
"The Polish air transport market grew by 13% last year and is amongst those enjoying the most dynamic growth in the world."
"Air traffic growth calls for substantial investments, however."
"That is why it is essential to allow smaller airports to include in their airport charges part of the cost of long-term infrastructure development projects."
"This would be of great assistance in financing their development."
"(PT) Mr President, in this one-minute speech I would like to highlight the amendments we tabled in order to ensure that this directive takes explicit account of the constraints suffered by regions that are permanently at a geographical and natural disadvantage, such as the outermost regions, particularly in accordance with Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty."
"We believe that the directive must explicitly recognise the importance of airports to the social and economic development of these regions and to territorial cohesion."
"Adequate exceptions must therefore be included in the directive, hence the proposal that, for airports situated in these regions, the rules laid down in the directive will not apply where they will not guarantee compliance with the universal public service obligations."
"We hope that this proposal can count on your support."
"Mr President, I think it is useful, from time to time, to remind the Commission that Ireland is an island and that we have a complete dependence on airports to be part of Europe and part of the rest of the world."
"The important issue for me is regional airports and that they get full support."
"In many cases I keep hearing the argument that helping small airports will increase the carbon footprint but I do not think that is true."
"When all flights go out of Dublin, it just means that all the people who live near Cork Airport, as I do, or Shannon Airport or Waterford or Kerry, have to drive to Dublin or take a second flight - a shuttle to Dublin - and then go on."
"Whereas often these flights could reasonably, with support for regional airports, go from a regional area directly to where they need to go."
"My other point concerns disabled passengers."
"It was not long ago that, when you got the breakdown of charges for airports in Ireland, it would have a wheelchair charge."
"Many disabled persons contacted me and asked that this be removed because they felt that other passengers would feel that they were paying extra because of people in wheelchairs."
"It is very important that we realise that one out of every ten persons in Europe will have a disability, possibly even more than that - up to 17% sometimes - and that there should not be specific charges."
"(PT) More and more journeys are being made in Europe and to Europe, but it is becoming increasingly expensive to travel in and to our continent."
"The factors giving rise to this higher cost, such as the increased price of oil, security costs and the reduction of CO2 emissions, are persistent factors that are very clearly here to stay."
"In this context, our goal must be to encourage a truly competitive airport market, which is only viable where there is transparency and predictability."
"These are, I believe, the main virtues of this proposal for a directive in its version currently being debated, to which Mr Stockmann has significantly contributed."
"One of its particular virtues is the set of general rules for determining and levying airport charges, which lay down common principles to prevent any abuse of a dominant position."
"As these rules apply to around 70% of airports, this very correctly avoids imposing legislation on smaller or regional airports where this risk does not exist."
"In addition, as regards situations such as those that exist in Portugal or Finland, for example, where air traffic is managed by associations or networks of airports, provision is made for harmonised charges for all, provided that they are compatible with competition rules."
"The following points must also be highlighted: the establishment of a duty for airport operators and users to exchange information, transparency requirements and the method of calculating airport charges."
"The creation of an independent national regulatory authority that will intervene only in the event of definitive disagreement over a decision on airport charges will also contribute to the proper functioning of the market."
"Finally, I must conclude, Mr President, by saying that the definition of strict and transparent criteria for using charges to pre-finance new airport infrastructure projects simultaneously protects the public interest in the development of airports and new airport infrastructures and also the rights of passengers, in other words consumers, whose interests must, after all, be the main focus of our attention."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his patience in listening to and noting the various requirements that reflect the existing diversity of the airport systems in Europe."
"I would also like to congratulate the Commission on being sensitive to the fact that that diversity cannot, however, imply systems that are far from transparent, which can be discriminatory or provide for limited participation on the part of the various stakeholders and users."
"Following the rapporteur's in-depth dialogue and arbitration, I believe that the current text offers us a very useful instrument to ensure that the three main stakeholders - national authorities, airports and airlines - resolve their differences, in short for the benefit of the workers and passengers. It will enable them to provide a high-quality service that is in keeping with the requirements of the new passengers and with the new requirements surrounding accessibility, greater security, less environmental impact, especially as regards noise, and less conflict and legal uncertainty through better consultation."
"Perhaps it might have been better to make the application criterion simpler, stipulating only a percentage, which might have given a more representative result."
"In any event, I am pleased that the text recognises the operational capacity of the airport networks, which have proved to be a very useful system for countries such as my own, where serious seasonal problems affect the airlines."
"In addition, I would also like to add to this the proposal to accept parliamentary or judicial methods of ensuring the current rates."
"(FI) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Stockmann, for having prepared the debate on this issue so thoroughly."
"I nevertheless wish to focus attention on something else, from the point of view of someone who lives in a sparsely populated country of long distances between population centres."
"Airports in Finland form a coherent network, where standard pricing applies in the main."
"This arrangement has guaranteed reasonable operational costs, even at airports with little traffic located in remote districts."
"Air connections to these areas are vital."
"Amendments 9 and 16 take account of the existence of an airport network, but small airports are treated unfairly."
"I hope Parliament will take into consideration the different conditions that exist in the Member States and shape the directive in a way which enables maintenance, development and funding of a national airport network on a uniform basis."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that I appreciate the work undertaken by Mr Stockmann, the rapporteur, and by the Commission."
"The competitiveness of the European economy calls for a transparent and rational approach to airport charges."
"The latter are a significant component of the carriers' operational costs."
"This issue concerns not only airport owners but also airlines and therefore passengers too."
"Airports of national or continental importance are affected along with regional ones."
"The question of the size limit arises. Is the proposed amended criterion of 5 million passenger movements or 15% of passenger movements in a particular country appropriate?"
"In no circumstances should these provisions impact negatively on passengers."
"The services provided by airports must comply with the criteria for safety and punctuality of arrivals, departures and transfers."
"We are all aware that at the moment our airports differ considerably as regards punctuality culture."
"In some of them the passenger is treated as a nuisance."
"Improvements and better passenger service would be most welcome."
"Mr President, I am very pleased at the outcome of the negotiations that have been ongoing for a number of months, and I am glad to see that a common-sense approach has been taken by Parliament."
"The original European Commission proposal that this directive would apply to all airports with passenger numbers greater than one million per annum was extremely worrying, particularly from an Irish viewpoint, because, if this approach had been adopted, then the directive would have applied to both Shannon and Cork airports, and possibly, in due course, to Ireland West Airport as it seeks to continue its expansion operations."
"What I have been arguing is that airports under the five million passenger per annum threshold are subject to much stronger market forces than larger airports, and to subject them to the terms of this directive would put an unnecessary stranglehold on regional airports."
"Given the position adopted by Parliament today, we can now expect larger airports to be more transparent with their pricing policies and financing of infrastructural developments."
"We will also see a strong independent regulation in all Member States to ensure that airports and airport users do not abuse their dominant market power."
"I am particularly glad that, while appeals are being dealt with that airport users cannot delay plans adopted by the airport, I myself think that the six-month notice of price changes, while biased against the airline, will ensure adequate time for agreement and negotiation, if necessary, by both parties."
"The fact that the airport user cannot delay airport plans will allow airports to begin infrastructure plans without delay and thus save them - and ultimately air passengers - money, as they will most likely be the beneficiaries of added cost projections."
"I would like to thank my colleagues in Parliament who supported my amendments to the original proposal, and who supported my view during the negotiations, which will mean that regional airports - the smaller airports - will continue to be free, at least for the foreseeable future, from more red tape and costs of bureaucracy."
"Again I join with everybody: congratulations to Mr Stockmann, the rapporteur, on a job well done."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must thank and congratulate Mr Stockmann for his openness and capacity to achieve compromise between the various interests involved in the preparation of this high-quality report, particularly with regard to the outermost regions."
"I support the broad lines of the Commission's proposal and I am committed to this report because it guarantees non-discrimination in airport charges, except where this is compatible with, and necessary under, the Treaty, specifically with regard to forecasts for the outermost regions."
"A compulsory procedure for consultation between airport management bodies and users must exist."
"Any differentiation in charges must be transparent and based on clear criteria, taking into account the principle of territorial cohesion."
"According to our proposal, future remodelling will be possible for objective and transparent reasons of public interest, particularly in relation to universal access."
"Member States must ensure, and I quote, 'that airports levy the same charge for the same service."
"The airport managing body may grant airport user concessions on charges based on the quality of a service used, provided that the concession in question is available to all users of the airport under publicised, transparent and objective conditions."
"It may grant a concession to users which open new routes ... in accordance with EC competition law ..."
"The President cut off the speaker"
"(SL) As an MP, a traveller and a pilot, I am pleased that with this directive the Union is for the first time regulating the sphere of airport fees, which I find useful for several reasons."
"Firstly I think it is crucial that it is allowing us to determine common principles for the levying of airport fees, which will lead to greater clarity and less discrimination."
"The second emphasis I see is the initiation of dialogue between airport authorities and airline companies, which should mean that greater attention will be paid to passengers, whether in terms of their safety or the quality of service."
"It seems to me important that with this directive we have shown our favourable attitude towards the development needs of airports, i.e. the possibility of higher taxes, but under the condition that there is a dialogue with the users giving them clear information and ring-fencing the taxes exclusively for developmental purposes."
"Finally, I would like to give strong support to the establishment of independent regulatory bodies in the hope that, in accordance with the principles of proportionality, it does not lead to excessive bureaucratisation."
"I am especially thinking of those Member States that have one large airport and one largely state-owned national airline."
"Although in such cases we do not need extensive regulatory bodies, it is urgently necessary to provide a structural separation of that function from activities relating to ownership or supervision."
"Allow me also a remark about terminology: In my opinion it is more appropriate in English to use the term ""independent regulatory authority"" than ""independent supervisory authority"", because the latter could be understood as some kind of inspection body, which is not intended by this directive."
"For the second reading I propose that the possibility of exception, or opt-out, be introduced under certain conditions for those airports operating in special circumstances."
"My congratulations to the rapporteur and those cooperating with him."
"(RO) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Stockmann, on his significant improvements to the Commission's proposal."
"All the airports falling within the scope of this Directive will be subject to the same rules of transparency and will provide information regarding the calculation and use of airport charges."
"According to Recital 1, the main task of airports is to ensure the handling of aircraft, from landing to take-off, and of passengers and cargo."
"Given the wide range of activities taking place in an airport, it is necessary to clearly define the responsibilities of each entity and in particular the manner of funding of these activities."
"However, we should pay particular attention to the possibility of actually enforcing this Directive in all Member States."
"Continued dialogue between airports and transport operators is indispensable."
"One of our amendments asks for airport charges introduced to cover security costs to be used exclusively for implementing security measures."
"Member States should also use Structural Funds in order to develop the infrastructure of their regional airports."
"According to Eurostat data on five new Member States, air passenger traffic increased by 25% in 2006 in relation to 2005."
"Over the same period Romania has seen the most significant increase (35%)."
"Mr Stockmann, as rapporteur, you will have the opportunity to speak at the end of the debate."
"Do you wish to speak now or wait until the end?"
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, even though 'catch the eye' is not really intended for rapporteurs, I would just like to direct one or two questions to the Commissioner because he did not hear my presentation of a short while ago."
"I will be brief, when I get the next opportunity."
"All right, that is clear, but we have to finish our list."
"We shall therefore move on to the next speaker and then continue with the 'catch-the-eye' procedure."
"Mr President, I believe the essence of this debate can be summed up with the question: how do you measure market dominance?"
"This directive is the Commission's attempt to bring a large number of Community airports under regulation, and it has seen fit to do this because it believes there could be an imbalance in the relationship between airports and their users, the airlines."
"In some cases they are right; the more sizeable airports in the EU, like London Heathrow and Paris Charles de Gaulle, should be regulated so they are not in a position to abuse their market dominance."
"But I believe the smaller regional airports of the EU should only be regulated when they are found to be operating anti-competitively."
"So, back to the question: how do you measure market dominance?"
"A system that captures every Community airport with passenger numbers of five million per annum and above is arbitrary but certainly better than one million."
"And, where an airport accounts annually for more than 15% of the passenger movements in the Member State, that is better too - but still arbitrary."
"Newcastle Airport in the UK, for example, with 5.2 million passengers, still has to compete with other airports all over the north of England to attract business."
"Why add burdensome and costly red tape to the smaller regional airports that do actually compete with each other and need to grow?"
"That is why I want the possibility for national regulators to opt out their airports from this regulation."
"The secondary aims of this directive are, however, very good."
"Common rules on provision of mutual information, transparency and the collection of charges is something which I applaud."
"But surely, in this case, the Commission should not regulate further than that for regulation's sake."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner about those points on which our position in the committee differed significantly from the Commission proposal: firstly, on reducing the scope of the directive to 5 million passenger movements; secondly, on the inclusion of airport networks, which is a completely new point; thirdly, on firming up the responsibilities of the regulatory authorities and allowing them to delegate duties to regional bodies; fourthly, on pre-financing, which the Commission had not included, even though it is allowed under the ICAO."
"Finally, I have one more question: what is your position on the differentiation of charges according to environmental criteria?"
"These are the questions that I would still like to see answered."
"Mr President, in the interests of not repeating anything that has been said, I fully support the need for more transparency in airport charges."
"As charges at airports are not part of the operational costs of airlines but are part of the operational, development and maintenance costs of airports, I would like to know the Commission's view on the compulsory need for airlines to refund airport charges if a passenger has to cancel a flight."
"At the very least they should get full credit, if not an actual refund of any airport charges on a cancelled flight."
"I do not think it is acceptable for airlines to pocket airport charges if flights are cancelled."
"Some of them are doing that at the moment, others will refund after taking a hefty administration charge out of it, which makes it unworthy to pursue the actual refund itself."
"That is a small point but a very irritating point for passengers in the EU, and I think we should say something now and tie that in to what we are talking about here."
"(RO) Since we have the duty to ensure transparency, correct information for users and passengers, and quality of air transport services and since, during the first 11 months of 2006, 211 new regional routes were created - thus generating 1 800 new flights a week - I would like to ask the Commission what measures are being taken to inform passengers of airport charges, as passengers unfortunately do not know their rights when flights are cancelled or delayed."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank your rapporteur, Mr Stockmann, who has prolonged our dialogue."
"We - and I, personally - engaged in dialogue with the airports and the airlines."
"Thank you, Mr Stockmann, for having listened to both sides because it is not easy to establish, to some extent, the rules for good dialogue that allow balanced solutions to be achieved and that ensure that airports in dominant positions cannot abuse that position."
"I will now respond to your questions, Mr Stockmann."
"As far as the number of passengers is concerned, we feel that 5 million is acceptable."
"It is essential to take the networks into account and I accept that."
"However, I am very reluctant to support the delegation of duties to regional authorities."
"This could be dangerous and I do not see how it would be of any benefit."
"We need an impartial authority that will ensure that the airports concerned are subject to the same conditions regarding dialogue and the determination of charges."
"I support the differentiation of charges according to environmental criteria."
"However - and I am going to come back to this - there is no reason to envisage any pre-financing of infrastructures."
"When looking at how to manage an airport successfully and the charges to be collected, it is obviously necessary to anticipate future infrastructure requirements."
"There is no need for pre-financing."
"In addition to those answers, I would now like to respond to some of the comments made."
"Firstly, I would like to say to Mr Simpson that the directive has managed to stay away from regulation and bureaucracy."
"What we want to see is respect for the basic principles."
"The Member States have already accepted these principles within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation."
"We do not want to introduce regulation for the sake of it."
"I honestly believe that we can genuinely say that we have found the best framework for ensuring good dialogue between the airlines and the airports, and, in my view, it is as part of this dialogue that progress will be made in the area of transparency."
"Mr Allister said that the directive was going to make regional airports more expensive."
"Quite the opposite is true, however!"
"On the contrary, through transparent accounts, through this obligatory consultation, through non-discrimination among carriers, we will in fact ensure, particularly in certain regional airports, that there is complete transparency and that it is easier for the consumers, the passengers to travel by air, without any nasty surprises."
"As I said, and I am responding here to Mrs Lichtenberger, the directive allows the Member States to establish charges or taxes on the basis of noise pollution or other environmental aspects."
"However, since this directive is trying to stay away from over-regulation, we do not need to define every one of those taxes."
"In response to Mr El Khadraoui, I would say that it will certainly be possible to adjust the charges on an environmental basis."
"The Council proposed this and I intend to support it."
"Some of you have asked me about the problems concerning flight cancellations."
"To be honest, the text does not deal with that issue, so it is difficult for me to respond."
"There has been a great deal of progress on passengers' rights, and that must continue."
"I would ask you, Madam, to contact me in writing so that I can provide a more precise response to your question, which, I admit, is quite legitimate, like that of Mrs Ţicău, who also spoke."
"Mr President, I would now like to outline briefly the Commission's position on the amendments."
"A number of the amendments tabled by your rapporteur strengthen the Commission's goal of improving the relationship between airports and airlines."
"Mr Stockmann, the Commission can take over 21 of the amendments that contribute to that objective."
"I would mention, in particular, the amendment on the definition of a charge, Amendment 12, and the amendments on airport networks, Amendments 14 and 16, with a few changes to the wording."
"The Commission had initially proposed that the directive should apply to airports whose annual traffic is over 1 million passenger movements."
"The Commission accepts the new limit proposed in the first part of Amendment 7 since it seems to be supported by the majority of both Parliament and Council."
"However, 27 of the amendments tabled by your rapporteur cannot be taken over as they stand and would need to be discussed in more detail."
"These include, in particular, the amendments on security charges: Amendments 13, 21, 22, 23, 24."
"This issue was the subject of long and heated debates."
"A compromise was reached during conciliation and it seems, Mr Stockmann, that these amendments are therefore no longer necessary at this stage."
"In addition, the directive cannot apply solely to cases of infringement of competition law."
"As such, the Commission cannot accept the amendments concerning situations where airports have a dominant position in relation to their users."
"The scope of the directive is broader than that."
"We therefore feel that Amendment 7 in part, Amendment 16 in part, Amendment 19 and Amendment 20 are unnecessary."
"Nor can the Commission accept the amendments on the pre-financing of airport infrastructures."
"The collection of a tax before an infrastructure is operational is contrary to the principles on which the directive is based."
"However, this does not take anything away, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from Mr Stockmann's excellent work, which, in my opinion, has considerably improved this draft directive."
"I have commented on a number of amendments, but I must once again thank Mr Stockmann and the Committee on Transport for the quality of their work and for helping us to move forward with this important text, which will enable us to structure the dialogue between airports and airlines."
"We want to prevent the users from being victims of this lack of dialogue and we want to prevent a situation whereby, due to a lack of transparency, a number of practices can be implemented without any real possibility of approving them."
"Those are the comments I wanted to make. I would like to thank Parliament for its commitment to this proposal."
"I think that it should provide our airports and airlines with the means of establishing permanent dialogue that will benefit all of the parties concerned."
"Commission's position on amendments by Parliament"
"Stockmann report"
"Amendments acceptable: 8, 10, 11, 12"
"Amendments acceptable in principle: 3, 21, 27, 29, 30, 33, 35, 40, 44, 45"
"Amendments acceptable with redrafting: 14, 15"
"Amendments partly acceptable: 7 (1st part), 16, 17, 18, 22, 35 (1st part)"
"Amendments rejected: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 31, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 46, 47, 48"
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank everyone for their comments and suggestions."
"We still have a certain distance to go together and there will be some hard bargaining when the Council presents its common position."
"In recent weeks it has become apparent that the Council is coming over to our way of thinking on several points, including the scope of the directive, the subject of airport networks and the rejection of 'opt-outs' by national states."
"However, there are also some new points that have not yet even been discussed, such as setting national upper limits on charges."
"There therefore needs to be further internal discussion on these matters."
"It will first of all be important to reach as much common agreement as possible on these points tomorrow so that we have a strong negotiating mandate when presented with the Council's position."
"I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for the detailed position that you have presented."
"I would just like to conclude by explaining why infrastructure pre-financing is so important for this Parliament: for one thing, it is possible under the ICAO; secondly, we naturally do not want to see a sudden escalation of charges when the new infrastructure comes on the market; and finally, of course, there is a large backlog demand, not just in Eastern Europe but in other new Member States too."
"However, I know that this is a contentious issue and we will have to wait and see what progress can be made here."
"Thank you again and I look forward to further discussions with you and with my fellow Members here."
"May I also thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) The initiative of clarifying the regulations concerning airport charges and the development of transparent, non-discriminatory procedures for the calculation of these charges is welcome, because it prevents any abuse on the part of market-dominant airports."
"Transparency and the uninterrupted exchange of information between air transport service providers and clients are thus ensured for both individual airports and airport networks."
"Moreover, Member States may apply the provisions of this Directive to other airports within their territory, thus encouraging competition and implicitly reducing airport charges, for the benefit of end-users."
"Due to the existence of common standards, passengers will get the same services for the same prices, and cost-effectiveness will be the only criterion used by airports in the management of their equipment and services."
"The appropriate enforcement of these procedures will be ensured by the establishment of an independent national regulatory authority in each Member State."
"It is my firm belief that European citizens will benefit first and foremost from this regulation."
"Other benefits will include: further investment in the aviation sector, improved passenger safety, security and trust, which in turn will lead to a significant long-term contribution to the development of air transport in the European Union."
"Export and import of dangerous chemicals (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Johannes Blokland, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals - C6-0439/2006 -."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank and congratulate the European Parliament and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, as well as Mrs Mann and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their excellent reports and the views expressed at first reading."
"For the last 30 years the European Union's policies and legislation on the protection of public health and the environment have made significant progress in reducing the risks posed by chemical substances, not only in the European Union, but also worldwide."
"The European Union has constantly been an important partner in international conventions, including the Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade."
"Regulation 304/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals implements the Rotterdam Convention within the Community."
"On many points the regulation does not stop at the provisions of the Rotterdam Convention, but goes further by offering a higher level of protection for countries that import chemicals."
"On 10 January 2006 the Court of Justice of the European Communities adopted a judgment annulling Regulation 304/2003 on the grounds that it should have had a dual legal basis, namely Articles 133 and 175(1) of the Treaty."
"In response, the aim of this proposal is to adopt a new regulation with the aforementioned dual legal basis."
"At the same time, the Commission, on the basis of its report on experience to date in implementing the relevant procedures, has put forward certain technical amendments to the provisions of the regulation."
"This report was submitted to the European Parliament and the Council at the same time as this proposal."
"The Commission's main proposals for amendments to the regulation are as follows:"
"Firstly, certain exceptions are being proposed to the central requirement for explicit consent in countries of import prior to export."
"These exceptions are implemented only in cases in which, despite reasonable efforts on the part of the Commission and of the national authority designated by the country of export, there is no response to the request, and provided that certain conditions are met."
"These exceptions are intended to create a certain degree of flexibility, while at the same time maintaining a high level of protection - one which is, indeed, higher than that provided by the Rotterdam Convention."
"Secondly, an exception is proposed to the requirement of explicit consent in cases where chemicals are exported to OECD countries, if certain conditions are fulfilled."
"Thirdly, the rules relating to the period of validity of explicit consent are clarified."
"In addition, explicit consents are reviewed at regular intervals, as well as in cases where alternative evidence is accepted."
"Fourthly, procedures and means to allow access by the customs authorities to information are laid down, since in most Member States these authorities play a principal role in ensuring compliance with the regulation, especially as regards controlling exports."
"Madam President, I should like to express my satisfaction with the efforts we have all made to reach agreement on this regulation at first reading."
"The European Commission is able to accept the compromise package of amendments in order to reach agreement at first reading."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, as rapporteur for the import and export of chemicals, I am pleased to be able to report here that we have achieved a good result at first reading."
"I would therefore like to thank everyone who collaborated on this."
"I am thinking particularly of the secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the shadow rapporteurs and their staff, who were outstanding in the support they gave me."
"I greatly appreciated the good cooperation with the Council, especially with the Portuguese Presidency, and the European Commission."
"It was a technically complex proposal, and the discussion sometimes became quite heated on the question of what exactly was best for the environment."
"The most important thing that we have achieved, in my view, is that through this new regulation the trade in dangerous chemicals will be dealt with in an ethically responsible manner."
"We especially wanted to operate from the principle that will be familiar to you as the golden rule: 'Do not do unto others what you would not want done to yourself'."
"Although this is an ancient principle, which we find in the Bible, as well as in other religions, this aspect led to the usual discussions."
"The original Commission proposal did actually contain very liberal arrangements for allowing the export of dangerous chemicals with tacit consent."
"This was proposed, while for developing countries especially it is important that there is complete transparency about what is being imported."
"After all, we are talking about substances that are banned in the European Union or severely restricted."
"I believe that we have got a good result in the agreement reached."
"It means that the protection and awareness-raising of developing countries is guaranteed when it comes to dangerous substances."
"Madam President, this new regulation properly implements the global Rotterdam Convention, which was adopted in 1998 but has only officially been in force since 2004."
"I can therefore wholeheartedly recommend that everyone vote tomorrow in favour of the agreement reached with the Council."
"Finally, Madam President, I would also like to make a case for the Council and the Commission to do as much as they can to extend the list of substances in the Rotterdam Convention."
"There are about 40 substances on the list of the Convention at the moment."
"There are certainly 200 substances that have been nominated to be assessed and possibly added to that list."
"To protect developing countries especially, we need to set to work energetically on the other substances."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (DE) Madam President, I should like to extend my warmest thanks most especially to the rapporteur and the Commission, and of course to the Council too."
"We have presented a very good report here."
"We in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have given a high priority to producing a practical regulation that will control the international import and export of hazardous chemicals in a reasonable and logical way and that is sufficiently coherent that the importing countries can understand what we in the European Union are trying to achieve."
"That essentially was the main problem, namely that we had put in some nice things and we had put in some dangerous things but no-one could understand what it actually all meant, all the stuff that we then added in the supplement to the international list."
"The proposal before us is a good regulation and I hope that it will be understood at international level, so that it can also be properly applied."
"Things that are not understood will of course not make much sense."
"This can be just as dangerous; if something is not understood then it will not work no matter what."
"The Committee on Industry is satisfied and I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, for having negotiated with such persistence and common sense that we ultimately achieved a good compromise."
"I would just request that we do not try to add further to the list immediately but that we test out what is there so that we then actually have a piece of legislation that works."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation before us, as you know, concerns a highly technical issue."
"That is why there was no provision for a debate originally, but now that we have the opportunity to express our point of view after all, I would like to say something briefly on behalf of the PPE-DE Group."
"I am also very pleased that, after a number of informal consultations with the Council and the Commission, we have reached an agreement at first reading."
"This was only possible in fact thanks to the efforts and openness of our rapporteur, who was willing to listen to all parties."
"Naturally I also thank the Commission and the Council for their contributions."
"Now the present regulation on the import and export of certain dangerous chemicals, in addition to the dual legal basis - Article 133 and Article 175(1) - and a number of technical changes, does indeed focus, as the rapporteur has also already mentioned, on the amended procedure for explicit consent, which is dealt with in Article 13."
"The informal discussions mainly concentrated on that issue."
"I am convinced that greater flexibility is appropriate in some cases, not only to safeguard the export interests of European countries, but also to guarantee the highest level of protection of the environment and public health for all parties concerned."
"That way certain dangerous chemicals may still be exported without explicit agreement or consent, but under very strict conditions."
"I think that the wording in the agreement ensures that the safe export of substances is guaranteed and even strengthened."
"This last point was indeed achieved by scrapping part of the Commission's original text."
"As the PPE-DE's shadow rapporteur, I am also confident that, together with the Council and the Commission, we have reached a good, balanced and practicable compromise."
"I hope that my fellow Members will approve everything tomorrow."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, first of all I would like to welcome the report and of course I welcome the implementation of the Rotterdam Convention, which is an important international convention on the ban of several dangerous chemicals."
"The topic is not unknown to me."
"I worked as the shadow rapporteur of the PSE Group on the restriction of several chemicals, including the ban of PFOS and the export ban on mercury, and now I and my colleagues are working on the restriction of ammonium nitrate and other substances."
"We had good cooperation on these issues with my colleague Mr Blokland."
"We have to understand that a European-level ban is sometimes not enough."
"For instance, DDT and lindane have been banned in the EU for many years but their presence can still be detected in the blood of our citizens."
"Following the European ban on certain chemicals, it frequently happens that several multinational companies produce and sell the banned chemicals in non-EU countries, especially in the Third World."
"Then the banned chemicals easily return in imported products and they are also present as environmental pollutants in oceans, seas, rivers and air."
"The export ban on mercury, fully supported by this House, showed us the right reaction."
"The same treatment is needed for other dangerous chemicals as well."
"I underline the importance of the international chemical conventions - the Rotterdam Convention, the Stockholm Convention and the SAICM - as only these instruments can lead to an international solution to the problems caused by chemicals."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I also wish to congratulate Mr Blokland for an excellent report and for the admirably skilful way with which he has handled all the procedural issues concerned with this important report."
"Additionally, I wish to thank him for the respect and attention he has shown to all shadow rapporteurs."
"The Commission proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals, enriched with the compromise joint amendments by almost all the parliamentary groups, will present a set of adequate and much-needed rules which will most likely provide protection of public health and of the environment at a high level."
"The serious problems caused by unscrupulous international merchants of toxic substances are well known and feared, and it is very much hoped that the implementation of the Commission's proposal will assist in helping developing nations to counter the serious hazards to the well-being of their citizens and to our environment."
"Apart from the substance of this piece of legislation, it is also noteworthy that it demonstrates to some extent the usefulness of the Court of Justice decision concerning action of the Commission against the Council and the European Parliament."
"At the same time, it raises questions as to why such actions had to be taken in the first place, and why the three core institutions of the EU could not find ways of agreeing amicably and without the need to resort to court deliberations."
"Such action inevitably brought about delay, was expensive and may have caused a certain amount of avoidable interinstitutional animosity."
"Nonetheless, it has happened, and it must now be put behind us - although it must perhaps guide all of us to perhaps take wiser decisions in the future and avoid court actions as much as possible."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Madam Chairman, let me thank Johannes Blokland for the excellent cooperation we have had throughout the process."
"It is ten years since the Rotterdam Convention was signed, and it was said then that prior written approval should be sought for the export of dangerous chemicals."
"After all we are not dealing with just any chemicals; the list of chemicals contains the most hazardous chemicals used by man on earth today."
"So it has taken ten years."
"One reason for that is the stubborn attitude of the old Commission which insisted that it was just a commercial matter."
"I thank Stavros Dimas for ensuring that we now have an appropriate legal basis and can take things forward."
"Nor was it always easy to negotiate with the Council."
"I was shocked when the Presidency thought that lethal chemicals, which are in practice banned in the EU, could be exported to other countries over long periods without prior consent."
"The reason for this was that the Council did not want European industry to be at a competitive disadvantage."
"The real competitive disadvantage to our industry, however, would arise if it were forced to jeopardise health, the environment and international law in order to survive."
"It is absurd to claim that we have to breach international conventions just because others do not comply with rules and standards."
"You might as well say that the EU should export illegal drugs because, if it does not, the Mafia will."
"I am glad that we were able to agree in the end and finally plug the loophole for non-approved exports."
"We now have legislation which does not just cover Convention chemicals but also contains requirements for other chemicals which are strictly controlled in the EU."
"These must now be assessed against health and environmental criteria by the appropriate authorities prior to export."
"It is good that the period for exemptions has been shortened from 36 to 12 months."
"It is also good that chemicals contained in products are covered."
"Finally we have legislation which is acceptable and improves on the Commission's proposal but could have been even better if public health and the environment had taken precedence over corporate interests; that is after all the only sustainable economic model."
"(DE) Madam President, I too would like to thank Mr Blokland."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament has changed tack and has closed this massive loophole."
"We know that there are more than 1.5 million cases of poisoning and nearly 30 000 deaths a year in the developing world."
"It would have been appalling if the Commission's proposal had come into force, as this would have meant that dangerous chemicals could be exported without the authorisation of the importing countries provided that no response had been received within 90 days."
"It would also have been a very questionable interpretation of the health and environment legislation if we had continued exporting when on the one hand we are laying down a new safety landmark by way of the latest pesticide certification, while on the other we are doing the very opposite with our exports."
"The EU should not just be ensuring a high level of protection on its own doorstep but should also be advocating the same for the rest of the world, and this paradoxical softening of the export rules would have done nothing for the EU's credibility."
"What is more, we need greater transparency when it comes to the export of chemicals and pesticides."
"There needs to be a better system for disclosing the quantities of products being exported by the EU Member States."
"After all, we are talking about the movement of goods that are subject to restrictions and prohibitions and we in the Member States need maximum transparency in this area."
"We therefore require more information on the quantities involved and on the particular Member States the materials are coming from."
"Madam President, as we are new to this procedure - and, having looked around, everybody else present has spoken - does that mean I can have five minutes myself?"
"I assume I can have at least two, which was the time taken off our side to allow the 'catch-the-eye' procedure."
"It is a matter we need to clarify."
"I stand to support colleagues on this important regulation, which is on its second trip through the committees and these houses, because of a Court of Justice ruling 12 months ago that it should have been a dual legal base originally."
"The main point I want to speak on under the 'catch-the-eye' procedure is my general concern about legal bases and the trouble we have been running into here, not just with this piece of legislation but also with others."
"A lot of time is spent, at committee level as well as plenary, in debating amendments in relation to single versus dual legal bases and different views."
"I think it is time that this Parliament took stock of exactly the procedures we arrive at - different legal bases - because, often, dual legal bases are proposed to us or are proposed at Council coming back to us before a common position is reached for what I would call sloppy legislating reasons, because the larger the EU gets - 27 Member States now and growing, and I welcome that - the harder it is to be tidy in our legislation."
"We really must look at what we are doing in this area."
"So it is interesting that the reverse is true here."
"In fact, the Court of Justice has said that we need a dual legal base in this particular area rather than the single legal base, which normally makes life much easier - if we can keep to a single legal base - because very often dual legal bases have been lawyers' charters."
"I wonder whether the Commissioner could indicate what exactly the challenge to the Court of Justice was in relation to the single legal base, who took it, and if he could give us more information on why the Court of Justice itself determined, if you like, on a dual legal base."
"They have given us time to go through the procedure again and have maintained the effects of the regulation until we readopt it, as it were, and I very much welcome the fact that it looks like we are going to have a first reading agreement because of all the cooperation all round."
"The Commissioner's views on that and on the whole saga of the legal base that has us here a second time would be very welcome."
"I allowed you the extra time, as I did others, since the five minutes were obviously not excessive given that there are not many Members present, but only this once."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, I would like to thank all the speakers for their positive comments."
"I fully acknowledge and share Parliament's desire to achieve a high level of protection for human health and the environment, particularly in those countries that do not have the requisite infrastructure or capacity to correctly handle hazardous chemicals."
"I also fully agree with the view that the European Community should play a leading role in establishing a legal framework for the Community so as to ensure a high level of protection."
"On many points, the regulation does not restrict itself to the provisions of the Rotterdam Convention, but lays down implementing conditions that offer a high level of protection for all the countries of the world, not just for members of the Convention."
"I am convinced that this example will encourage other countries to follow suit and to join the Convention."
"The Commission will make every possible effort to support the Rotterdam Convention to enable these goals to be achieved."
"In response to the concerns voiced on arsenic and mercury, the Commission would like to stress that, pursuant to Article 22(3) of Regulation 304/2003, if metallic arsenic is banned or subjected to a rigorous restriction within the Community, then a proposal will be submitted for the application of the relevant annex."
"Furthermore, the Commission stresses that work is in progress in the Council and in Parliament concerning the proposal to ban exports of mercury to countries outside the Community, a ban which, as long as it is in force, goes beyond the requirement for consent imposed by the Rotterdam Convention and the Community regulation, which implements it."
"Once again I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts and their excellent work, in particular Mr Blokland."
"The Commission is particularly satisfied with the result of negotiations and considers all the proposed compromise amendments to be acceptable."
"As for the dual legal basis, it would, in fact, have been much easier and simpler had we had a single legal basis, but we well know the problem that arises so often: here we have, if I remember rightly, Article 133 with Article 175, while in most other cases we have Article 95 with Article 175."
"Certainly, in proposing a legal basis, we always rely on the opinion of our Legal Service."
"Here, as I have already said, we have dealt with trade and the environment, and this was the reason for the European Court of Justice's decision on the dual legal basis."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, Mrs Doyle and Mr Matsakis raised the problem of the legal basis and Commissioner Dimas, who I also want to thank warmly for his reply, also touched on this."
"The problem, when I was rapporteur, was indeed that the President of the Council came to see me and said: 'We in the Council are unanimous in having serious problems with ""trade” as the legal basis; we want to take advice from our Legal Service and make it ""environment”'."
"Parliament consulted its own Legal Service, and our Legal Service was absolutely confident that the legal basis should not be 'trade' and that it had to be 'environment'."
"On that basis we came to this conclusion then, almost unanimously, at least in the Council."
"It would actually have been better if we had not taken this problem to the Court of Justice, but had opened up negotiations with the Commissioner, with the President of the Council and with Parliament in order to find a political solution to this problem."
"What happened then?"
"Yes, fortunately the regulation has come into force."
"It worked: the Council treated the matter as urgent, Parliament treated the matter as urgent."
"However, there was a great deal of discussion, and in the end that led to everyone being in the wrong: the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"The Court of Justice pronounced a kind of judgment of Solomon and said: dual legal basis, while the Council and Parliament had been assuming that you could not have that, that it was impossible."
"In a situation like that you end up in the position that we are all in the wrong, that it has cost years of delay, though fortunately not at the expense of the developing countries, as the work carried on anyway."
"In any event, we spent quite some time on this."
"I think that we should act together to prevent these problems in future."
"When Commissioner Dimas had his preliminary interview with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we also raised this problem with him."
"We also raised the problem in the three hearings with Commissioner Verheugen and with the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso."
"We had the positive impression at the time that it was not so much a decision of the Commission to go to the Court of Justice but a decision of the Legal Service."
"I think that from now on it should be left not to the lawyers but to the politicians to resolve this problem."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) The proposal for a Regulation concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals is an improvement in the use of chemicals, in that the health of the population and the environment are protected more effectively."
"The regulation aims to encourage the joint accountability of exporters and importers and to support them in their cooperation effort so as to ensure control over the international circulation of hazardous chemicals."
"The new regulation amends the definition of the exporter so as to include persons who export such dangerous chemicals from the EU but are not resident in the EU, thus ensuring an effective control and supervision of the flow of hazardous chemicals."
"The Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure, whereby certain chemicals require explicit authorisation by the importing country, also helps trading countries to obtain more accurate information concerning the hazardous chemicals prohibited on environmental and public health grounds which may transit importing countries."
"Nevertheless, the PIC procedure is no substitute for effective and sustained border controls, and Member States should cooperate to ensure the effective management of the movement of these hazardous materials on their territory."
"in writing. - (DE) The new regulation on the import of certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides now includes a number of sensible technical amendments."
"In the past, international trade in this area was forever being halted because of administrative obstacles. This was mainly due to the fact that the importing country had to give its 'explicit consent' before the goods could be shipped out."
"There is no doubt that this consent is absolutely essential when dealing with potentially hazardous substances and for this reason it is a requirement that should be retained."
"The principle of subsidiarity is, after all, one of the pillars of the Union and it is important that the Member States themselves should in future still be able to determine which potentially hazardous substances are allowed to cross their borders."
"However, from the point of view of free trade we need to retain a certain amount of flexibility in this area."
"Having more room for manoeuvre also makes it easier to prevent those countries whose import surveillance systems have not yet been sufficiently developed from being taken advantage of by exporters whose operations are not effectively monitored."
"The current compromise takes these considerations into account and not only ensures that potentially dangerous chemicals are traded in a responsible way but also provides the room for manoeuvre that is needed so that the international exchange of goods can continue to run smoothly."

"Community strategy on health and safety at work 2007-2012 (debate)"
"(EL) On the agenda for discussion, we have the report by Glenis Willmott, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, concerning the Community strategy for 2007-2012 on health and safety at work (2007/2146(ΙΝΙ))."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, health and safety at work encompasses a vast array of issues."
"At a simple level, it is about reducing accidents at work and work-related illness."
"For the individual, it is about his or her physical integrity, dignity and well-being."
"For businesses, it is about reducing the costs of absenteeism, sick pay and loss of productivity."
"For society as a whole, the costs of poor health and safety at work have been put at an astronomical 3.8% of gross national product."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights, signed last month in this very Chamber - despite the disgraceful outburst of certain UKIP and Conservative MEPs - provides in its Article 31 that everyone has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity."
"It also provides that every worker has the right to limitation of maximum working hours."
"The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work estimates that every year over 140 000 people in the EU die from occupational diseases and nearly 9 000 die from work-related accidents."
"These figures mean that every three and a half minutes somebody in the European Union dies from a work-related cause."
"That means that, in the short time I have been speaking already, it is possible that somebody has died and, by the time this debate is finished, it is probable that 20 people will have died."
"Some of our colleagues may contest the fundamental right to good health and safety at work, but I am sure none of them would question the right to life."
"A health and safety at work strategy for the EU should be strong on properly implementing and enforcing the existing regulatory framework."
"What we already have in place is largely very good, but it does need to be consistently enforced throughout the Union."
"However, this does not mean that, where existing legislation is clearly inadequate, we should not update it in order to make it work properly and provide the best levels of protection possible."
"It also does not mean that we should react to suggestions for legislative instruments like a vampire does to garlic, as some would do in this House."
"Of course, no one would argue that the legislative route is always the best."
"However, there are cases when binding rules are necessary in order to ensure that a new or emerging risk is properly and consistently addressed in all Member States."
"The Commission communication is to be welcomed and applauded for its target to reduce work-related accidents and its strong focus on SMEs."
"However, we also need to focus on occupational illnesses which have a huge cost in terms of workers' health, the cost to businesses and their productivity and to society as a whole through associated social security and health care costs."
"The report reflects this and urges the Commission to ensure that occupational diseases are correctly identified and remedied, with a particular focus on occupational cancers, with a view to setting targets for their reduction."
"We also need detailed action plans with financial and timing commitments."
"Besides the targets for a 25% reduction in accidents, there appear to be few ways in which progress can be monitored and measured."
"Priorities for action identified in my report include a carrot-and-stick approach to enforcement of existing legislation."
"I would like to see the Member States reward business for good health and safety with tax rebates and a preference in calls for tenders and the introduction of a bonus-malus system in insurance policies, as well as other financial incentives."
"However, I would also like to see tougher sanctions for those rogue employers who neglect the health and safety of their workforce, as well as more infringement proceedings against Member States who do not adequately implement and enforce the existing health and safety legislation."
"Any health and safety strategy should naturally focus on those who are most at risk."
"Such vulnerable groups include migrant workers, who are often exploited, as well as young and ageing workers, who need special attention, and those with disabilities."
"It is essential that the 1989 Framework Directive be rigorously applied to these groups and other workers who are often ignored, such as agricultural and health care workers, when drawing up and implementing their strategies."
"The Member States need to take full account of these groups."
"We need a framework directive on musculoskeletal disorders to address a problem such as lower back pain - repetitive strain injuries, effectively - and lower back disorders."
"There are lots of other issues I would like to raise but we are running out of time, so I look forward to hearing other colleagues and what the Commission has to say."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I would like first of all to thank Mrs Willmott for the excellent report which she has prepared on the Community strategy on health and safety at work."
"The Commission places a high policy priority on health and safety at work, and shares your views on a large number of your recommendations."
"Indeed, I would like to emphasise that it must be a Community strategy and not merely a Commission strategy."
"This is truly the only way to achieve the fundamental and ambitious aim, which is a continuous and sustainable reduction in occupational accidents and diseases."
"One of our foremost concerns, therefore, will be the participation of as many sides as possible at political, operational and institutional level."
"The Commission's strategic aim of achieving a 25% reduction in work accidents in the European Union in the years 2007-2012 does indeed require the active participation and commitment, not only of the public administrations, but also of the social partners with their responsibility, at workplace level, for preventing accidents."
"It is very important to stress the commitment which the Member States entered into with the Council resolution of 25 June 2007: to develop and apply strategies for public health and safety at work, geared to national conditions, in cooperation with the social partners, and also to set national, measurable targets for reducing accidents at work and the incidence of occupational illnesses, especially in those sectors of activity in which the rates are above average."
"The Commission is particularly pleased with the European Parliament's response to its communication, and with the support for the general priorities and lines of action set out in that communication."
"I have noted Parliament's concerns regarding the need for adequate planning and distribution of resources, and regarding the assessment of progress, and submission of progress reports, in respect of the strategy targets."
"The Commission will provide details and the exact plan of the special measures to be taken at Community level, on the Community Agenda scoreboard."
"We will also secure the participation of the Advisory Committee on Health and Safety at Work, within the framework of a three-way exchange of information on the content of the national strategies, the targets, the actions undertaken, and monitoring of progress made."
"Parliament will be promptly informed of the results of this procedure."
"As regards your request for a review of Council Directive 91/383, I would like to inform the honourable members of the European Parliament that the departments of the Commission are at present analysing the situation in various Member States on the basis of a study prepared by an external consultant."
"In 2008, a relevant report will be drawn up, and the Commission will decide what further action to take in this area, taking account of the conclusions of the report."
"As regards the request for review of Council Directive 92/85, I would also like to inform you that the departments of the Commission, after consulting the European social partners on possible amendments to that Directive, are now carrying out an impact assessment to determine the consequences of certain amendments to the Directive."
"If, on completion of the impact assessment, the Commission decides to submit a relevant proposal, there is little doubt that this proposal will be approved by the Commission in 2008."
"I share your view on the need, within the coming period, to improve the enforcement of Community legislation on health and safety, especially for SMEs, with a combination of measures which will give balanced emphasis to employer responsibility and worker participation."
"As regards occupational health, I expect the new strategy to be a further step towards creating a healthier work environment throughout the EU, where the needs of an ageing employee population will be met and the more vulnerable groups will be fully protected."
"The Commission will intensify its efforts in the direction of adequate definition of health indices and other statistical measures, to ensure that occupational health hazards are properly monitored."
"We are confident that the priorities set out in the Community strategy 2007-2012, and those set out in the report which you will approve today, will open the way to safer and healthier workplaces in the European Union."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - Madam President, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality stresses in its opinion that the most significant health problems presented by women and caused by their working conditions are musculoskeletal disorders and psychological problems, on the one hand."
"On the other hand, it stresses that the need to analyse the risks that women and men face and take appropriate measures does not mean the reintroduction of protective policies of exclusion, nor does it mean developing different jobs for women and men."
"Even though the framework of Community occupational safety and health (OSH) directives is neutral in its approach to gender, it is not a sufficient reason for work-related risks to women's health and safety to be underestimated and neglected compared to the risk to men's health and safety, both in terms of prevention and research."
"Workers, male and female, across the European Union are exposed to different risks in their workplaces: chemical, biological and physical agents, adverse ergonomic conditions, a complex mix of accident hazards and safety risks, together with various psycho-social factors."
"Therefore, women and men do not constitute a homogeneous group."
"Consequently, strategies and measures to improve OSH must be specifically adapted to particular workplaces, taking into account the fact that some factors might affect women and men differently."
"The opinion also stresses new risk factors such as harassment, violence and bullying by clients at the workplace, mainly in public service sectors that employ mostly women."
"Finally, it emphasises the need to consider the introduction of hazard, risk and prevention concepts in school curricula and the educational systems in general as an effective means of building a strong and sustained preventative safety and health culture."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I express my thanks to Mrs Willmott for the fair and constructive nature of our cooperation in committee."
"The report reflects the high priority attached to health and safety at work in the 27 Member States of the European Union."
"The key safeguards are emphasised and weighted."
"The cost of accident prevention and safety is high, but let me stress unequivocally that good health is priceless."
"The important points are that the provisions should be transposed and applied in all Member States and that the European Union should help Member States to transpose the rules and should offer them advice rather than meting out punishments."
"I believe that particular attention should be focused on small and medium-sized enterprises, which need assistance in this field if they are to remain competitive."
"In this respect we call on the Commission to create the appropriate basic conditions for SMEs in cases where these conditions do not yet exist and to improve them where they do exist."
"The protection afforded to employees must not depend on the country in which they work or the size of their company."
"In the brief time at my disposal I only wish to list a few points of particular importance, such as better protection against hepatitis and AIDS and the continued systematic removal of asbestos from workplaces, however complex and expensive that may be."
"I believe we must focus on hepatitis B and especially on those people who run a high occupational risk of infection by hepatitis viruses, in other words medics, paramedics, carers and first aiders."
"In the realm of first aid, efforts must also cover those people in many Member States who, in addition to their daytime jobs, perform unpaid voluntary work with the emergency services."
"I believe it was very important that the report stuck rigidly to the subject and avoided citing examples, which might well have engendered prejudgement of many issues."
"Thank you for our fruitful cooperation."
"The EPP-ED Group endorses the report."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 6 December 2007 an accident at a ThyssenKrupp factory in Turin caused the death of seven workers."
"That extremely serious incident shows that the safety problem has certainly not yet been resolved."
"The tragedy in Turin also raises another matter for consideration in this Chamber."
"We would have expected this multinational to conduct itself properly, but that was not the case."
"Italian newspapers reported yesterday that in a confidential document drafted by a senior manager of ThyssenKrupp following the tragic steelworks fire, and seized by the magistrates' court, the survivors interviewed after the accident were described as workers setting themselves up as heroes and stars on television. There are no words to describe that allegation other than as a disgrace."
"It would be very important if this Parliament, as also the Commissioner, aside from all formalities, could and would express their indignation towards ThyssenKrupp."
"What happened in Turin happens to some extent everywhere and, on the basis also of the very good Willmott report, underlines the need for a commitment to a very real reduction of accidents and deaths at the workplace."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, this is a very good report and I wish to thank the rapporteur for her cooperation."
"I am pleased that the report talks about better implementation of the current directives."
"I also welcome calls for better inspection."
"There is no point in Member States paying lip-service to implementation, as many do in the field of health and safety, and then, quite often, calling for more legislation, even if the scientific and medical evidence does not establish a risk."
"One area which does require legislation - and we called for this in 2005 - is prevention of the more than one million needlestick injuries that affect healthcare workers each year across the EU."
"Imagine the horror of being accidentally pricked by a needle and then having a horrendous wait to see whether you have contracted a serious infection, such as HIV or hepatitis B!"
"The Commission must heed our call and bring forward an amendment to the 2000 Biological Agents Directive."
"In some areas, exchange of best practice is probably enough, which is why I am pleased that my amendments on health care-acquired infections were adopted in committee."
"Infections like MRSA are serious not only for hospital patients, but also for hospital workers."
"Rates of infection vary considerably between Member States."
"For example, the rate of infection in the UK is 10 times higher than in the Netherlands."
"We need to know why, and how we can learn from best practice."
"That is why, in one of my amendments adopted in committee, I called for an EU code of good practice on health care-acquired infections, and for the screening of all health care workers to be encouraged across the EU."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Willmott, for her excellent work and especially for having been so willing to compromise."
"More than 160 000 people are killed and some 300 000 incapacitated every year in the EU because of industrial accidents and occupational diseases."
"That is too many. In this society of ours in which the individual is often regarded as a mere production factor, too little emphasis is placed on the human aspect of this problem."
"The state, by which I mean legislatures and governments, must ensure that purely profit-driven business operators bear the social cost of exploitation."
"That is the only way to ensure that the necessary priority is attached to health and safety at work."
"Public opinion tends to take more notice of industrial accidents than of the wide diversity of occupational diseases."
"More extensive and vigorous efforts are needed to redress the balance."
"Improvements cannot be achieved without close scrutiny, in other words inspections and analyses and the setting of precise targets for reductions in the incidence of occupational diseases, including new illnesses affecting those who work in fields such as nanotechnology."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, adopting this report on health and safety at work would add yet more bureaucracy and red tape, just when I thought the Commission were intending to reduce that!"
"Workers losing time through illness and injury put up the cost to the enterprise concerned and hence their prices."
"In an EU of free movement of goods and services there is more competition, so those who do not look after their workforce lose business."
"People off work through illness also raise the cost of social benefits, contributing further to a rise in prices."
"It is therefore in a company's best interests to keep its workforce in good health."
"Good ideas always spread, so that should not be too difficult."
"This depends, of course, on there being a free market, but of course, if like some members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs you think this leads to the law of the jungle, then you have another serious illness to contend with."
"Apparently, Member States which promote a free market are psychiatric cases."
"(FR) Madame President, the suicides of Renault and Peugeot workers in France and the thousands of cases of lung cancer among people whose jobs involve contact with asbestos are clear evidence that health at work is a problem."
"In response, the European Commission has produced a communication elevated to the status of a 'health strategy', which in fact reads like something from Walt Disney - a resolution drafted by Snow White for the Seven Dwarfs."
"And it really is quite touching."
"In paragraph 35, for example, we are told that we need healthy lifestyles at the workplace; paragraph 29 is about encouraging medical examinations; paragraph 54 urges the installation of fire sprinklers; in paragraph 49 we read that stress is a threat to health; and recital D suggests, low and behold, that fatal accidents are more common among construction workers than among senior European civil servants."
"Luckily, the rapporteur for the Committee on Industry has solutions to offer, including the employment of a psychologist and a chaplain for every 500 employees."
"We are actually told nothing, however, about the causes of occupational illness - of which there are three."
"The first is the ideology of dismantling protection at our borders, thus placing our workers in unfair competition with Asian slave labour."
"The only way our industries can survive is by going all out for higher productivity, at the expense of health."
"The second problem is the daft policy of the strong euro, making us uncompetitive in terms of exchange rates."
"The only variable left to adjust is productivity, which is forced up once again, and once again health is compromised."
"The third cause of our troubles is the neurotic philosophy of competitiveness - in effect an economic war between Europe and Asia or Europe and Latin America."
"But wars result in casualties and deaths, and the victims in this case are the people afflicted by occupational illness and accidents."
"In other words, the European worker is out there like a bull in the global economic arena, stressed and bloody and giving his all, until his health has gone."
"The solution is to take our workers out of that global arena with its unfair rules, and that will require new customs technology for deductible customs duties."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to give an overview of the key points of this strategy and discuss the recommendations contained in my opinion."
"Guaranteeing equal social coverage of all workers regardless of the form of contract, speeding up bureaucratic procedures for small and medium-sized undertakings, and providing incentives, including financial incentives, for training are aspects of primary importance."
"To discuss only those aspects would, however, be less than generous towards those who rightly call for explanations and justice in face of dreadful tragedies such as the one that occurred a few days ago in Turin, to which Mr Panzeri referred a moment ago."
"During the night of 6/7 December, a fire that spread through the ThyssenKrupp factory killed seven workers; the fire extinguishers were not working."
"It was only later that it emerged that the factory did not comply with safety regulations!"
"The European Parliament and I myself cannot fail to record that disgrace."
"I certainly do not intend totally to condemn the conduct of the German multinational or even imagine that the factory, however guilty, maliciously and deliberately failed to comply with the safety requirements in order to save money."
"I will not espouse the ideological arguments put forward by some Italian left-wing union members who, on learning last June of the closure of the factory, set themselves up as champions of safety and declared that they were responsible for and took care of safety at the factory."
"However, the moment has not yet come to make judgments, especially hasty ones."
"While respecting national competences in the matter, I do consider it urgently necessary for the European Union to guarantee that laws are implemented in full, first and foremost by reinforcing the inspection activities of the Agency for Health and Safety at Work, and to strengthen the coordination between the various national agencies by improving the functioning of the European Senior Labour Inspectors' Committee."
"(EL) Madam President, there is no doubt that health and safety at work contribute to quality management, economic performance and competitiveness, and that they help in the development of the economy, and in the achievement of budget targets, including the budgets for the social security schemes."
"Of course, beyond all these technical matters, there are humanitarian reasons which make it not only necessary, but also a matter of priority, to protect the health of employees and ensure that workplaces are safe."
"The strategy for 2002-2006 has given positive results, and the prospects for 2007 onwards are positive if we all play a part - not only in terms of European planning, but also at the corresponding national level - in monitoring and planning for health and safety, especially in the vulnerable categories, which means young people, older employees - whom we are calling on to participate in production for a longer period of their lives - and also women, who are likewise called on to participate in working life."
"A working life with new demands, fragmented into many different kinds of contract, self-employment, and small and medium-sized enterprises which lack the capability of large enterprises to impose proper working and safety conditions."
"It must therefore be the concern of all of us to manage national and Community resources correctly, as the Willmott report proposes, so that the desired results can be achieved."
"(EL) Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating our colleague Mrs Willmott, because her report has to a large extent covered the serious gaps in the Commission's communication."
"Dignity at work means health and safety at work."
"It means carrying out studies on the prevention of occupational risks, and it means employers providing preventive medical check-ups."
"It means lifelong learning, vocational education and training."
"It means health and safety as key criteria for commercial agreements with third countries."
"But if these proposals are to carry any weight, a basic requirement is, of course, continuous social dialogue, but above all, we need to confront the fundamental threats overshadowing the area of labour relations."
"I am referring specifically to the spread of poverty among employees, the rapid growth of unofficial forms of employment, and the increase in working hours."
"If there are no fully human-centred policies capable of reversing this new employment ""dark ages”, social clashes are inevitable."
"(EL) Madam President, the measures proposed by the European Commission for strategy until the year 2012, are mostly superficial and concentrate on ensuring that competitiveness is not affected."
"The target of reducing accidents by 25% by the end of the strategy period may look impressive, but in reality it is completely inadequate."
"The target should be to lay the groundwork and reinforce the institutional interventions by the state, so that the tragic death toll of thousands annually - and similar numbers with serious health problems due to the quality of their working environment - comes closer to being eliminated."
"The rapporteur focuses rather on the exploitation to which employees are subject, such as those working in hazardous jobs, women, temporary workers, immigrants, the elderly, and proposes stricter measures against employers, and guaranteed supervision."
"One of the most significant contributions of the report is perhaps the finding that permanent employment is a requirement for combating accidents and work-related illnesses."
"In addition, apart from accidents, more attention should be given to the causes behind the onset of mental illnesses, addiction, and the psychological hazards of the workplace."
"What is needed, then, is a many-sided approach to all the factors affecting health and safety in the workplace."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I must admit that when I read the Community strategy for health and safety at work 2007-2012, which was presented last February by the European Commission, I was in many ways disappointed."
"Even though the Commission set out in this strategy a relatively ambitious target to reduce the number of industrial accidents by 25%, the strategy contains only a very small number of concrete initiatives and recommendations as to how to achieve this target."
"In addition, it focuses again mainly on industrial accidents, which are of course only one aspect of work-related health problems."
"Occupational diseases are somewhat neglected."
"This is, in my opinion, a step backwards."
"On the other hand, I must thank and congratulate Mrs Willmott on her report on this strategy."
"The report, unlike the Commission's document, contains many concrete proposals and recommendations as to how to achieve better results in the field of health and safety at work."
"I am pleased that the rapporteur is also stressing the need to define cancer correctly and to express cancer numerically as an occupational disease, to specify the targets for the reduction of this severe disease."
"Up to now only 5% of cancer cases caused by work were classified as an occupational disease."
"I have greatly welcomed the incorporation in the report of my amendment, which I tabled in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the need to secure for the general public free access to technical norms."
"This is a problem employees of many Member States are constantly struggling with and one that should be rectified."
"Madam President, if we are going to reduce workplace accidents, we need to know how they happen."
"We cannot study all accidents and all near misses but, let me tell you, a 19-year-old Irish lad died on a construction site because his lighter Japanese bulldozer had heavy European shovels."
"His death was registered as a construction death and the Irish Health and Safety Authority never looked any further."
"So how can we save the next person that drives a tractor with mismatched equipment? Because we do not know."
"We cannot investigate everything, but we can look at all fatal and debilitating accidents, especially those in the most dangerous sectors like agriculture, fishing, construction and transport."
"We need to break it down to make practical measures."
"Also, aside from risk jobs, we have very vulnerable sections of the workforce - elderly, disabled and workers who do not speak the language of their present workplace."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I too want to express my sympathy following the tragedy that struck the workers in the Turin factory;"
"I believe it is indisputable fact that there are too many deaths from occupational accidents in Italy because not enough is being done to prevent them and comply with the rules."
"Responsibility for this is shared equally between undertakings, unions and inspection agencies."
"We find undertakings that resort to illegal workers, especially from non-EU countries, or factories such as ThyssenKrupp, with their old-style industrial arrogance; those who should be defending the interests of the workers often consent to, if not connive in such situations, instead of being vigilant and quick to point out failings in the safety system to those in charge; finally, the works inspectorate and other bodies in charge of control and monitoring often fail to show much initiative."
"We must promote safety at the workplace in the EU and in that respect the Willmott report is more satisfactory than the Commission proposal."
"I believe that when we speak of work and industry, we must not confine ourselves merely to ensuring freedom of competition and competitiveness."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, people are still dying at the workplace."
"In an area where man should be able to demonstrate his ability to manipulate matter with force and creativity, to develop his knowledge and earn his living, we all too often find instances of death and threats to life and limb."
"That is why there is such anger and bewilderment in Italian public opinion about the seven workers who died in the fire at the ThyssenKrupp factory in Turin last December and why we must ask ourselves what was not working properly in that factory, so that we can avoid these disasters."
"We are responsible for such inadequacies in every place of work."
"Today we have highly-advanced legislation designed to support an appropriate preventive policy, define the obligations incumbent on undertakings and deal with new occupational diseases in Europe."
"What we lack, however, is adequate controls, inspections to ensure the laws are observed, staff and financial resources."
"We still do not have a culture that values the importance of rigorous preventive services, that regards prevention as a continuous process rather than as a one-off obligation, that establishes a continuous dialogue between the parties concerned with a view effectively to developing high safety standards, and that can spot the emergence of new psychosocial occupational diseases."
"In conclusion I also believe we must come back to the subject matter of the Green Paper on corporate social responsibility, which is a cohesive and innovative aspect, in relation to the commitment to reduce occupational accidents and diseases."
"(CS) To start with I would like to thank Mrs Willmott for her very carefully prepared report."
"It is stated that the Commission's objective is to reduce industrial accidents by 25%."
"I do not believe this will be possible."
"There is an insufficient number of work inspectors and they have insufficient tools at their disposal to make changes."
"The influence of the trade unions is being permanently reduced; in many countries they no longer take part in investigations into the causes of industrial accidents and eradication of their consequences."
"Further, there is the jungle that is the employment of workers by agencies, and there is also the pressure for constant expansion of so-called flexibility in the working time of employees."
"This leads to employees working many hours and the accident risks are increasing ."
"(PL) Madam President, the draft resolution emphasises the social responsibility of companies for health and safety at work, while paying attention to the issue of honest competition."
"It takes into account the great importance of dialogue between social partners, particularly the role of trades unions in improving safety in the work environment."
"It also draws attention to the need for special treatment of small and medium sized enterprises in the strategy for improving health and safety as well as the need to provide ongoing training to employees."
"The majority of accidents involve persons who are just starting work, who are lacking experience, as well as persons who have too little time for rest after work."
"It contains important comments concerning the rehabilitation and integration in the workplace of persons returning to work after an accident, as well as requirements concerning non-discrimination as regards access to work for persons with cancer."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"(PL) Madam President, we have been debating the European labour market strategy in this house for some years."
"We have many opinions as regards the direction our activities should take."
"There are those who favour a profound harmonisation of employment legislation, others who defend the view that the natural diversity in European labour markets is advantageous for the EU economy."
"As you know, my views on this matter favour the second view, with one important exception."
"This exception concerns the regulation of health and safety at work."
"I believe that, in this area, the active involvement of EU institutions is both justified and necessary."
"Following the most recent extension to the EU we can see an even greater diversity of work conditions."
"This diversity is both territorial and environmental in nature, as, whatever the country, the majority of work accidents and work-related illnesses affect such groups as migrant workers, young employees or older persons."
"I do not want to imply that these are groups that are subject to targeted and conscious discrimination."
"It is rather a consequence of insufficient education and lack of experience."
"All the more reason for providing appropriate work and safety conditions for just these workers."
"I would also like to point out that, in any Member State, we can see greater problems in complying with the highest safety standards at work in such sectors as construction, agriculture and transport."
"It is in these sectors above all that small and medium sized enterprises are found and their financial, organisational and legal capabilities make it difficult for them to comply with high health and safety standards."
"It is just these companies that require support from the European Union, from EU institutions and from the governments of Member States, and this support is needed urgently."
"It is not just a question of sanctions and increased monitoring."
"These instruments, which are of course essential, should be accompanied by investment in the education both of employees and employers as well as financial support for improved and safer workplace equipment."
"(RO) We welcome the good intentions of the Commission; however, we are in doubt as to their effectiveness."
"Accurate statistics concerning occupational diseases are required in order to maximize policy impact and to protect workers."
"Existing data are incomplete, either misjudging phenomena or ignoring reality."
"Women are the main victims of this shortcoming, primarily because they are more involved in informal, or ""grey"", economy."
"In this sector, the effects of working conditions on health are not recorded at all."
"The existing legal framework maintains an approach which lays emphasis on accidents and hazards in the so-called ""heavy”, male-dominated branches of economy."
"We call on the Commission for a more careful consideration of the specific differences between male and female employees and for an assessment of the availability of data broken down by gender and data concerning the long-term effects and psychological consequences of employment."
"To substantiate our request, we would like to invite you to take a tour of a textile factory."
"Sight and hearing can be significantly impaired, and the prevalence of circulatory disease is high."
"Statistics ignore the situation."
"This is so-called ""light"" industry, where most of the workers are women, and wages are also low because there are supposedly no risks involved."
"Thus, current statistics preserve the historical inequality between men and women, including the gender gap in payment."
"(DE) Madam President, a Community strategy for health and safety at work is absolutely essential."
"While technical health and safety measures are effecting rapid improvements, the meteoric pace of change in the working world poses new risks."
"The problems and hazards involved in working with new chemical substances are self-evident."
"First and foremost, however, the increasing pressure to perform which characterises the contemporary workplace creates not only physical problems but psychological problems too."
"Insecure jobs and people's fear of losing their livelihood lead to psychosocial problems."
"New potential for aggression builds up, new stress factors lead to mental abuse, and bullying becomes a common occurrence."
"SMEs are particularly susceptible to such contemporary phenomena unless these are curbed by means of countermeasures, information, supervision and training."
"Accordingly, this resolution is more important than is probably recognised."
"I congratulate the rapporteur."
"(DE) Madam President, health in the workplace must be given priority."
"Our Parliament buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg are among the places where more action is needed."
"Just take the ambient temperature in this chamber, which borders on a health risk."
"I also believe in the power of good example."
"A few months ago I was stranded in a hotel in Greece as a forest fire raged all around, and I must say that the hotel, a typical SME, had prepared for that eventuality in the most exemplary fashion."
"Had not all the safety precautions been perfectly devised, well organised and properly drilled, many of the people there could probably not have survived."
"That is why I believe that great importance attaches to this learning process to which Mr Ettl referred, this training and preparing for emergencies."
"Incentive systems would also be useful in this respect; insurers, for example, could allow appropriate discounts on premiums to companies with trained staff, and social-insurance schemes could also offer relevant training courses."
"- (SK) As a Member of the European Parliament and a physician, I welcome the Commission's plan to reduce industrial accidents within the European Union on average by 25% and I am aware of the need to implement more effective measures in all the Member States, among which there are huge disparities."
"Besides sectors such as metalwork, the construction industry, electrical work or forestry, I would also like to highlight the high-risk jobs of doctors and healthcare staff, who in their jobs are exposed to huge risks of infection and AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis and many other infections."
"I also regret that the reduction in the number of industrial injuries and occupational diseases in particular did not include, for example, migrant workers, workers with temporary contracts, workers with low qualifications, and women in certain companies, such as small and medium-sized companies."
"I would highlight the provisions in some countries that successfully implement comprehensive rehabilitation after an accident as a condition for successful return to the labour market."
"(RO) As ITRE rapporteur for this document, I have asked for the active promotion of involvement in European trade unions and I have called on the Commission to propose a legal framework that would encourage social partners to engage in cross-border bargaining."
"The European Commission and the Member States could provide funding for training labour representatives which would defend and promote workers' rights to safety and health at the workplace."
"We also asked all Member States to sign and ratify the UN Convention on the protection of migrant workers and their families and to coordinate the improvement of access to training, particularly for part-time workers and contract workers, to enable them to secure more stable employment."
"I believe that Member States should enforce the measure required for difficult or dangerous work to be recognised as such and reflected in the social protection of a person both during employment and after retirement."
"(RO) A European strategy on health and safety at work is a welcome initiative on the part of the European Commission."
"However, I believe that further aspects should also come under scrutiny."
"As one of the previous speakers very aptly pointed out, we should take into account that there is a special situation concerning immigrants on the European labour market."
"A recent study of the European Commission shows that migrants are exposed to much higher degrees of risk concerning health and safety at the work place."
"This is due both to the prevalence of illegal work, and to other factors such as: lack of awareness of social benefit and pension entitlements in Member States, and problems in the cross-border use of health insurance."
"Such matters fall within the Community remit, and the Commission should be closely monitoring the application of European laws, so as to improve the precarious circumstances of migrants."
"Moreover, European funding could be used for training additional labour protection inspectors who would identify failures to comply with health and safety regulations at the work place."
"Madam President, I would like to speak about needlestick injuries, because I was responsible for the 2006 report on this issue."
"I wonder whether the Commissioner would agree with me that, where a risk is identified that needs to be tackled at European level, then there is a need for the Commission to ask expeditiously."
"If he does agree, I wonder whether he can explain why it took a full year for the Commission to manage and assess the first round of consultation with the social partners on needlestick injuries, even though there were only 10 responses in that consultation."
"I wonder whether he can also assure us that work on this issue will proceed faster in the year ahead."
"One million workers a year are affected by needlestick injuries."
"That means around one and half million will have been affected since the report was completed by Parliament."
"Could the Commission please act a little faster in future?"
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I should like to thank my colleagues for their comments and to make just a couple of points."
"Firstly, on the issue of cancers, it is necessary to revise the Carcinogens Directive to reflect technical progress and changes in scientific knowledge in the world of work."
"It is important that we have effective binding limits for carcinogens, mutagens and substances toxic for reproduction."
"Limit values should be based on scientific evidence, and I would urge the EU Scientific Committee to examine crystalline silica as a matter of priority."
"I would urge colleagues not to delete reference to this and oppose Amendment 6."
"Secondly, the report calls for nanotechnologies to be monitored and potential risks to health assessed, and I would urge colleagues to oppose Amendment 5, which seeks to delete this. I fully recognise the potential benefits of nanotechnologies."
"Nevertheless, the rapid growth of such technologies is outstripping our understanding of the potential occupational health risks: workers can be exposed to nanoparticles through inhalation, dermal contact and ingestion, and we cannot bury our heads in the sand and refuse to carry out research and assess whether there are any risks."
"Thirdly, I would just like to reiterate the call for the Commission to bring forward a legislative amendment to the Directive on risks from biological agents at work in order to address the problem of needlestick injuries."
"This needs to be done as a matter of urgency."
"As I mentioned earlier, health and safety is a fundamental right included in the Charter."
"We need a strong EU strategy to ensure that this fundamental right is upheld and that workers throughout the EU are adequately protected."
"Each single accident and each work-related illness constitutes a breach of a worker's fundamental rights."
"We all know there is a strong economic case, as well as good business reasons, for good health and safety in the workplace but, more importantly, the strongest argument has to be the cost to human health and the lives that can be saved."
"One life every three and a half minutes - who can argue with that?"
"(Applause)"
"- (EL) The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, Tuesday 15 January 2008, at 12 p.m."
"in writing. - (FR) I should like to begin by congratulating the European Commission on its Community strategy on health and safety at work 2007-2012, and on the work achieved by our Parliamentary Committee."
"Every year, almost 500 000 people die or suffer permanent disability for work-related reasons, and we must applaud the European Commission's goal of achieving an average 25% reduction in work-related accidents in the EU."
"I support the idea of increased activity by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao (Spain)."
"In this matter and, more generally, in the development of social Europe, I regret the fact that neither the report nor, moreover, the Communication from the European Commission stresses that it is essential to support the social partners; we must always remember that under the existing Treaties, with Articles 137 ff. of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC) (and this has been confirmed by the Lisbon Treaty that is in the process of being ratified), legislative instruments are available to the latter to facilitate the development of European social law."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"Application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community (debate)"
"(EL) On the agenda for discussion, we have the report given by Csaba Öry on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, concerning the application of social security schemes to wage-earners, non-earners and members of their families moving within the Community - C6-0104/2007 -."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, honourable members of the European Parliament, the document submitted to you today is the latest Regulation amending Regulation 1408/71."
"This is the well-known Regulation on the coordination of social security schemes."
"For more than 30 years, this Regulation has formed the basis for coordinating the national social security schemes."
"In recent years, an effort has been initiated to update and simplify this Regulation and the Regulation implementing it."
"Parliament has already approved the new Regulation 883/2004, and the remaining instruments which are required for its implementation are already under negotiation."
"These are the implementing Regulation and the text of the Annexes."
"Pending the entry into force of these new legislative instruments, it is necessary to update the validity of Regulation 1408/71."
"This new technical update is therefore submitted to you."
"It applies only to the text of the Annexes to the Regulation, and aims to take account of the changes made to the national legislations."
"It is important that this text should be approved without delay, so that Regulation 1408/71 can be updated, ensuring legal certainty and observance of citizens' rights."
"I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur Mr Őry for the cooperation between our two institutions."
"As he clearly stated in his report, a vote on this act on first reading will make it possible to adopt it without delay."
"In this spirit, the amendments have been drawn up, including the technical changes made by the Council."
"On the other hand, he has not included, at this stage, the discussions which can more fruitfully be held in the context of examining the implementing Regulation, for which the rapporteur is Mrs Lambert, or the text of the Annexes, especially Annex 11, for which the rapporteur is Mrs Bozkurt."
"There are some who would like to seize the opportunity given by this report, to address wider issues - for example, trans-border health services."
"Despite the obvious concern about these issues, I do not think it is advisable to examine them within the scope of the present technical update."
"A limited but pragmatic approach to the technical update is a better safeguard for citizens' rights."
"I would particularly like to thank Mr Őry for this."
"The Commission is in favour of amendments 1 to 6, 9 and 11, which bring the original text into line with the Council's general orientation, and in favour of amendments 7 and 8, which regulate a particular difficulty which arose recently in a Member State, the Netherlands, after the health insurance reform came into effect."
"On the other hand, the Commission is not in favour of amendment 10."
"The imprecise drafting of this amendment does not allow proper management of the specific situations which it aims to regulate."
"The amendment calls into question the rules of priority in the field of family benefits."
"Such an amendment would have legal and economic consequences far beyond the Member State concerned."
"Thank you for your attention, and once again I congratulate the rapporteur on his contribution and his excellent cooperation."
"rapporteur. - (HU) Madam President, Commissioner, allow me to say a few words about the legislation before us and its significance, before I move on to the smaller matters surrounding the proposed amendments."
"As the Commissioner said, it is true that this is very old legislation."
"It was born in 1971 and has traditionally played a prominent role ever since, as a secondary regulatory instrument for the fundamental right of freedom of employment within the Union."
"It cannot be denied that the right of free movement of labour recorded in the Treaty would be worth very little in itself if citizens looking for work in other Member States could not have access to the social security systems, or if the portability of rights could not be ensured."
"In connection with movement within the Union, workers who take significant risks must not suffer any disadvantage with regard to social security and fundamental social rights."
"Only then can free movement of labour play an important role in equalising the Union's labour markets, which the Union's economy needs."
"On the other hand, we should also see and note that Regulation 1408, which we are now discussing, can only fulfil its function if we continuously harmonise it with national legislation."
"However, questions on social policy, employment and movement of labour basically belong to and affect national competences."
"This is why it has been, and is, necessary to constantly amend and supplement the legislation from one year to the next."
"This is crucial legislation, since it looks as though we are just agreeing on different wording, but in fact this affects people, people's destinies and people's everyday problems."
"Therefore, as legislators, it is still our duty, even if we know that this text will only be in force for a very short time because, as the Commissioner has already mentioned the new Regulation and the new Directive already exist."
"They have already been born."
"Until we produce the implementing regulation, the interests of legal security require that we continuously update and adjust the wording to changes in the national legislation."
"A good example of this is the first proposed amendment, where in Hungarian law the concept of 'close dependant' was amended in the Civil Code, and now an opportunity has opened up for us to adjust the European wording to this."
"However, this also related to the proposed amendments affecting the Netherlands, where likewise it very clearly concerns people's destinies, and where there is doubt regarding entitlement to various social benefits for the families of soldiers serving abroad."
"This is clearly unacceptable and must be added."
"We did, however, find a solution to this problem during the Commission's work, by accepting the verbal proposal by the Council and incorporating it into the text."
"There is therefore no problem here, as I feel that the tenth proposed amendment mentioned has also borne a reassuring solution, since the Dutch government has undertaken to notify the relevant citizens in a clarifying circular, so there is now no need for this proposed amendment to be adopted by the Parliament."
"There was, however, a need for cooperation, so I would like to thank the participants, my fellow Members who submitted amendments, the Council and the Commission. Thank you very much for the floor, Mr President."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, as Mr Őry has just said, mobility in the employment market is of the utmost importance."
"In fact, the coordination regulation we are discussing today brings the adjustments to the laws of the Member States into line every year."
"The Member States should actually have to test every law or every amendment to social security or tax law to check whether it is also Europe-proof. Then there would not be too many problems."
"With a clear result, it would not be necessary to make adjustments later on."
"Together with Mr Őry, I have tabled a number of amendments and I think really that Members should each look at their own Member States when the time comes for the annual adjustment to see whether everything proposed in the administrative consultation has in fact been brought into line with the real situation in Europe."
"We have tabled two or three amendments."
"The first two, Amendments 7 and 8, relate to health insurance for members of the families of military personnel resident in Belgium or Germany."
"Dutch military personnel are not covered by the Health Care Insurance Act and so members of their families could not be insured either and therefore had to join a scheme that became more and more expensive."
"The Dutch Government has written to the House asking the European Parliament to adopt the amendments, because that is the quickest solution."
"The third amendment - Amendment 10 - concerns the Dutch law on child care."
"A family that lived in the Netherlands and worked on the other side of the border was not entitled to a child care allowance."
"That has also now been resolved by a change in the law."
"That means that, through our perseverance, we have achieved quite a number of things for many people."
"I am also grateful to my colleagues for not allowing themselves to be deterred by all the second reading arguments, but backing us up so that we have been able to achieve a great deal."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Őry, on his balanced report."
"Secondly, I would like to stress how important it is for the European Union's various social security schemes to be coordinated and improved, and adapted where necessary."
"It is quite clear that a number of what we consider to be essential amendments have been tabled to allow an informed debate as part of a process facilitating the approval of Mr Őry's report at first reading."
"Social security questions in Europe clearly involve much more than the problems this report seeks to resolve and the associated regulatory practices."
"The issue here, however, is to take account of the changes that have taken place in social security legislation in states such as Ireland, Hungary, Poland, the Netherlands and Austria in order to ensure effective modernisation and adaptation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as we know, discussions are in progress in parallel on the introduction of the new regulatory system, particularly the negotiation of the respective implementing regulations."
"We welcome the rapporteur's position in this case too, and we understand and share the view that only a limited number of absolutely essential amendments should be supported, as we said in committee."
"These amendments seek to guarantee the necessary legal certainty so that the new regulation can best be brought into force."
"I have meanwhile learned that Mr Őry has withdrawn the amendment concerned for the reasons explained."
"In conclusion, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is most important is to help to ensure, in the field of social security too, proper implementation of the principle of worker mobility in the European Union, which was reaffirmed at the Lisbon summit and throughout 2006, the European Year of Mobility."
"Without such mobility of labour and without proper coordination of the social security system, European workers will have limited opportunities to move in labour markets."
"That is what we do not want, and we therefore support this report."
"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees citizens' freedom of movement and residence."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union guarantees the freedom to choose an occupation and the right to engage in work."
"However, we know that in practice there are still many obstacles preventing citizens from making full use of these rights in the Community."
"Since 1971, the regulation we are discussing here has been considered the basis for guaranteeing social security for citizens moving from one Member State to another."
"The regulation, as was mentioned, has been applied for more than 30 years and its provisions are amended quite frequently with respect to national legislation."
"However, this regulation lays down the general principle that all national governments, social security institutions and even courts have to comply when applying national legislation."
"Thus it is ensured that people who make use of their right to move to other countries within the Community will not suffer when different national legislation is applied."
"Social security systems differ greatly from country to country and although the regulation is frequently amended it does not aim to unify systems but to generalise them."
"Therefore, it is gratifying that in this way it is possible to protect the most vulnerable citizens of the Community, such as women, pensioners and the disabled as well as their family members."
"I believe that this document helps to unify not only the EU Member States but also the citizens."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I earnestly urge you to vote for it."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, freedom of movement, work and residence throughout the European Union are some of the most important benefits gained by our citizens."
"For this reason their social insurance situation constitutes one of the most important issues, especially now, when there has been a movement of peoples such as has not been seen before in Europe, a migration much supported by all EU institutions."
"I understand that, taking into consideration the implementation of the amended Regulation on social security schemes (at present the 1971 Regulation is still in force), we are trying only to change that which it is necessary to change and to adapt it to the changes that have been introduced in certain countries."
"However I believe that we have not taken advantage of the opportunity that has presented itself and we have not amended the Regulation in accordance with the direction proposed in the new one."
"Even though four years have already passed since the draft of the new Regulation was approved, it has still not come into force, and the old one is now over 37 years old."
"It may be better to carry out thorough improvements to that which is already in existence than to wait for the new one, as time is passing and people are becoming impatient."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this."
"I know that this often seems like a very technical piece of work, but these rapid annual updates are important because they offer transparency for citizens about their entitlements."
"It also means that certain individuals can be covered more quickly."
"I would also like to stress - as others have done - that this is a coordination, not a harmonisation."
"Often that means that certain things which seem very reasonable are not necessarily acceptable within the coordination's very limited scope."
"I think we also need to be clear that this coordination is not intended to undermine national systems and open them up to market forces - as I think we are beginning to see, particularly in the health sphere at the moment."
"As others have mentioned, the implementing regulation for the update is in progress, but we already know that certain issues are not going to be covered."
"I think we need to find a solution for these outside the scope of this coordination, and I would urge the Commission to look at this: for example, when tax revenue is increasingly being used to underpin social security systems and people working abroad find that they are paying tax to contribute to a social security system to which they no longer have access."
"I would also urge - as Parliament did some time ago - that national practice come into line with the spirit of the regulation so that we do not find, as is happening in France at the moment, that certain individuals are now no longer able to access systems to which they have been paying because of changes in national regulations."
"(CS) Commissioner, there is no doubt that it is necessary to approve the technical changes that are proposed in the annexes to this regulation."
"By doing so we will harmonise the regulation with the new terminology in some countries."
"However, I would again like to point out that European legislation has already for several years contradicted the rulings of the European Court of Justice on more precise specifications of rules regarding the claims of patients to reimbursement for the cost of healthcare provided abroad."
"The contradiction is most marked with regard to hospital care and extends to all judgments: I would stress that it relates to all of them not just those cases where the Council has already achieved consensus."
"It is true that patients have their rights upheld if they turn to the European Court of Justice, but this legal status is not acceptable."
"I would like to remind you again of the wasted opportunity to amend by an appropriate method the claims of insured persons when preparing the new, simplified Regulation (EC) No 883/2004."
"An opportunity to amend the principles set out by the European Court of Justice in the Services Directive, which came up two years later, was also wasted."
"Now another year has begun and we are making only technical, not conceptual changes."
"The new implementing regulation may solve this issue, but it does not look that it will solve all matters, because the Council did not agree on all issues."
"In addition, the situation may be complicated because DG SANCO is now presenting a proposal for a new directive on patient mobility."
"That is why the Council can expect controversial negotiations."
"One topic that causes controversy is the dispute over subsidies."
"We can also expect further delays as regards the establishment in law of the citizens' right to have hospital care reimbursed."
"There are differences of opinion over the level of reimbursement and conditions of authorisation by an insurance company in one's country of origin."
"In my view, this situation is very undesirable from the point of view of legal certainty, accessibility and citizens' understanding of the law."
"Some countries are solving the problem by not informing their citizens about the claims granted by the judgments of the European Court of Justice."
"I am convinced that it is necessary to solve this problem as quickly as possible by amend Regulation (EC) No 883/2004."
"We should not rely on the controversial new directive on mobility from DG SANCO to secure, without further delay, compliance with the judgments."
"(NL) Mr President, I thank Mr Őry for his excellent work."
"In the short time I have to speak, I should like to underline one point."
"Not everything that is wrong with the coordination of social security systems can be blamed on the legislation."
"Many of the problems that occur are caused by the implementation of the rules, something for which the Member States themselves are responsible."
"A number of those practical problems have come to light during the work on the Őry report."
"That is precisely the case when it comes to coordination; not only must the legislation be correct, its practical application must also be consistent with it."
"I therefore welcome the fact that from time to time the Council Presidents consult with Parliament, for instance on Annexes XI and VI to Regulation No 883, on which I myself am rapporteur."
"It is certainly of the utmost importance that the work by the Council on this regulation and the annexes should be completed within this Parliament mandate."
"I wish future Council Presidents every success with that."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to support Mr Őry's report."
"It is very good that the EU is coordinating social security schemes, as, in the enlarged European Union, millions of persons work beyond the borders of their own countries."
"The most numerous of these are my own countrymen, Poles, of whom over 2 million now work in various Member States."
"From one side the fact that workers can move about freely is encouraging, but, from another, we are saddened by the ever-increasing number of instances of foreign workers being treated badly."
"In some countries instances of criminal treatment of Polish workers have come to light, forcing them into slave labour."
"Polish workers are becoming victims of racially motivated attacks."
"This has happened in the United Kingdom, and, most recently, in Germany - the Polish media have described cases of brutal attacks on Poles in the German town of Löknitz in Mecklenburg."
"These are serious events and we would expect all Member States to take more steps to protect foreign workers from exploitation and persecution"
"(HU) With the collapse of Europe's borders and changes in lifestyle, there are several million European citizens who were born in one country, have worked in one or more other countries and would like to spend their retirement in yet another country."
"They pay their social security contributions in another place than where they will reap the benefits later."
"Equality of competition conditions also requires that social security services are harmonised."
"In the long term, it is therefore inevitable that a standardised European social security system will be created, including a pension system, health insurance and welfare benefits."
"A working group of the Hungarian Socialist Party has recommended that this vision be incorporated into the long-term programme of the Party of European Socialists."
"Harmonisation will naturally take time and legal disputes, but I am sure that, in the Europe of the future, the future belongs to standardised social security."
"(BG) Mr. President, distinguished colleagues."
"For a united Europe, harmonisation of social legislation and coordination among the EU Member States in respect of social security schemes is key, since freedom of movement is one of our core values."
"Anyone wishing to work in an EU country needs to be well aware of their rights and responsibilities; similarly, Member States need to protect the social rights of their citizens and ensure most favourable working and living conditions."
"The social security status of citizens working in EU countries has a direct impact on Community welfare and on its economic performance."
"In Bulgaria, as one of the new Member States, the issue of social security is particularly topical."
"I believe that harmonisation of social security at the European level will ensure clearer and more simplified rules for European citizens."
"I support Mr. Őry's report and urge you to support it by your vote."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, the point about this document is that it will be approved quickly, with a view to strengthening legal certainty for citizens."
"We know that the regulations on modernisation and simplification are under approval, and therefore the present proposal would lose much of its point if we were to delay it."
"On the need to incorporate the recent decisions of the Court of the European Communities into our legislation, I would like to say that this is a technical matter and must be discussed within the framework of discussion of the Regulation to be enforced."
"The Commission has to a large extent already taken account of the Court's recent case-law in its proposal for trans-border healthcare, which is to be discussed soon in the Collegium of Commissioners."
"A favourable vote by the European Parliament on this document will enable the Commission to concentrate its efforts in future on updating and simplifying the texts."
"We still have a lot of work ahead of us before the new texts begin to be enforced."
"This effort will in the long term facilitate exercise of the rights of citizens moving within the European Union, and so this fundamental aim of European unification will take on a more concrete form."
"Allow me once more to express my thanks to the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done."
"rapporteur. - (HU) Thank you for the floor, Mr President."
"To close, it is perhaps worth summarising a question hiding in the background to this debate - several people have mentioned it, including Mrs Lambert and Mrs Bozkurt."
"As a matter of fact, while I was preparing this report, we never discussed any questions of content, because we always agreed on it."
"What we did discuss was where it is the competency of European legislators and where it is the competency of national legislators."
"I would like to assure you that in this case we managed to strike this very fragile balance."
"We therefore spoke to the Commission and the Council about all the proposed amendments."
"Sometimes a debate emerged eventually, and sometimes frequently, but we found the solution."
"Let this be a lucky or a good example that we can even work together from time to time if we need to."
"The fact that we do need to is evidence for us, but I also feel we should not doubt that the citizens of Europe also need us to."
"For my part, I have not tried in the report to recommend far-reaching changes to the text, simply because we are waiting for reports by Mrs Bozkurt and Mrs Lambert on Regulation 2003."
"I therefore feel that the legislation remains in force for now - we have perhaps improved on it a little - but we will continue the debate when we produce the implementing regulation, and I feel that this is right and proper."
"I would like to thank the Council, the Commission and my fellow Members again for their cooperation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) The Regulation that we are amending (No 1408/71) plays a very important part in achieving one of the four fundamental freedoms of the European Union, that is, freedom of movement."
"Free movement of labour in the European Union must not be restricted either directly, by restricting the professional categories open to the nationals of other Member States, or indirectly, by undermining the social benefits to which non-national employees are entitled."
"For this reason, the regulation proposed by the Commission with additional amendments made by Parliament will clearly specify when citizens may enjoy the special benefits granted by their State, under what circumstances these benefits may be exported, and whether other social schemes apply, so as to ensure fair treatment for non-nationals."
"Moreover, if we are to extend the categories of employment contracts used in Europe, we need a common understanding of what sole trading or self-employment entails."
"Not least, I believe that this report helps to safeguard the social rights of citizens working in another Member State."
"Removing obstacles to the recognition of social rights will lead to more mobility within the Union and increased employment."
"Consumer credit (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading of the report by Kurt Lechner, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the common position of the Council with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on consumer credit and repealing Directive 87/102/EEC (09948/2/2007 - C6-0315/2007 - 2002/0222 (COD))."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Kuneva, ladies and gentlemen, obtaining credit is a different matter from purchasing goods."
"The legal complexity of the transaction is far greater, and established national financing practices and legal traditions play a far greater part. Accordingly, public trust is often crucial in matters relating to consumer credit."
"Against this backdrop, harmonisation of the law on consumer credit has its limits and should be done cautiously and gradually."
"As the weaker party to the contract, the consumer must undoubtedly receive legal protection, but at the same time the guiding principles in this field, as in the law of obligations in general, must be freedom of contract and the personal responsibility of grown-up people, not prescription and paternalism."
"National legislators must have enough discretion to guarantee consumer protection flexibly in their own countries and to deal quickly with awkward new developments in the sphere of consumer protection."
"A body of legal provisions alone does not ensure that consumers are actually protected."
"Impact assessments would have been essential, given that consumer credit affects hundreds of millions of people."
"Legislation should be based on typical case scenarios and not on exceptions."
"In this respect, I must first of all thank the European Parliament as a whole for rejecting the Commission's totally unacceptable initial proposal and for amending it substantially and decisively at first reading."
"Secondly, I welcome wholeheartedly the new approach adopted by the Commission in its amended proposal dating from 2005, whereby only specific fundamental elements would ultimately be harmonised."
"I must, however, criticise the Council's common position."
"Instead of focusing on a sound practicable European solution, the representatives of the Member States have been introducing their own specific rules, defending them and compiling a litany of them in the compromise."
"The result is a set of provisions that create far too much red tape."
"That is no good to consumers."
"Swamping consumers with information does not help them."
"It generates considerable additional costs, which have a disproportionately strong impact on small amounts of credit."
"Accordingly, my aim from the outset was to try to streamline the rules and give national legislators more leeway."
"In this context I would like to thank my honourable colleagues, because all the votes in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection went in that same direction, and all the decisions of this House seem set to do likewise."
"Let me just cite two key examples, namely the substantial improvements and slimmed-down provisions regarding overdraft facilities and the emerging arrangement on Article 16 in respect of compensation for early repayment."
"In spite of these improvements, however, I believe that the emerging majority is only prepared to go halfway, no doubt partly influenced by the absence of consent in the Council and by the desire to bring the legislative project to a conclusion."
"I nevertheless consider it imperative that additional improvements be made if the proposal is to be judged favourably in its entirety."
"I wish to mention two other points that are important to me and to seek your approval once more."
"Firstly, the threshold at which the directive starts to apply should be raised to EUR 500."
"I am well aware that the value of that amount varies throughout Europe."
"The point, however, is not that the directive should only apply once the EUR 500 threshold has been crossed but that national legislators should retain the option of applying their own provisions from the first euro rather than being bound to restrict their action to credit of 500 euros or more."
"Secondly, consumers should have the option of waiving the prescribed explanations regarding pre-contractual information, one reason being that these explanations could hamper the internal market."
"I do believe it ought to be enough to provide the consumer with a copy of the terms of the contract in advance in order to satisfy the pre-contractual information requirement - which is, incidentally, what the Commission envisaged in its own proposal."
"That would limit the stacks of paperwork."
"Unless these changes are made, I fear that the desirable aims underlying this directive, namely to open up the single market to consumers in Europe and give them a wider range of products and options, will not be achieved."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the vote in this House on Wednesday on the Consumer Credit Directive is a very important moment for Europe's 500 million consumers."
"It will directly affect many people's lives, and it is about two critically important issues."
"The first is about consumers being able to make better-informed choices when they take out credit loans: to pay for a family wedding, a washing machine or a new car - the things of life."
"Second, it is about consumers getting more choice and a more competitive market."
"It is also a very important vote for businesses, creating a single, simple framework of rules so banks and other creditors can do business more easily across borders."
"We need to seize this opportunity to move forward."
"It is clear that the status quo is not working."
"The figures speak for themselves."
"In Europe the average consumer credit interest rate varies from around 6% in Finland, the cheapest Member State, to over 12% in Portugal."
"In Italy, credit rates are about 9.4%, in Ireland about 6.8%."
"Europe's consumer credit market is fragmented, broken down into 27 'mini markets'."
"And, in a European credit market worth EUR 800 billion, direct cross-border financial services make up only a tiny fraction - 1% - of all distance credit transactions."
"Clearly, the internal market is not functioning."
"Clearly, competition at EU level is not functioning."
"The result is that consumers are being denied choice and more competitive offers, and competitive businesses are being denied opportunities to access new markets."
"The Consumer Credit Directive is necessary to start to break open the potential of the internal market and boost competition and choice."
"There are two main aims of the Consumer Credit Directive: to provide standards - comparable information - to consumers to make informed choices, and to give businesses a single set of standards to sell competitive credit offers across borders."
"The Consumer Credit Directive focuses on transparency and consumer rights."
"I will highlight just a few of the important common elements it puts in place."
"Concerning advertising for credit loans: if there is a figure in an advertisement on credit, it will be mandatory to provide the same standard list of essential information all over the European Union."
"Most importantly, for the first time, the annual percentage rate of charges will be calculated in the same way across the European Union."
"This is a very significant step forward, so that consumers can see the real cost of credit using one single figure."
"Concerning pre-contractual information: information given to consumers for credit offers will be presented in the same standard credit information form across the EU, and it will give all the key facts and figures - from interest rates to information on charges and linked insurances."
"This will allow consumers to make a direct comparison between different offers presented in a standard, comparable way."
"The Directive also sets out two essential rights for consumers."
"Once they have concluded the credit contract, consumers will be able to withdraw from the credit without having to give any reason and without any charge."
"This right, a new feature in almost half of the Member States, will apply to all consumer credits in the European Union."
"In addition, the Consumer Credit Directive confirms the consumer's right to switch, and this must be a very stable policy line - not only in this area."
"The right to switch with the right to repay early at any time: this is a critically important issue for the Commission, to ensure fair compensation to banks and at the same time to safeguard the consumer's right to make a free choice and to proceed to a more competitive offer on the market."
"This is essential if competition is to thrive."
"I fully recognise that harmonising legislation in this very sensitive area is not an easy task, but I am convinced that markets are made by people and should be made to work for people, and I believe that we in Europe are in the business of putting people at the centre of the market, giving people the power to chose, giving businesses the power to compete, and getting the European market to work for consumers."
"I want to emphasise that, in the modern world, it is not about pitching consumers against business, but building healthy markets where consumers can choose and businesses can compete."
"I believe that the amendments put forward by the PSE and the ALDE Groups - with which the Council has agreed - constitute a fair and reasonable compromise."
"In my opinion, this is the best option in the interests of both consumers and financial services providers."
"I believe that the vote for this compromise package is a vote in favour of competitive markets, clear information and more informed consumer choice."
"It is a modest beginning in the consumer dimension of financial services, where much needs to be done."
"So I look to the Members of this House: you are the ones to speak directly, on behalf of European citizens; you have fought, for so many years, for the things that really matter to people in their daily lives."
"The task is to vote to support an agreement today on credit rules that will provide real added value to Europe's citizens in that space where they lead their lives and to send a clear signal of Europe's willingness to roll up our sleeves and work in an area that greatly concerns our citizens and businesses, large and small, today."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I wish to begin by acknowledging the huge amount of work done by the rapporteur for our group, Mr Lechner, and also to pay tribute to both the Commission and the Council for the work we have done together on what has been a difficult and sometimes controversial proposal, which, as the Commissioner has said, has gone on over a number of years."
"At its core - and here I agree completely with the Commissioner - is an extremely important proposal for Europe's consumers in the internal market."
"Consumer credit is a really important mechanism for bringing consumers into the market place."
"We want a thriving and innovative market; we want companies actively offering a wide range of products and services tailored to the need of consumers to buy specific articles, products or services."
"But, above all, we want a well-regulated market in which consumers feel confident in accessing that market and knowing that they will have the information but also the safeguards of being able to see clear contract terms."
"It is quite clear in financial services that good regulation encourages market activity, and that is what we have been seeking throughout this process."
"However, the problem we have had with this Directive is the fact that the consumer credit market across the European Union is at very different stages of development: many countries, like my own, already have well-developed regulation."
"The original idea of a maximum harmonisation would have meant that consumers in those countries would have been disadvantaged, and it has been trying to get that balance right that has occupied us."
"I just want to correct one impression that I think Ms Kuneva gave, perhaps unintentionally: the package of compromise amendments on the table is supported with one exception only by this group."
"We have tabled the same amendments; it is a consensual position across Parliament."
"I think there is one aspect that we are still arguing about, but I am sure we will get there and then we will have a good and important package."
"However, the important thing is that we keep monitoring the evolution of this market, ensure that it develops in a responsible way and deal with some of the problems that might arise from the evolution and development of that market."
"I am confident that this House will rise to its responsibilities and we will come up with a good package tomorrow."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and previously the Committee on Legal Affairs, have always recognised the potential benefits, to both businesses and consumers, of developing an internal market and consumer credit."
"I was present during the gestation of this legislation and hope to be there tomorrow for the final delivery, as it were, of the new consumer credit baby!"
"The last five years of discussion and debate have demonstrated fundamental differences between the Commission and Parliament, and more specifically between the Member States, on the best way to achieve this, and I firmly believe there are lessons to be learned from that."
"All proposals - even a modified Commission proposal - have to undergo a rigorous impact assessment to enable all parties and stakeholders to evaluate the merits of the proposals and to engender consumer confidence and business confidence."
"It is regrettable that neither the Commission nor the Council was prepared to do this at the time."
"However, our job today is to address the new text, which is a vast improvement on the original proposal."
"It focuses on the essential elements and components for starting to open the market and for protecting the consumer."
"Its benefits include enabling consumers to compare offers of credit, obliging lenders to assess the credit-worthiness of the consumer - which will be important in the fight against debt across the EU - and obliging lenders to provide explanations and, as a result of our amendments, all creditors will now be responsible for providing comprehensive and standard information in a simplified format."
"I welcome the 14-day withdrawal right and the right to early repayment, which are good elements for engendering consumer confidence and encouraging them to look beyond their home market for credit offers."
"This is not just about opening the market, and the fact that we now have free movement of labour and people across 27 EU Member States gives this law new significance."
"For example, a Polish plumber working in France or Germany and borrowing from a credit institution there can now obviously compare the different offers on APR in the knowledge that he has the standard information enabling him to take the right decision."
"Finally, I welcome the fact that the Commission, by exempting credit unions from this law, is not strangling small Community providers with red tape."
"I also welcome the Member State flexibility there is now."
"This has, for example, enabled a high level of protection to be maintained for consumers in the UK, which will now retain the right to joint and several liability for credit cards."
"There is therefore enough flexibility in this proposal to make it work, and I would urge Members to lend it their support."
"As chair of the Committee, I think that our work does not finish here ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, this is normally the time of year we all wish one another a 'Happy New Year'."
"However, in the UK, and globally, the news this new year has been dominated by worries over the economy, and particularly over consumer credit."
"It is not just a question of normal post-Christmas depression; we all know that it goes much deeper than that."
"Credit is going to be a difficult issue for the foreseeable future, for both lenders and borrowers alike."
"As legislators confronted with that global backdrop, we need to do something."
"We need to stimulate the EU's market in financial services, while on the other hand ensuring that our consumers make sensible and informed choices, and that all the information and the comparators are available to them in order to do so."
"Many of us in this House, and particularly in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Affairs, have spent the last couple of years sitting on an enquiry by Parliament into the demise of the British insurer, Equitable Life."
"We know what the consequences are for consumers, in the context of financial services, if we get the cross-border regulatory regime wrong."
"In this instance we need such a regime and we need to get it right, particularly in view of the global circumstances we are facing."
"This directive can help."
"It can help Europe's market in financial services at a difficult time, and it can empower and assist our consumers in obtaining credit and doing so competitively."
"My group has signed up to and put forward, with the PSE, a package that we hope will be agreed."
"It seems to us that, at the end of the day, we are faced with an argument that is almost about one word, in one article, after seven years of negotiating and drafting."
"It would be a pretty poor affair for this House and for Europe's institutions if we cannot overcome that and deliver this directive, which will, hopefully, bring to the European market all the benefits we have heard outlined."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - I support the need to update EU legislation in this area."
"The last time we had a directive on this was in 1987, and certainly the consumer credit market has changed dramatically since then."
"This EU Directive on Consumer Credit Loans seeks to introduce a greater level of competition into the EUR 800 billion consumer credit market."
"It will bring legal certainty to consumers, which is absolutely vital if people are to shop around and look for the best product which suits their needs."
"It will also help business to compete."
"When you look at the differences in consumer credit rates around Europe - from 6% in some countries up to 12% in others - it surely is time that the consumer got a better choice."
"These new rules will make the market more transparent for consumers and business competitors alike."
"The main effect of this Directive will be to provide comparable and standard information to consumers across the EU who take out loans."
"For credit offers, the information given to consumers, whether it is interest rates, numbers and frequency of payments, must be set out in a new EU-wide European credit information form."
"So I very much welcome this."
"I think that it is vital for consumers that they have confidence and that there is legal certainty in this area, but I believe that this will bring greater competition in this area and will, at the end of the day - as has already been pointed out - give more choice to consumers, and that the consumers will benefit greatly from this Directive."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must regrettably adopt a directive tomorrow which does not meet our own criterion of better regulation."
"There has been no impact assessment, even though this is an entirely new proposal, in spite of the intervening enlargement of the EU with the accession of 12 new Member States, in spite of major differences between Member States in financing practices and regulatory systems and in spite of social disparities within Member States."
"Instead of complete harmonisation, there was an urgent need to give the Member States greater freedom of action."
"The Member States can respond quite differently and far more quickly today to the various new models that appear on the market on a daily basis."
"The Member States are also better equipped to respond to a financial crisis."
"They can regulate matters in a shorter time frame than it takes the European Union to act."
"This is why it would have been wise to confine ourselves here to minimal harmonisation instead of trying to harmonise as much as possible."
"That is the criticism we have to make of this consumers' directive."
"Moreover, we also deplore the fact that numerous opt-out clauses have had to be adopted in order to get all the Member States on board."
"This, unfortunately, has done nothing at all for the rigour of the provisions."
"There is also, however, one exemption for which we would argue, and it relates to renovation loans."
"In view of the formidable challenges posed by climate change, there is an urgent need to exempt from this proposal renovation loans secured by mortgage, which have nothing to do with consumer credit but should be treated as mortgage loans."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Mr President, when rules are laid down as to how an agreement between two parties is to be drafted, account must of course be taken of whether the parties have equal status or whether one party has an advantage over the other from the outset."
"If one party has an advantage, this must be taken into account in the way the agreement is drafted and a formula must be devised which strengthens the weaker party."
"When it is a case of consumer credit, which is what we are discussing now, it is the person needing credit who is in the less favourable position."
"Unfortunately neither the rapporteur nor the compromise proposal take sufficient account of this responsibility, of consumers' rights and consumer protection."
"This is particularly serious since it is invariably those with the least financial resources who seek purchase credit."
"I also want to say that, despite the fact that we have a decision requiring gender mainstreaming in all our work here in Parliament, no gender analysis of this directive has been carried out, also despite the fact that we know that many women on the lowest wages are precisely those who often get caught in the debt trap."
"I maintain that there must be a ceiling on the level of compensation to be paid in the event of the early repayment of loans."
"I also maintain that a three-day cooling-off period is far too short."
"Besides, I want minimum harmonisation, not maximum harmonisation."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I wonder if I might perhaps offer a few words of wisdom here."
"I have spent most of my life in merchant banking, albeit not retail banking, and I have to say I do not regard it as the business of politicians to come between a consumer, or a lender, and a borrower."
"I would not dream of trying to regulate on this subject, with all my experience."
"I look down the list of people who actually serve on this committee and in this Parliament and I do not see a great deal of experience there, so it is a question of the blind leading the blind."
"I think that this place, which has not managed to audit its own books for nearly 11 years, commenting on this is slightly absurd."
"The fact that you can actually have rules for Bucharest, London and Paris and consumers in those places is absolutely ludicrous."
"Perhaps I could warn people like the UK Government that bailing out banks to the tune of 50% of their entire reserves is fundamentally wrong."
"So, if I may, let me give one tip to the consumer: 'never a lender or a borrower be', and to governments, let me say: 'a fool and his money are soon parted'!"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur and, of course, the Commissioner too, who has played a highly constructive role in this complex matter."
"Mrs Wallis referred to the fact that this dossier has been what I like to call haunting the corridors of the European Parliament and the other European institutions for more than seven years, and in my opinion these have not been seven years of transparent legislating or seven years of better regulation but a muddle that very few Members of this House have yet managed to untangle."
"In this respect I do not believe we have done any great favours to the European consumers and citizens who have had to watch this backstage wrangling among the Member States, but if this final outcome provides greater transparency for consumers who wish to buy a car, for example, enabling them to make an informed choice between a hire-purchase agreement and a personal loan, I believe it will be useful."
"Reference was made here to the fact that the European credit market is worth EUR 800 billion and that the differential between the highest and the lowest interest rates is about 6%."
"There is, of course, a lot of mileage in this, and it is to be hoped that consumers will be able to benefit from the available scope too, but I have good reason to be sceptical."
"The fact is that a consumer who wants to buy a digital camera for EUR 220 and then has to complete a ten-page credit form in writing will scarcely be able to comprehend all the risks involved in a credit transaction for EUR 220."
"The result, in my view, is that much of what is meant well in this package will not ultimately help the average vulnerable consumer but will create such difficulties for consumers that they will even prefer not to buy anything on credit terms to avoid the daunting task of completing the extensive set of forms."
"That remains my view, and I hope that the variations in interest rates will become more transparent for consumers and that this will be of benefit, although I still believe that the preceding process has been unacceptable."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I believe we must see this through so that consumers and banks know what will and will not apply to them in future."
"I believe the compromise which we developed last week and which the Liberals have now endorsed too is a thoroughly reasonable one and that we have come up with a common solution which is tenable and consumer-friendly."
"That is the main thing."
"If I may take issue with Mr Schwab, first of all the form is not ten pages long, and secondly I consider it a very good thing that we have a common form in which the consumer must be told clearly and transparently the total amount of the credit, the term of the agreement, the rules governing the right of withdrawal and the applicable annual percentage rate, which might then be calculated on the same common basis in all Member States."
"That is transparency, and this transparency is what we need and what is at stake in tomorrow's vote on the proposal contained in amendment 46."
"I hope we can ensure that transparency really does win the day."
"Forgive my saying so, but while the rapporteur has unquestionably worked hard, my group cannot condone this Parliament of ours being railroaded into a situation in which the Council suddenly appears to be consumer-friendlier than the European Parliament."
"My group regards this purely and simply as an unacceptable state of affairs, which is why we must ensure that a fair balance is struck between the natural right of the banks to do business - a normal feature of any market economy - and the need to protect consumers by ensuring that they are given the information they need to choose the right form of credit and reject unfavourable options."
"That is the way to go, and that is what we should adopt tomorrow."
"(NL) Mr President, I should first like to thank Mr Lechner for his drafting and his constructive cooperation."
"I should also like to thank the Commissioner and the Council, because it was a lengthy trialogue."
"Unfortunately we were not able to reach a compromise, but we were only a hairsbreadth away from one, so I am pleased that on Wednesday morning we shall be voting on that same compromise and I am assuming we shall achieve it."
"Why?"
"We have in fact been talking about it for seven years already."
"If we want to have any political credibility with the market and our citizens, with consumers but also with the sector and the industry. it is important for us to take a decision at last."
"A compromise is always give and take and of course there are aspects that could be improved, but that applies to all parties."
"The fact is that a compromise is mixing water with wine and then you get a result and you have to be satisfied with it."
"I believe that the present plan is in the interests of both consumers and the financial sector."
"That is what we have to work towards, that is in the interests of Europe and the internal market."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, which no doubt required considerable patience, but has doubtless brought him considerable satisfaction."
"This report can certainly be counted as being one of the most controversial and most difficult compromises."
"Its objective is to bring more closely together different regulations in various EU countries, which really are very different, and legislation in this area is largely under the control of Member States."
"Harmonisation in this sector is quite simply impossible."
"We can only try to introduce a partial convergence of requirements, and even this, as we have seen over the past months, has caused considerable problems."
"I agree with the approach taken by the rapporteur, that in an area as difficult as this Member States should be given as free a hand as possible."
"This seems to be the only sensible solution to enable such a difficult and weighty report to be accepted by all interested parties."
"It would appear that, in its present form, the text has been simplified."
"What can be seen in all the work over this report is the lack of an analysis of impacts, and such an analysis would certainly have improved its quality."
"Overall, this draft seems to me to be satisfactory."
"Obviously this version is far from being ideal, but it has been adapted to the current situation in Member States."
"This proposal will abolish financial and administrative burdens on consumers and will, in my opinion, introduce important provisions to protect the consumer, making it easier to obtain credit."
"One of the most useful proposals is the introduction of comparisons."
"(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I personally cannot share the enthusiasm for this text."
"Important steps have been taken, but this text does not serve the purpose, which is to create a harmonised framework."
"That harmonised framework has not been achieved on a number of points that we consider essential."
"Let me explain."
"There are two points that, as far as our delegation is concerned, are still difficult or very difficult."
"The pre-contractual information package is reinforced and harmonised. That is good."
"But it is undermined by the various formulae that are allowed for the annual percentage rate of charge for opening credit."
"I just need an explanation of how consumers are going to be able to compare those various formulae objectively."
"Secondly, in the case of my country, Belgium, the position of consumers is likely to be weakened, in that the database has to be consulted but there are no related sanctions for the banks."
"That could plunge people even further into debt."
"I also think it is a missed opportunity for the banks themselves."
"It is still a wasted regulation."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the Commission's well-intentioned attempt to establish a functioning internal market with enhanced consumer rights in the realm of consumer credit."
"The result of its efforts, however, must honour the pledge made to consumers by offering them a wider choice, better terms and conditions in the wake of increasing competition and less red tape."
"Judged by that standard, the final draft directive on consumer credit is unsatisfactory in many respects."
"Firstly, the prescribed standard information, which runs to some eight pages, is too extensive."
"I doubt whether customers will actually use it to inform themselves of the detailed terms and conditions."
"In practice, this is a tangible increase in red tape, for which consumers will have to pay at the end of the day."
"Secondly, the provisions on early credit repayment squander the opportunity to let consumers share in any windfall that might accrue to the creditor because of a favourable change in interest rates after the lending date."
"Thirdly, the compromise that has been reached will effectively put an end to overdraft facilities, which are standard practice in Germany and widely used elsewhere."
"The public will deeply regret this and will have one more reason to gripe about the Brussels Moloch."
"What counts is quality, not quantity."
"(SK) I would like to thank the rapporteur, Kurt Lechner, for the exacting work he did when drawing up this report."
"He managed to simplify the Council's overcomplicated and bureaucratic proposal through new amendments."
"I would like to take the opportunity presented by the presence of Commissioner Kuneva at this discussion, which is important to European consumers, to draw attention once again to the important role of consumer organisations, which must be able to play their rightful role in every Member State and receive adequate support from the Commission."
"To improve the quality of consumer protection, the individual consumer bodies require additional finance to be able to educate consumers and provide independent advice on consumer credit, notably to the most vulnerable consumer groups."
"Commissioner, although you have achieved much encouraging progress for consumer groups and although your arrival gave the green light to consumer protection, I would ask for your help again in 2008."
"- (LT) I welcome the appearance of this directive; it is a step in the right direction."
"However, I would like to draw your attention - in particular the Commissioner's attention - to Article 16."
"In my country, consumers do not receive any compensation if they repay credit early."
"Now, when this article comes into force, consumers will actually pay more."
"I find it hard to believe that this denotes consumer protection."
"Surely, it is said that there are plenty of legal protectors in the article intended to ensure that consumers do not have to pay for this, but when we talk about legal protectors we mean legal games and not the real economy."
"In the real economy, if it is possible to tax a consumer, he or she will always be taxed."
"Therefore, I ask you to take care to structure Article 16 better in view of the fact that in many countries this tax is not applied at all."
"Mr President, I think we have managed to get quite a good result in the recent negotiations."
"What we have not managed to improve is simplicity."
"I think that now there is far too much information for an ordinary consumer in Europe."
"Whenever the Council members and Member States request more derogations from the standard information, it makes this whole directive more complex."
"I think that standard information really should be standard."
"It should be an EU level playing field."
"Every time that we in Parliament or Member States in the Council say that we should have different adaptive rules by the Member States we make this issue more complex."
"I totally agree with the Commission's objective."
"Probably the compromise negotiations are headed in the right direction, but something should be done about the simplicity issue before this directive gets into the books and reaches consumers."
"(FR) Mr President, colleagues, Commissioner, I should like to make just a few observations."
"I think it is good for our Parliament's image to show European consumers that we have the protection of their interests in hand."
"Mr Lechner's report certainly reflects a tremendous amount of work, on which I congratulate him, but I think that the task now, in the final stage of the process, is to strike a compromise that will enable us to demonstrate the importance that we as parliamentarians ascribe to the consumer."
"It would be rather hard to swallow if the Council were portrayed at the end of the day as the consumer's best defender."
"We need to find a compromise over the few words that divide us, in order to avoid a conciliation procedure which, I believe, would be in no-one's interest."
"We also need to avoid taking retrograde steps, and the fact is that consumers in France, like those in Lithuania, are not financially penalised for early repayment."
"We cannot present consumers with a situation less advantageous than that which they currently enjoy under national legislation."
"If there are no other speakers, let me remind Members that they may use the 'catch the eye' procedure to ask for the floor again if they believe they did not complete their first statement."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Lechner, and to all Honourable Members for raising a lot of important and wise remarks."
"Let me just comment on a few of them."
"We believe that the threshold is set up very carefully."
"Our common aim is not to deprive vulnerable consumers of protection by directive."
"That is why we set up a threshold which equally embedded the interests of the new countries and which does not exclude most average credits in the EU-12."
"It is also, we believe, a big advantage to have a standard info-sheet, which many of you have pointed out as one of the main positive steps in the directive."
"This will be one of the biggest advantages and we will not deprive the consumers if we substitute it for the contract copy, because consumers cannot easily compare copies of the contract."
"They often have difficulties understanding the contract copies - and this is borne out by Eurobarometer research."
"As to full harmonisation - actually I would like to stress that this is 'targeted' full harmonisation. The reason why it is better than minimum harmonisation, as some of you proposed to discuss even today, is that we think that it is necessary to lower market-entry barriers for financial services providers, and this is one of the main reasons why this proposal for a directive is going ahead."
"Through this, we need to increase consumer confidence."
"That is why targeted full harmonisation is the best way to do it."
"The Commission would like to reassure Mr Harbour especially that it will monitor the market."
"My services have launched a study to collect indicators and data on the present market."
"A few years later we will use the same indicators and collect the same data."
"This will allow us to decide on the follow-up."
"To conclude, I can only repeat that in my view, going through the conciliation procedure would not help us reach a better compromise than the one you have on the table today."
"Consequently, I very much hope that Parliament will be able to adopt this text at second reading tomorrow."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has emerged clearly in the debate that we have a common aim."
"In particular, I can unreservedly endorse what the Commissioner said in her introductory remarks."
"The only question is whether the draft that is now on the table can actually achieve our common objectives."
"I believe there are a number of defensible opinions on this issue."
"The uniform annual percentage rate of charges certainly represents unmitigated progress, as does the common uniform right of withdrawal."
"Let me re-emphasise, however, that consumer protection is best served if we consider the whole picture, as the Commissioner rightly indicated, rather than tacking together all the provisions that apply anywhere in Europe."
"More statutory provisions do not mean greater protection of consumers."
"On the subject of interest-rate differentials in Europe, I must point out that I should have welcomed the presentation of an analysis of the extent to which these differentials might be due to divergent legal provisions and complexities in particular countries and whether it might be the case that interest rates are lower where legal rules are simpler."
"I do not know the answer, but the question ought to have been examined."
"Competition and general consumer education also serve to enhance consumer protection, but excessively convoluted rules do not."
"Let me say a brief word on the trialogue. I certainly held the view that we should thrash out our differences here in Parliament."
"Far be it from me to thwart an agreement."
"Nevertheless, since we always argue for transparency, particularly in the Council but in other forums too, I do not think it right that an informal body should hold these discussions behind closed doors. Instead, each institution should initially express its opinion, motions should be tabled, and a solution should then be found on that basis."
"Let me repeat once again that the draft has been considerably improved in the course of more than six years of deliberations - I want to make that abundantly clear - and Parliament has played a crucial part in the improvement process."
"I also see this to some extent as an endorsement of my own work."
"In my opinion, however, the draft is simply not good enough."
"Be that as it may, it will enter into force."
"I have no hesitation in thanking my fellow Members, the Commission and indeed the Council - which, in point of fact, has always provided very straight answers and detailed information - for their contribution to the performance of what has generally been a thoroughly gratifying and pleasant task."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 16 January 2008, at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - Parliament's vote on this very important dossier means are now one step closer to fully implementing the four freedoms."
"This directive will bring more rights and transparency to consumers when taking a consumer credit."
"Comparing credit conditions across borders and choosing the best offer will now become much easier than before."
"After five years of preparations, the directive will apply to all unsecured loans between EUR 200 and EUR 75 000."
"I want to point out that it is important to set the lower threshold at EUR 200, since loans do not often exceed EUR 500, especially in the new Member States."
"The consumer will benefit not least from all contractual information, a common method for the calculation of the annual percentage rate and a 14 day withdrawal period."
"Balanced laws like this help us to achieve the approval of the citizens for the European Union."
"in writing. - An EU directive on consumer credit has been talked about for some time, so today's debate on the directive is to be welcomed."
"There is great hope that the directive will lead to consumers looking beyond their own national boundaries for loans - allowing them to shop around for the cheapest loan available."
"It should, when implemented and taken up by EU citizens, lead to people availing of cheaper credit."
"But this is the key to its success: firstly knowledge among EU citizens of the possibility of availing of loans across borders, and secondly a willingness of citizens to take up this option."
"At present, it is clear that there is a reluctance among citizens to shop around within their own Member State for best value in loans, just as there is still some resistance among consumers to change banking institutions, though that may be changing slowly."
"The success or otherwise of this directive depends on its effective implementation by Member States."
"Only time will tell if it lives up to our expectations and provides greater choice to consumers, greater availability of consumer loans and most importantly lower costs on such loans."
"in writing. - Consumer credits are an essential pillar of the internal market."
"First of all, I think this directive is a first step and a good example of how the EU delivers concrete results, even in such a controversial issue."
"Second, in my opinion in the longer term further harmonisation is needed once we have gathered experience on the working of this directive so as to make it easier for consumers to shop across borders and to give full legal certainty to businesses on their obligations when offering these credits in other Member States."
"Third, I want to thank all the people involved for their perseverance in this process, which has lasted for years."

"- Before the vote:"
"(EL) Mr President, my dear colleagues, as we know, the European Commission's original proposal included in a single Regulation the amended proposal for Regulation No 11 abolishing discrimination in prices and terms of transport, and the amendment to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs."
"The Commission's proposal was based on Articles 75, 152 and 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and the stipulated procedure for adopting the Resolution was co-decision."
"The colegislators - Council and Parliament - decided to split the original proposal into two separate Regulations: one for the amendment of Regulation No 11 on transport, based on Article 75 (3), which does not provide for any intervention by the European Parliament in the legislative procedure, and on which the Committee on Transport gave its opinion; and another Regulation concerning amendment of the Regulation on the hygiene of foodstuffs, based on Articles 95 and 152 (4b), on which the Committee on the Environment is to give its opinion shortly."
"Today we are called upon to decide whether Article 75 (3) provides an adequate legal basis for amending the Regulation on transport. The amendment to Article 852/2004, as we have said, will be discussed later."
"The proposed Regulation which is submitted today provides for the deletion of Article 5, which ceased to be valid in 1961, and an amendment to Article 6, aimed at reducing the carriers' administrative obligations by abolishing their obligation to retain copies showing full price information, since this information is included anyway on the consignment notes and in the carriers' accounting systems."
"This amendment makes it possible to check transport rates and conditions, and identify any discrimination."
"So this is an amendment that corresponds exactly to what is provided for in Article 75 (3), second sentence, of the Treaty of the European Communities, and since the amendment to Article 6 is necessary to enable European authorities to check observance of the principle of non-discrimination in the field of transport under Article 75 (3) of the Treaty, the Committee on Legal Affairs made the point that Article 75 (3) is the only legal basis than can be used when amending Regulation No 11."

"Voting time"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, on a point of order, under Rule 160 of the Rules of Procedure, our group has requested that we have roll-call votes today on everything, and I know that has excited some interest in the Chamber."
"Just by way of explanation, not just this group but many MEPs from all groups are deeply concerned about the method of voting that takes place in here."
"In fact, you yourself in the chair just a few months ago said we have made mistakes here, which, in a vote of this size, are statistically normal."
"We would argue that when we are voting on legislation there should not be any possibility of mistakes being made."
"Perhaps I would ask Members, when they are going through this lengthy roll-call procedure, to consider just how important voting is, and perhaps in the light of that we will get MEPs next month, when we vote on the EU Lisbon Treaty, to vote for an amendment to allow those 10 countries that promised their own people a referendum, the opportunity to do so."
"(DE) Mr President, I have only one request."
"Rule 159 of the Rules of Procedure states that 'Normally Parliament shall vote by a show of hands'."
"For this reason it would be right to examine whether the IND/DEM Group's motion to have all votes taken by roll call is consistent with the Rules of Procedure."
"I believe it is not."
"May I ask that this be done by tomorrow."
"I believe we shall be voting today as stipulated in the voting list, but I would ask that the question of legal admissibility be reviewed by tomorrow."
"(IT) Mr President, two things: I think the television camera set up here should be moved to allow Mr Donnici - and all of us - to see the presidency and other colleagues."
"Let me also take this opportunity to welcome the decision by the European Parliament's Bureau to dedicate Parliament's press room to Anna Politkovskaya."
"The House Rules of Procedure state that voting is normally to be by show of hands unless a roll-call vote is specifically requested."
"When voting by show of hands it may so happen, not often but from time to time, and only from time to time, that either because MEPs do not raise their hands or because there is some confusion, the presidency makes a mistake when assessing the outcome of a vote."
"Should that happen then, again frequently, an MEP will request verification and as a result the President holds a roll-call vote to that end and the situation is resolved."
"This is all, therefore, provided for, and our votes proceed perfectly correctly 99.9% of the time."
"In any event, the President of the Parliament received a letter from Mr Booth MEP noting this issue and requesting action to be taken on it."
"This matter will be discussed at the Conference of Presidents and, of course by the working group looking at reform of the House's working methods."
"This is in train."
"Please be assured therefore, Mr Farage, that we are going to pay a great deal of attention to this matter and are seeking to ensure that things run more smoothly every day."
"Mr Swoboda, we are going to vote today by roll call, which is also in accordance with the Rules of Procedure as a roll-call vote has been requested by a political group."
"Today."
"And from today we will take decisions."
"Mr President, on that very point, during the last parliamentary term, a group chaired by Mr Corbett, from the PSE Group, submitted proposals to the House to the effect that, if more than 100 amendments were tabled at the plenary stage, then the report in question should be sent back to committee."
"There have now been a number of occasions when that has not taken place."
"I wonder if, when recommending to the Conference of Presidents that it look into these matters, you could also recommend it consider the very good recommendations which Mr Corbett brought forward during the last parliamentary term."
"Mr President, pursuant to Rule 145, I would just like to make a personal statement."
"Yes, I have written to the President of Parliament complaining about the voting, as you know."
"I have updated him several times since then, because my request for full electronic voting was turned down by the committee."
"Its response was 'no follow-up'."
"I have, in fact, written several times."
"The worst case that I have reported was overturned from 'rejected' to 'approved' by 567 votes to 17, with 18 abstentions."
"That is why I have called this system ludicrous in the past."
"It really must be dealt with."
"Formal sitting - Grand Mufti of Syria"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is a special honour and pleasure for me today, in this European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, to extend a warm welcome to the European Parliament to His Eminence Sheikh Ahmad Badr El Din El Hassoun, Grand Mufti of Syria."
"(Applause)"
"As I emphasised last week in Ljubljana at the opening ceremony for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, the European Parliament attaches great importance to this year of dialogue between cultures."
"I am firmly convinced, as are many others, that it is both possible and essential for people from different cultures and religions to live together in peace, both within the European Union and in the world at large. Particular importance attaches in this context to our relations with the peoples on the opposite shores of the Mediterranean and in the Middle East."
"The fact is that the fruits of this dialogue will have a lasting effect on our common future."
"Together we must build an intellectual and cultural bridge across the Mediterranean, embedded in mutual enrichment and shared values."
"We build this bridge when we engage in continuous, honest and open dialogue in which we listen to each other, exchange our opinions frankly and develop mutual understanding."
"Tolerance is at the heart of intercultural dialogue."
"Tolerance does not mean indifference."
"Tolerance means putting forward our own points of view and hearing and respecting other people's convictions."
"Where we find it impossible to accept another person's point of view, it is still necessary to treat such views with respect, to exchange ideas and opinions peacefully and, wherever possible, to pave the way for joint action and thereby defuse tension."
"We must stress the things we have in common, including the substance of universal democratic values."
"Foremost among these are human dignity and the defence of inalienable human rights."
"In the course of 2008 and thereafter, the European Parliament will take several opportunities to engage in such talks."
"Today's visit by the Grand Mufti of Syria represents the first of these opportunities."
"Ahmad Badr El Din El Hassoun, formerly Mufti of Aleppo, is regarded as an outstanding champion of inter-faith dialogue in a country where the religious communities in all their diversity still live and work together in peace."
"This is clearly symbolised by the fact that the Grand Mufti is accompanied on today's visit by high-ranking religious leaders. That was his express wish, and may I make special mention of Bishop Antoine Audo, head of the Chaldean Catholic Church in Syria, and bid him a warm welcome."
"Your Eminence, it now gives me great pleasure to invite you to address the European Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, your applause shows that this House is at one with me in sincerely thanking the Grand Mufti of Syria, Sheikh Ahmad Badr El Din El Hassoun, for his message of opposition to violence, war and terrorism."
"Human dignity is central to him, and that is the basis for cooperation between cultures. His is a tolerance which says that we have our own point of view, that we are not bound to embrace another's point of view, but we respect it and therefore live together peacefully in this world, recognising human dignity."
"Thank you, Your Eminence, for your address to us here in the European Parliament."
"(Applause)"

"Mr President, I rise under Rules 152 and 160 of the Rules of Procedure, concerning voting procedure and roll call votes."
"It is obvious that the Rules of Procedure have been abused and used in a way utterly contrary to their intention."
"Could I ask, through you, that specialists such as Mr Corbett and others look very carefully at what has happened today?"
"My understanding is that the President has the discretion to rule that any request for a roll-call vote be declared invalid."
"That may become a necessity when we have heavier voting sessions in the future."
"(DE) Mr President, in this House we have very liberal and, in particular, minority-friendly Rules of Procedure, and rightly so."
"It is our wish and our duty to preserve them."
"This, however, presupposes that the various groups exercise their minority rights properly and do not abuse them."
"When that happens - as it has done today - we should rethink this practice."
"Mr President, I must take exception to the two points of order just made."
"The rules are absolutely clear on this."
"Every group has the right to request roll-call votes."
"No discretionary power is given to the Chair."
"We have always accepted that, ultimately, in any democratic chamber the majority has the right to get its way, but what we have just heard is the most intolerant position that does not allow any opposition, that does not allow any dissenting view and, if my colleagues want to understand why the European Union is so unpopular with the voters out there, you need only consider your own intolerant attitude towards anyone expressing any view other than your own."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Hannan, to my knowledge, all votes which have taken place this morning have been by roll call."
"Therefore the Rules have been complied with meticulously."
"Mr President, I wish to point out to Mr Beazley and Mr Rack, and perhaps to yourself, Mr President, that today is the first time since I have sat in the European Parliament that we can actually be confident that the results are right, because normally it is a farce!"
"So do not moan at us, we are helping you to tidy up this place so that in the future more of this work is done in committee and we are not given hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of amendments."
"What we have done is entirely within the Rules and all of you - in particular those who believe in this place - should learn a lesson from it."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I rise under Rule 171 of the Rules of Procedure and table the following motion on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament: in view of the urgent need to discuss the Rules of Procedure and their interpretation, I move that the sitting be suspended as of now and that all further debates, including the explanations of vote, be postponed until ten o'clock this evening."
"(Applause)"
"Fourteen MEPs in the House have requested explanations of votes for each of the seven debates held yesterday and this morning."
"Fourteen MEPs, each of whom has requested an explanation on each of the seven debates: ten are members of the IND/DEM Group, two of the PPE-DE Group and two are Non-attached."
"If these explanations of vote take place now they will probably take up about two hours of our time."
"Therefore I submit the following point of order to the House: either we take the explanations of vote and stay here for two hours more or we suspend the session now as proposed by Mr Schulz and hold the explanations of vote tonight."
"(The House agreed to this proposal.)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, notification of the timing explanations of vote will be given at 3 p.m."
"Voting time (continuation)"
"The next item is voting time."
"(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Mr President, very briefly, I do not think you actually followed the Rules of Procedure correctly during the earlier voting session."
"You said 'the voting is now open', but you did not ask 'have all Members voted?' before saying 'the voting is closed', and you did not read out the results."
"I think you were out of order."
"Mr Booth, the result of the vote is on the screen."
"As you have asked for all today's votes to be roll-call votes, that is what we are doing; what I am trying to do is to make this form of voting as painless as possible for the House, if that is all right with you, Mr Booth."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Agenda"
"(FR) Colleagues, I have to remind you that 19 Members have requested time for oral explanations of vote on each of the seven reports that were adopted before lunch."
"There are a further 10 individual requests for explanations of vote."
"Theoretically the time required for explanations of vote would thus be 143 minutes, something more than two hours."
"In order to be able to take these explanations of vote today, I therefore propose the following change in the order of business:"
"We would take the Commission's statement on waste in the Campania region, which is currently scheduled for 9 p.m., immediately after the Angelilli report on the rights of the child."
"The explanations of vote would then be taken during the evening sitting, after the oral question on the status of elected MEPs in Poland."
"The order of business would thus be as follows:"
"from 3 to 5.30 p.m.: Cashman report, Angelilli report, then the Commission statement on waste in the Campania region,"
"from 5.30 to 7 p.m.: Commission Question Time,"
"then during the evening sitting from 9 p.m. to midnight we would have, in order: the Pack report, the Graefe zu Baringdorf report, the oral question on the status of elected MEPs in Poland and finally the explanations of vote on those items put to the vote before lunch."
"Mr President, on a point of order, for clarification of the Rules as they were ruled upon earlier today."
"Under Rule 171, invoked by Mr Schulz, about the suspension of the sitting, it does not say - because we had finished the votes and were before an explanation of vote - that the rule could be invoked at that particular time."
"If the sitting was then suspended, it is precedent in this House that, when you resume the sitting, you continue with the business, and continuing with the business - based on precedent in this House and what we have done in the eight years I have been here - would be the explanations of vote."
"I am quite happy to come back here at whatever time is necessary to give my explanations of vote, because I want to do that for a number of reports."
"I would ask you what the basis of the ruling on Rule 171 was, because I do not think that was in order; you know you are twisting the Rules, as well as I do here, to go against the democratic wills of some Members of this House."
"It is a strange type of democracy when you are trying to silence a minority who are just doing what they are allowed to do within the Rules of Procedure."
"(FR) Colleagues, allow me to remind you of a few basic facts about how we operate here."
"The President can suspend the sitting at any time."
"I merely have to get up - to rise from this seat - and the proceedings will be suspended automatically."
"Rest assured, please, that I have no intention of rising from my seat, but do be aware that all it takes for the proceedings to be suspended is that the President should get up."
"So my first point is this: the proceedings were suspended because it rests entirely within the President's power to suspend the sitting when he or she chooses to do so."
"A second absolute rule is the following: this is the plenary session and only the plenary session has control - total control - over its agenda."
"That is why I am proposing to you that you amend the order of business along the lines I have just suggested."
"Should you not wish to make the changes I have proposed, then in that case - and only in that case - Mr Heaton-Harris, you would be right, we would work to the agenda previously agreed."
"I will therefore now ask whether the Members are formally opposed to changing the order of business as I have just suggested."
"We will formally hear the case against the proposal and then I will take a speaker in favour of it."
"Mr President, it is undoubtedly true that you, as President, could leave the chair and the Assembly would be suspended."
"However, that is not the basis on which what happened before lunch time happened."
"That was on the premise of a proposal under Rule 171, from Mr Schulz, that the House be suspended."
"The rule is quite clear, that when such a proposal is made there should be a speaker for, and a speaker against."
"That was not the case, meaning that the proposal was irregular and should not have been put to the vote, and that the decision is not binding."
"You should, therefore, now return to the agenda."
"(FR) I would remind you again that the House is the sovereign authority here."
"So the President in the chair is entitled to do as I am now doing, namely to call on two colleagues to speak, one for and one against."
"That is a prerogative of the President."
"Of course the House has to take a vote, but I believe that a vote was taken this morning, and electronically confirmed."
"I do not think that the result of that vote can be contested."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I only wish to acknowledge that the President who chaired the sitting this morning did indeed forget to ask who wished to speak for and against the proposal."
"It is equally true, however, that a clear majority of this House voted that we should not debate or hear the explanations of vote now but at ten o'clock this evening."
"Now there is a new proposal, and I wish to support it on behalf of my Group and, I think, on behalf of other Members too."
"I believe the arrangement you have proposed makes good sense, and we shall see how the vote goes."
"Moreover, as you said yourself, the House is sovereign."
"The majority of the House will decide."
"(Applause)"
"(FR) Colleagues, I have taken one speaker against and one speaker for the motion."
"If someone has something to say at this point, it should be on a different matter, not to re-argue the for and against."
"If that is what you wish to do, I cannot give you the floor."
"Mr President, on a point of order, this Chamber may be sovereign, as you say, but it nonetheless must follow its own Rules of Procedure."
"The suspension or closure of a sitting is covered by Rule 171;"
"I quote, 'The sitting may be suspended or closed during a debate or a vote.'"
"Now, this morning was not during a debate or a vote, it was after the vote."
"Furthermore, Rule 163, 'Explanations of vote', does not allow discretion to the Chair to not hear them or to change the time."
"It reads explicitly, 'Once the general debate has been concluded, any Member may give an oral explanation on the final vote for not longer than one minute'."
"It is true that the rules of this House give substantial arbitrary power to the speaker."
"But these are two items where no such power pertains, and this House chose - in the most flagrant way - to tear up its own Rules of Procedure rather than delay a couple of people from having lunch."
"I have to say it is symbolic of the way in which the European Union is proceeding with the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, nay, European Constitution, that you tear up your own rule book when it does not suit you, rather than tolerate an opposing point of view."
"(FR) What I propose, colleagues, is as follows: clearly we are not in a position this afternoon, here in plenary session, to assess all the various arguments about the interpretation of this rule."
"If Members wish to engage in recriminations, let them do so in writing to the President of Parliament."
"I am sure that he will refer complaints to the appropriate committee."
"What I am concerned to do now is simply to decide on the order of business."
"I have made a proposal."
"I have heard one Member speak against it and one Member for it."
"I now put it to the vote."
"(Parliament agreed to the request.)"
"(The order of business was thus established.)"
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting"
"(FR) The Minutes of the sitting of Monday 14 January 2008 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very kind of you to give me the floor 20 minutes after I asked for it, even though I am right opposite the presidency."
"I want to speak for the record and for the sake of democracy in this Chamber."
"The Presidency of Parliament and all the group chairmen must realise that two wrongs do not make a right."
"What is politically useful is not always politically correct and after listening today to the Grand Mufti we have to decide in a manner that is clear and unequivocal for all of us whether we in this Chamber follow the democratic provisions of the Rules of Procedure or follow the interest each individual may have according to circumstances."
"A mistake was made this morning with regard to Parliament's Rules of Procedure and we will not correct that error by voting today in an empty Chamber."
"We are making another mistake to the detriment of democracy here."
"I am not saying on behalf of the UEN Group whether it is important to discuss the waste in Italy at 9 p.m. this evening or at 5 p.m. tomorrow, or whether it is important for explanations of vote to follow the vote, as has always been the custom in this Parliament, when the vote is expressed as it should have been this morning."
"I do ask you, however, Mr President - and you may cut me off, that does not interest me at all - what this Parliament's Rules of Procedure say?"
"Do you know?"
"In regard to this question, you want to reply to this deserted Chamber that it should vote on the basis of those who were given the floor and not those who wanted to express an independent view!"
"That is madness!"
"(FR) Madame President, I trust my tone will be as measured as your own was agitated."
"I gave you the floor because I wished to know whether you were for or against approval of the Minutes of Monday 14 January."
"You had nothing to say on that point."
"I was, however, courteous enough to hear you out and I hope that our colleagues will be similarly appreciative of the manner in which you chose to address the House."
"I shall take it, therefore, that there are no comments, as Madame President is not seeking the floor again."
"(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved.)"
"Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child (debate)"
"The next item is Roberta Angelilli's report, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs - Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank colleagues for their valuable cooperation, and in particular Mr Frattini for his commitment since the beginning of his mandate to safeguard the rights of the child."
"The report obviously does not pretend to be exhaustive, but I believe it is a good point of departure."
"The objective was to lay the bases for a strategy aimed at promoting and safeguarding the rights of minors in the European Union's internal and external policies and to support Member States' efforts in that sector."
"We wanted to take as our premise the specific nature of the rights of minors, which are totally distinct from the more general category of fundamental rights, although they form an integral part of them."
"The strategy aims above all at the positive affirmation of the rights of the child, which include the right to a family, the right to health, education, social inclusion, but also the right to entertainment, the right to play, to engage in sport, together with the right to a clean and protected environment."
"In substance, the aim is to create a society tailored to the child, in which the child can feel protected and actively involved."
"That is why the report is based on two main presumptions: (1) active participation of children in decision-making that affects them; (2) mainstreaming, that is to say incorporating and promoting the rights of the child in all European Union policies."
"In short, the rights of minors must finally become a political priority for Europe, given also that children account for about 30% of European citizens and much still remains to be done for them, beginning with the fight against violence and abuse, in face of the worrying growth of paedophilia and child pornography networks."
"The general objective is to ban all forms of violence, including so-called traditional practices, honour crimes, and forced marriages."
"It is not enough only to ensure the certain punishment of those who commit violence; we must guarantee a strategy of prevention, aimed especially at helping children at risk."
"Another priority is to combat child poverty."
"It is worth pointing out that even within the European Union 19% of children live below the poverty line and we must, therefore, provide aid measures that are also designed to support their families."
"In particular, we need measures targeted at Roma children and street children, who are often forced to beg and thus become easy victims of exploitation, trafficking and organised crime."
"Another basic aspect of the strategy is to guarantee the education and training of all children, including the most poor and disadvantaged."
"We also need measures targeted at the less able, so as to prevent any form of discrimination."
"We are among experts here so perhaps there is no need in this Chamber to list all the urgent problems that need to be tackled: from the marketing of violent video games to the rise in cases of international kidnapping of minors, the red tape that makes international adoptions difficult, the tragedy of the child soldiers, child labour, the failure to register the birth of a child, the remarkable number of disappeared children of which no more is ever heard."
"I could go on and on."
"In truth, we must apply the appropriate instruments and provide prompt information in order to exchange experiences and good practice, and we must create synergy between the related legal and penal instruments in order to address the problems in concrete terms and in real time and possibly succeed in preventing them."
"Let me conclude by saying that approval of the Lisbon Treaty will give us a few more chances."
"The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights now forms part of the Treaty, including, therefore, Article 24, which expressly governs the rights of the child, thus creating a legal basis for implementing the strategy."
"At this point, we as a Parliament, but above all the Member States, must set to work immediately."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me give warm thanks to Mrs Angelilli for this report."
"From the start of my term of office, the rights of the child have clearly been a top priority, a central item of my agenda, and the cooperation with Parliament in this field too has now led to the policy lines that will be the outcome of this report - which I hope will be adopted by a very large majority - guidelines for action that the Commission will follow, for there is not a single point in that report that I do not endorse."
"It sets out horizontal initiatives that cover a number of policies, but the common denominator is that minors, that is children, form the heart of our society and it is, therefore, clear that they deserve our utmost attention."
"Over the coming weeks I, together with my staff, will consider how to put the individual points contained in Mrs Angellili's report into practice on the basis of concrete initiatives."
"There are, in fact, already some measures under way. They include the presentation of a communication that you have taken into account and that dates back to July 2006, a general communication on a European strategy on the rights of the child that has the entirely political objective of making those rights a political priority, as Mrs Angelilli noted."
"Other measures now under way include the creation of a standard helpline telephone number, 116 000, which will be the same throughout Europe."
"Let me take this opportunity to invite the many Member States that have not yet put that measure into practice to lose no more time in doing so; here, I am obviously addressing not Parliament but Member State governments."
"That decision was taken more than a year ago yet more than half the Member States still do not have a helpline that actually works, although it is a decision that, I believe, could have been implemented in a short space of time."
"Last October we discussed, with the Presidency in Lisbon, whether we could jointly set up a European network of early warning systems for the event of the abduction or disappearance of children."
"You know we were looking at the good example of the French system, we looked at how things worked in Belgium, we noted that Portugal and Greece were setting up, or in recent weeks have already set up systems; but it is clear that child abductors disregard borders and, therefore, early warning systems cannot stop at geographical borders."
"We have done a lot of work on Internet crime against children."
"Our work with a conference of experts last November produced important results in terms of the kind of technical cooperation that could lead to the interconnection of electronic systems to prevent and react to on-line paedophilia."
"That is one of the most terrible threats to children, and you know that thanks to its inclusion among the 2007 priorities of Eurojust and Europol we are now able to dismantle many international paedophile networks operating via the Internet."
"We also submitted a report last November - one of the points that was emphasised - on progress in implementing the framework decision dating back to 2004 on combating the sexual exploitation of children."
"In that report, as you may remember, I highlighted the fact that too many Member States have still not transposed that 2004 framework decision, dating back four years now, on the sexual exploitation of children."
"We certainly created a useful instrument with the European Forum."
"The first experience with it in Germany, under the German Presidency, mainly related to Internet abuse and violent video games."
"The next European Forum on the rights of the child, which will take place under the Slovenian Presidency, will address other subjects, including in particular international adoptions."
"We will look at the situation and, as Mrs Angelilli hoped, we are also looking into practical ways of inviting children, children's representatives, to take direct part in all European Forum meetings."
"You will understand that it is a delicate matter to invite children, including rather small children, to take part in those meetings, but that is the objective that has been decided and we will, therefore, fall in with that proposal from Parliament too."
"We are developing a dedicated European website for children, written and presented in a simple way, which explains, for example, how to guard against the many safety threats to children in everyday life in a non-aggressive and non-shocking way; it explains how to, let us say, steer clear of such dangers."
"We have said very little about the Fundamental Rights Agency; one of my proposals was to make the rights of the child a priority under that Agency's multiannual programme."
"We still have much to do."
"Mrs Angelilli rightly says that we must consider migrant children."
"That is an aspect we will address specifically in the framework of European immigration policy: children are often victims, they are often the most vulnerable in the general context of migration flows."
"We must place more emphasis on the need to implement the European action plan to combat people-trafficking, with particular reference to children, in addition to women, for as the two weakest categories they are often the victims of international people-trafficking."
"We must look into means of financing practical proposals and projects under European programmes."
"The new Daphne programme and the new fundamental rights programme may, for example, enable us also to provide financial aid for the European Network of Ombudspeople for Children."
"I attach great importance to that network and also, clearly, to the NGOs working in that field."
"The new programme, known as Daphne III, has been refinanced and may serve as a particularly useful instrument."
"In conclusion, I am, of course, more than ready and willing to continue developing this political strategy, with a view also to producing very concrete results for our citizens in one of the areas particularly close to our heart."
"Rapporteur of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (EL) Mr President, protection of the rights of the child has never been lacking from the internal and external policies of the European Union, but because of the absence of a legal basis, these policies have been piecemeal, and for this reason your proposal, Mr Vice-President, for the development of a strategy for the protection of the rights of the child has been favourably received by the European Parliament, and also by civil society."
"We hope it will be strengthened with the entry into force of the Reform Treaty, which will include as an integral part the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as was mentioned by the rapporteur, Mrs Angelilli, whom I congratulate for her skills of synthesis and her presentation of today's report."
"With the possibility of an integrated and coordinated approach to the protection of children at European level - thanks, amongst other things, to the numerous interesting proposals by the Commission - the child must be regarded not as a victim, but as the holder of positive rights and obligations, who should grow up in a healthy family environment with the assurance that his or her material and non-material needs will be met."
"Respect for the rights of the child should be strengthened not only through the planning of European actions, but also by the political will of the Member States, with measures which will answer to the fundamental needs of children and protect them against multiple dangers."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality focused, in its opinion, on the question of supporting the mother and the family in the performance of their obligations."
"It urged support for vulnerable groups, namely children at risk due to abuse and lack of education, healthcare, proper nutrition and opportunities to develop and achieve their potential."
"The reconciliation of the parents' working lives with family life: this is an inalienable right of the child, and also represents the creation of valuable capital and an investment in the society of the future."
"Both inside and outside the European Union, children's positive rights are often violated, and there is still discriminatory treatment due to sexual inequality."
"There are gender stereotypes and perceptions which marginalize some groups of children and particularly girls and young mothers."
"The protection of women, especially during pregnancy and when they are bringing up children, must be a requirement, so that children, from the very start of their lives, can enjoy their fundamental rights."
"Thank you very much, Mr Chairman, and I also thank Mrs Angelilli for her report."
"I welcome the fact that the Slovenian Presidency chose as one of its priorities the question of children in armed conflicts, which was also one of my topics."
"My opinion on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs also deals with the need to register children at birth."
"Children who are not registered are invisible and therefore often become victims of sexual abuse or trafficking; they are imprisoned along with adults and are used as active combatants in the armed forces, because it is impossible to establish whether or not they are already adults."
"The birth certificate of a child guarantees the child his name and nationality as well as access to medical care, for example."
"I regret, however, that the report is only being adopted in January: the majority of the opinions were voted on and submitted to the committee before the summer and the report could thus have been adopted earlier."
"A solution to this issue of children rights is needed urgently."
"One illustration of this is the recent case of the transfer of more than 100 Chad children to France."
"The aim of the action was to help the deserted families in Darfur; the children - orphans - would be looked after by foster parents in Europe."
"The UN confirmed, however, that in the majority of cases the children were not orphans and did not come from Darfur, but from Chad, the neighbouring country."
"Finding an urgent solution to the issue of children's rights is not only a necessity for developing countries: it is a necessity for us too."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - Mr President, I would like to say at the outset that the Committee on Development feels very strongly that it is important for the Commission to mainstream children's rights into all aspects of development policy, seeing this as a means of achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"I know that the Commission communication proposes to deal with such issues."
"I wish to state very clearly that we need a children's rights approach and need to move away from a common focusing, in this debate so far, on issues such as child-trafficking, abduction and pornography."
"We need to ensure that we understand we are talking about the rights of children: the rights of children to be consulted; the rights of children to be listened to; and the rights of children to have the respect of adults and not be told by adults what they should be doing."
"I also very much welcome the fact that the Lisbon Treaty makes reference to children's rights."
"We welcome this, because at the moment only animal rights have this kind of legal base in the European Union, and we urgently needed to make this the case for children too."
"Finally, in the wider world and in Europe itself, we need to see that what we are doing is safeguarding children's lives and generally enhancing the well-being of all the children in Europe and in the wider world."
"Rapporteur of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (EL) Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Angelilli on the constructive work she has done."
"The strategy for the rights of the child is a positive step towards a coordinated approach both to internal policy and to external relations."
"The Committee on Employment, whose opinion I drafted and am now presenting, emphasises the social aspects of violation of the rights of the child."
"It focuses on child poverty, which affects nearly one child in five in the European Union."
"It also stresses the problems of child labour and social exclusion, and calls for special attention to be given to the vulnerable social groups, such as child immigrants, street children and children with disabilities."
"We are afraid that today's children, Mr President, are being called upon to live in a world worse that that known by previous generations."
"The European Union must therefore act now, with substantial commitments, targets and necessary resources, both at Community level and at the level of Member States."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (DE) Mr President, may I begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her report and on the cooperative nature of our deliberations."
"We fully agree with many major aspects of the report."
"I wish to highlight two points, however, to which I attach particular importance. The first of these is the right to education as a prerequisite for children's social development."
"The Member States must create unhampered access to education for all children and young people, regardless of their ethnic and social background and their family circumstances."
"This also means that any kind of exclusion, discrimination and violence against children must be prevented."
"It is essential to press ahead as quickly as possible with the launch of the helpline."
"The second point that is very important to me is the promotion of language, as languages are one of Europe's cultural treasures."
"There is also an innovation that we should not overlook, for the rights of children also extend now to their involvement in new developments in the field of education and training and in particular the cultivation of media literacy. Competence in the use of information and communication media is an extremely important educational tool and must be vigorously developed."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you for the floor, Mr President."
"I think there are only a few of us who would not be directly or indirectly affected by the topic of protecting the rights of children."
"The Community institutions have already dealt frequently with various aspects of this topic, but agreed with the submitting committee that, in addition to all this, a comprehensive strategy needs to be developed."
"There are some specific areas that we absolutely must take into account when working out such a vision."
"These include, for example, the prohibition of all kinds of violence against children, fighting poverty and discrimination, and the right to education."
"As Mr Frattini stated in his introduction that the Agency will deal with this area in particular, I would like to make a recommendation to you: why not make the first specific request from the Commission to the Agency that it investigate the enforcement of precisely this area, the rights of the child?"
"I find the sexual abuse of children, child labour and the enormous differences existing today between how children with refugee status are treated in individual Member States particularly worrying."
"The problem of street children and children forced to beg is a serious problem here in our immediate surroundings."
"I am also convinced that the fight for the complete enforcement of the rights of the child within the Union must mean above all reassessing the role of the family in this new Europe, and reinforcing the role of upbringing alongside education, so that our children receive guidance, as well as professional knowledge, in our ever more troubled world."
"Perhaps fewer children would be inclined towards violence, suffering physically or damaged psychologically. Thank you."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (SV) Mr President, I want to start by thanking Mrs Angelilli and all the shadow rapporteurs, but also all the Members who have contributed to getting us to a point where we shall soon have the first decision of the European Parliament on an EU strategy on the rights of the child."
"The key question concerns the involvement and influence of children."
"There will be some painstaking and important work to be done in order to ensure that this becomes a reality and not just words."
"Children and young people expect as much."
"The point that I consider to have been the greatest success is the proposal concerning violence against children."
"The committee has unanimously backed my demand that all violence against children, including corporal punishment in the home, must be prohibited by Community legislation."
"It is a great success for children."
"In my home country, Sweden, where corporal punishment is banned, every child at nursery school and all young people know that adults may not strike a child."
"The fact that we are now making it clear that there must be cooperation in putting an end to all forms of abuse of children means that we need increased cooperation from relevant bodies such as banks, travel firms, credit firms and exchange bureaux to stop child pornography, sex tourism and the exploitation of children, and to get an internet which is safe from paedophiles."
"Illegal websites must also be shut down."
"Member States must legislate against buying sex in order to ensure that children do not become a trade commodity."
"The most difficult problem we had in the committee related to adoption."
"I am very happy that we are now agreed that a child has a right to a family , irrespective of whether it is the child's own family, a foster family or through national or international adoption."
"It is the child's best interests which should decide the matter, not adults' best interests."
"We all remember what happened at children's homes in Romania and Guatemala recently - kidnappings of children for adoption are fresh in our memories."
"Children are not a trade commodity."
"It is now up to the Commission to listen to the wisdom which we have shown in Parliament and to come back with concrete proposals on how we are to give effect to children's rights which now, with the new Lisbon Treaty, become an objective to be embodied in law in the EU."
"With the new Lisbon Treaty the EU must listen and ensure that the rights of children are integrated into its work."
"This must happen as a matter of course and must also apply in the global perspective, in development work, in culture and in all areas."
"Child poverty will of course be a central issue, but also the question of how children fare in war and in relation to health risks of all kinds."
"I am proud to have participated in this work in Parliament, which will take a decision on the matter tomorrow."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ET) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament has finally reached this debate on the European Union's strategy for children's rights because a policy which encourages children's rights will form the bedrock of tomorrow's society."
"The well-being of society and the state depends on the values and methods used by future parents."
"My thanks to the rapporteur for drafting such a comprehensive document."
"It is appropriate that the principles set out in the UN Convention on the rights of the child and its additional protocols have been used as the basis for developing an EU strategy on the rights of the child."
"However, this strategy to be more effective and applicable throughout all 27 Member States, it must contain more specific provision for implementing measures whose application would be supported both by using Member States' and European Union resources."
"The strategy is comprehensive, and I do not have time to go into every aspect."
"I would like to highlight just one positive initiative, but one which is effective in all respects, namely the recommendation in the European Union children's rights strategy for a European Union-wide child helpline telephone number; we have had a child helpline number in Estonia for three years now and I can confirm to you that it works well."
"I would like to direct your attention to two important target groups, the safeguarding of whose rights I believe we should focus our thoughts on more keenly."
"The first of those target groups is disabled children."
"It strikes me that in our strategy on the rights of the child, greater attention should be focused on safeguarding disabled children's rights; and that also they, like other target groups, should have genuinely guaranteed opportunities, equal opportunities, to be actively involved in the life of society."
"The second area I would like to highlight is that of guaranteeing the rights of children who are not cared for by their parents."
"All children unquestionably have the right to a family."
"Unfortunately today it is not possible for all children to grow up in the bosom of the family, and they live in children's homes."
"We have not paid sufficient attention in our documentation to children who have left children's homes at about 18 or 19 years of age: legally they are adults, although in social terms they are not; this is an area which we should begin to focus some attention."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, as an MEP who for some years now has been involved in protecting the rights of children, I am very pleased to accept the report of Mrs Angelilli concerning the creation of a unified EU strategy on the rights of the child."
"Violations of children's rights, violence against children, the trade in children for illegal adoptions, prostitution, illegal work or for begging on the streets: these continue to be an enormous problem for the EU."
"Every strategy concerning children's rights should be based on the values and principles contained in the UN Convention, particularly as regards protection against all forms of discrimination."
"Every child must have a guaranteed right to have continuous and direct contact with both parents, as well as the right to be brought up in the parents' culture and the right to learn the language of both parents."
"These rights are repeatedly violated by the German Office for Children and Young People, the Jugendamt, as regards children one of whose parents is foreign."
"In cases of divorce, the Jugendamt uses any method to deprive the parent who is not German of their parental rights."
"Children are deprived of their right to learn the language of the second parent, and it is forbidden to have conversations in languages other than German during meetings that have been arranged."
"Official documents state that it is harmful for children to be bilingual."
"Over 250 complaints against the actions of this office have been filed with the Committee on Petitions."
"Despite the fact that a year ago the European Commission stated that the actions of the German Jugendamt violate Article 12 of the EU Treaty, which bans all discrimination, the German state has become even stricter in its discriminatory practices against children of foreigners and this is an absolute scandal."
"I hope that since this report is the voice of the European Parliament, this will help to remove the discrimination that is found in this area."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, children are not mini-adults, nor are they what people call a natural part of the family or of society."
"They are legal persons with their own rights."
"All Member States of the EU signed the ground-breaking UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, but in many aspects of children's rights we in Europe have barely scratched the surface."
"One bright spot is the fact that the European Commission has put children's rights on the agenda, but the Commission's proposal, in our view, still comprises too many fine words and too few specific measures."
"I am pleased that the report fleshes out the Commission's recommendation, and for this I reiterate my congratulations to the rapporteur."
"We must hope that the Commission is doing its homework and will be more specific in the 2008 Green Paper on the rights of the child."
"We need indicators and precise timetables for the realisation of children's rights."
"Allow me to focus on three points that are important to me. The first of these concerns the rights of girls, especially girls from migrant backgrounds."
"Realising the rights of the child invariably involves the establishment of equality between girls and boys and equal opportunities for both, and this is reflected in the present report too."
"Let me express my gratification at the adoption by the committee and the rapporteur of our proposal that headscarves for girls should be banned at least in primary schools in the EU in order to give girls genuine freedom of choice and the right to a childhood."
"Likewise, there is no justification for prohibiting girls from migrant backgrounds from attending school."
"The second point to which I attach great importance is that of violence against children and increasing neglect."
"There is a need to improve children's media literacy."
"There has been an alarming rise in the dissemination of pornographic material and scenes of violence through mobile phones, and this leads to desensitisation and an accelerating spiral of violence."
"I ask you, Mr Frattini, to look long and hard at ways of improving the protection of young people in the media and of protecting children more effectively against violence."
"My third point concerns the environmental rights of the child, a subject that no one has raised yet. By this I mean the right of every child to grow up in an intact environment."
"Regrettably, in its strategy on the rights of the child, the Commission did not consider the need to take more account of children, not just adults, when we set future pollutant ceilings."
"That applies to noise levels as well as to hazardous substances."
"I therefore ask you to incorporate the environmental rights of the child, for today's children are the citizens of tomorrow."
"We all bear responsibility for ensuring that our European home is also a child-friendly home."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank Mrs Angelilli for her sensitive approach to a very important matter: a society that knows how to welcome its children will know how to welcome all its citizens."
"In the same way, I believe that today in this Parliament we are taking a very important step, because institutions that are able to address the concerns of minors will certainly be more able to address the concerns of all European citizens."
"This report contains many interesting and dynamic ideas, which are also pointers for the Commission in relation to further steps that we expect."
"There are some points that need to be emphasised, especially the need to pay great attention to unaccompanied minors held in administrative detention centres for migrants."
"When it inspected those centres, the European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties found that in many countries, such as France, Belgium and Italy, many unaccompanied minors, many children, are held in inhuman and degrading conditions that are unacceptable for young children as, incidentally, they are unacceptable for all men and women."
"We emphasise the need to insist on that point."
"We also believe that great attention must be paid to avoiding child labour."
"Child labour is often linked to exploitation and poverty."
"That is why that this Parliament must make a major contribution towards improving social conditions in the European Union."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I have many things to say about the rights of the child."
"Firstly, I welcome the amendments to this report that focus on the family and their importance in providing for a child's development."
"I would like to stress the primacy of parents - not the state - as the guardian of children and, for this reason, the importance of support for the family in their responsibilities."
"The state should assist the parents in protecting and promoting the child, and it should only take over from the parents when the parents are unwilling or unable to serve their children."
"On the issue of disability, I praise this report for acknowledging that children with disabilities should be assured full respect and granted equal treatment."
"I myself have represented many children and their parents who struggled to guarantee education for them."
"A tragic flaw in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on which this is based is that, although it guarantees primary education for all children, it makes specific educational provision needed by disabled children 'subject to resources'."
"These three words have militated against children with special needs getting the help they need in my country."
"Amendment 3 deals with children within the EU who have previously been in institutionalised care."
"This important issue has come to the attention of many MEPs following the BBC documentary Bulgaria's abandoned children, which focused on care homes for children with disabilities."
"There will be a screening of this documentary with the participation of the film-maker on 4 March 2008, to which I invite all my colleagues."
"Recently the EU voted against an amendment placed before the Committee on Budgets that sought to divert EU funding that goes into institutions towards community- and family-based services."
"This amendment failed."
"We must be coherent in our approach to de-institutionalisation and integrate children into society, and we must put our funding into community-based approaches in the future."
"I also welcome the strong line Parliament takes on trafficking, especially with Amendment 1."
"It is hard to imagine anything worse happening to a child than being stolen from their family, whether for military, sexual or labour purposes, or even to fulfil the desire of a couple for a child."
"I also want to mention the trafficking of babies before and after birth for organ and cell harvesting and remind my colleagues that the preamble of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child includes children before birth as well as after."
"I am pleased that the report takes into account migrant families and unaccompanied minors."
"With increasing cultural blends, we must continue to acknowledge the importance of embracing all children in our ever-changing society."
"As much as it is wonderful that labour migration enables parents to go abroad and earn more and provide better for their families, we need to be working towards an equity that will not necessitate this separation and will allow families to stay together in their home country or their country of choosing."
"Now I should like to address the issue of sexual and reproductive rights, which is repeated in six articles of this report."
"I am personally responsible for six teenage girls and two teenage boys."
"Of course they need to know the facts of life but, at the same time, they need to know the most important fact of life: that they are extremely valuable, developing individuals, persons with a dignity and a future, with a unique contribution to make to their community and family."
"They do not benefit from the message that is so often given in the name of sexual and reproductive rights that they cannot be responsible and are, in fact, walking disasters who need adult help with damage control, and that they can get this help without any negative effects to themselves or without the knowledge of their parents."
"The richness of adolescence can and should receive the support of those who are older, who love them and who have already been there."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my colleague's report is excellent and I regard Union action and a Union strategy to protect the rights of the child as priorities."
"We must recognise that minors have rights and call for policies and measures in that area that are also aimed at protecting the life of the individual from the moment of conception."
"The report calls for further measures and - and no one can disagree with this - for the affirmation of children's rights as an integral part of the rights that are binding on the Union and its Member States and that require a specific legal basis."
"Among the many urgent problems facing children let me highlight the striking number of disappearances; these child disappearances often have a tragic ending as a result of sexual exploitation and violence linked to child pornography."
"I believe the Union cannot accept that any of its Member States should in any way tolerate paedophilia of any kind and must ban the right to advertise it and, obviously, to commit it."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"In light of the demographic crisis, every child's life has a price put on it."
"We cannot press unilaterally for an increase in the birth rate whilst paying scant attention to ensuring the conditions necessary for the living conditions, equal opportunities and spiritual and physical development of the children that have been born."
"I therefore consider Mr Frattini's commitment to giving horizontal priority in Union policy to guaranteeing the rights of the child as extremely important."
"The report, on which I would like to congratulate Mrs Angelilli, rightly highlights certain problems that must be solved with the utmost urgency."
"The extent of child poverty is staggering, since, as my fellow Members have mentioned, every fifth child lives in poverty, and of course this is very closely linked to leaving school early."
"We cannot close our eyes to the situations of the several thousand street children and homeless children in the Member States of the Union, of whom many are forced into begging, stealing, illegal labour or prostitution."
"According to a study published recently by UNICEF, there are no countries, and no Member States, that are not affected by the matter of child trafficking."
"We know little about the children, estimated to be several hundred, who disappear from children's institutions and refugee camps each year."
"Violence against children and the increase in aggression among children are grounds for justifiable concern."
"Mr President, under the Lisbon Treaty, the rights of the child are guaranteed by Article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The report - the adoption of which I support - is the first step for the Union's institutions, including the Parliament, to take serious steps in order to comply with the rights of the child, and improve their situations, more consistently."
"Then, hopefully, the Member States will not spare their efforts either. Thank you for your attention."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I am delighted that the Commission is proposing to put in place an EU strategy on the rights of the child."
"Because a great many EU policies affect children, we need to take specific measures so that their rights can be protected and their active participation encouraged."
"I am particularly pleased that Parliament has called for a definition to identify 'children at risk'."
"This will enable us to provide specific help to children who are victims of a social situation that threatens their mental or physical health."
"At the same time, we cannot simply leave children who live in poverty to their fate."
"These children do not always receive the protection they need, because their parents lack the necessary resources."
"If they are not to be condemned to social exclusion, they therefore need special assistance, and governments must be responsible for ensuring that all children - whatever their parents' social or legal circumstances - have access to health and education, so that equality of opportunity for all is actually guaranteed in practice."
"I should like to highlight the particular situation of migrant children."
"Administrative detention of children is not acceptable."
"We cannot understand why anyone fleeing from war or from desperate circumstances should be treated like a criminal, and that applies all the more so in the case of children, all of whom are entitled to protection and education in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"- (LT) We acknowledge that children's rights are part of human rights, which we are obliged to respect under international and European agreements."
"Children's rights are acknowledged in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"This should become a component of the Reform Treaty and be obligatory for all EU Member States."
"Commissioner Frattini, in the communication you say that the situation within the Union with regard to the protection of children's rights is still not satisfactory."
"But I think it is awful."
"Almost one fifth of children live in poverty."
"In Lithuania, almost half the families consisting of one adult and dependent children live in poverty."
"Moreover, we are not able to obtain statistics on how many children in the enlarged Community were left without parents when they emigrated in search of employment and left their children without appropriate care."
"We read about sexual and psychological violence against children with horror."
"We have compassion for children who we meet in the street and put a coin in their begging hands."
"However, more often we do nothing because it is easier to turn away, close our eyes, and say it is not our fault, others are responsible for it."
"You, Commissioner Frattini, say that it is the responsibility of individual Member States and you do not want to intrude in their affairs."
"Brussels intrudes in many of the affairs of Member States: it is important for us to regulate agriculture, internal markets, the flow of capital."
"We think that these are the issues of vital importance."
"I believe that our biggest concern should be human rights and, primarily, children."
"They are our future."
"I think that specifically the European Union should take responsibility for guaranteeing human rights and, primarily, children's rights."
"I disapprove of a document that merely takes care, remembers and encourages."
"I think that here we are required to actively take care of our citizens."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Ms Angelilli for an excellent report on a subject that is key for the future of the European Union."
"Most of the proposals in this report are of course deserving of support, but I have a couple of concerns."
"First of all, the principle of equality of girls and boys is discussed, which could be understood as saying that they are identical, whereas every parent knows that girls and boys are different and require a different approach as regards their upbringing in order to fulfil the principle of their equal dignity."
"Secondly, from the point of view of children's rights, the increase in the number of alternative family structures, which is discussed in the report, constitutes a threat against which action should be taken."
"There is no mention of the threat in this report."
"And thirdly, as there is a call in paragraph 167 to provide children and young people with sexual education, paragraphs 163 and 164, which speak of the right to sexual and reproductive health, are unnecessary unless these terms are being used to hide a right to abortion."
"At this point it can be seen that it is not possible to separate the rights of children who have already been born from the rights of unborn children Even though they begin life as embryos they inevitably become children, and if anyone has any doubts about this they should remember that we were all once embryos."
"(PT) In this one-minute speech I would like to stress that I consider the European Union's first priority in relation to children to be to assess the effect of its policies on failure to enforce or the enforcement of children's rights, in particular in connection with a rapid and substantial reduction in child poverty, providing all children with equal opportunities."
"In this context I would like to ask, by way of example: what effect does the European Union's monetary policy and its objective of price stability, or rather, wage restraint, have on failure to enforce children's rights?"
"What effect do European Union 'flexicurity', labour market deregulation, easier dismissals, increasingly insecure employment contracts, increased working time and the flexibilisation of working hours have on failure to enforce children's rights?"
"What effect do current European Union policies promoting the deregulation and privatisation of public services, including health and education, have on failure to enforce children's rights?"
"These are some examples of what would be the European Union's most appropriate, necessary and urgent mainstreaming in relation to children's rights."
"(PT) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, violence against those who cannot defend themselves is particularly reprehensible."
"Violence against children is especially odious."
"Community legislation that prohibits all forms of violence, whether physical, psychological or sexual, is required."
"Mention has already been made of UNICEF data for 2003, which indicate that in some Community countries, such as France, around three children die every week from abuse and negligence, while in others, such as Germany and the United Kingdom, the figure stands at around two per week."
"I welcome the commitment of European Union Member States and institutions in implementing child policies, which have grown in number in recent years."
"Existing legislation, policies and structures, however, are still insufficient to respond to the whole range of questions raised in connection with protecting children, whether they are victims of poverty, trafficking, domestic violence, sexual abuse, pornography, child labour or the outrage of child soldiers that persists in the 21st century."
"I therefore congratulate Mr Frattini on this initiative, which shows that the required willingness exists to make this an EU priority and to create a general EU strategy to effectively promote and protect children's rights in internal and external policies."
"I am also very pleased that the new Treaty of Lisbon incorporates children's rights as one of the objectives of the EU, thus providing a new legal basis for defending those rights."
"Prevention and awareness-raising must be improved and social rights to support victims must be strengthened."
"Cross-border operations against child pornography Internet sites must also be reinforced to ensure that the sites are closed down and the criminal networks dismantled."
"The Internet offers children excellent opportunities to communicate and to obtain information, but we must ensure that they do so safely."
"(EL) Mr President, our children have independent personalities, they have an inviolable right to the protection of their fundamental rights, which means no degrading treatment and violence, no inhuman working conditions, no exclusion from education, no poverty, no sexual exploitation and abuse, no child soldiers at war."
"And children have greater need of these universal values than adults do."
"Firstly because they are, by definition, young and vulnerable."
"Secondly, because the parent or teacher or priest and all those with whom they come into contact are always in a position of authority towards them; and thirdly, because if anything goes wrong during childhood, this ultimately has a decisive effect on a child's future life."
"These are the rights which we are called upon to support today."
"I shall focus on two:"
"Firstly, the children of immigrants are perhaps the most vulnerable."
"Those who are born amongst us, at least, must immediately acquire the nationality of our country."
"They should not be stigmatised from birth, and should of course go to school regardless of their parents' status, and should not be condemned to social exclusion."
"Secondly, protection of children on the internet: children who often go online and surf unsuspectingly and talk to strangers, and children who may be victims of sexual exploitation - commodities in a very profitable business."
"Mr President, the internet is the new village square."
"Just as parents warn their children not to talk to strangers in the village square, so they should be educated and made aware that similar concern and advice are needed when it comes to the internet."
"Europe should play its part in providing such education as well as helplines for parents and children faced with such situations."
"Mr President, I agree with virtually all the recommendations made in this excellent report."
"In particular, I agree that the future EU strategy should recognise the important role of the family as the basic institution in society for the survival, protection and development of the child."
"I also support the right of the child to maintain, on a regular basis, a personal relationship and direct contact with his or her parents unless, of course, that is contrary to the child's best interests."
"I fully endorse the suggestions in this report to establish a child-friendly society, in which children can feel protected and actively involved."
"Paragraph 27 urges the Commission and Member States to take action to ensure observance of the rights of mentally-disabled children to access education."
"In an Irish context they have a right to an appropriate primary education, but this is subject to resources."
"In reality this often means they receive an inappropriate primary education."
"Paragraph 27 also states that mentally-disabled children should have access to the courts."
"There was recently a case in Ireland of a young girl with Downs Syndrome who had been sexually assaulted, and yet a judge decided she was not competent to tell the truth to the jury."
"He tested her in court with the assistance of the prosecution lawyers."
"During this test, the accused and his lawyers were present, but the girl's family was ordered to leave the court."
"Unless all children can be assured of the absolute right to access the courts we will be failing our children."
"Finally, I should like to put a short question to the Commissioner."
"The recent decision to incorporate children's rights into the Lisbon Treaty as one of the objectives of the EU will provide a new legal basis for children's rights."
"Can the Commissioner elaborate - even briefly - on the practical outcomes he expects from this?"
"I put this question particularly in the light of the forthcoming referendum in Ireland on the Lisbon Treaty."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to draw attention to the problem raised in paragraph 118 of the report with regard to restrictions on free contact with children in broken multi-national families."
"There are particularly glaring examples of this in Germany as a result of the actions taken by the institution called the Jugendamt."
"As a result of these actions, parents who are not German citizens are deprived of the right to speak to their children in their own language, and, in extreme circumstances, are even deprived of their parental rights."
"The provisions creating the Jugendamt date back to 1939, I repeat, 1939, and they continue to function under the law in an almost unchanged form."
"This institution acts on behalf of what is called the good of the child, but this concept has not been defined anywhere, which means that it can be interpreted in any way whatsoever."
"In proceedings, the Jugendamt favours parents of German background."
"Another concern is that it is not subject to any outside controls; for this reason I would ask that the European Commission should prepare a regulatory proposal that would make it possible to avoid any form of discrimination in the institutions of Member States, as is currently the case in Germany."
"(PL) Mr President, first of all I would like to express my total agreement with the statement by Mrs Foltyn-Kubicka."
"The issue of protection of children's rights has benefited from the increasing attention paid to it by European Union legislators."
"At the same time, however, an ever-increasing number of areas coming under EU jurisdiction have a direct impact on the rights of the child."
"For this reason it is with pleasure that I accept the Commission's announcement concerning the introduction of a strategy on the rights of the child."
"The intention to give priority to this issue in the European Union, i.e. acknowledging children as fully fledged subjects of law, is deserving of our full support."
"However, the cautious title of the report, i.e. 'towards a strategy', not simply 'a strategy', would suggest that there will be further steps in the form of public consultations, which could help to set out the chief priorities for future EU measures."
"To date, the European Union has not yet created any special legal foundation concerning the rights of the child."
"At this point I would like to state my disappointment, since, if the constitutional treaty had been ratified, it would have introduced a more appropriate legal framework in Article I-3, which had a direct application to the rights of the child."
"Protection of the rights of the child as an internal and external objective of the European Union was included in the Lisbon Treaty."
"These rights are also enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It is shameful, however, that one hundred million children living in the European Union are not equal as regards the rights and freedoms that they possess."
"It is obvious that, because of their vulnerability and specific needs, children require special care, as well as appropriate legal protection."
"However, the rights of the child should not be separated from, and should not be in opposition to, human rights in general."
"An analysis of EU documents would suggest that there could be a movement in favour of treating the rights of the child as an issue that is somehow separate from human rights as a whole."
"This is a dangerous path and could create dangerous divisions."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur that she did not allow the delicate nature of this issue to cloud her balanced approach to the subject."
"It is good that the report does not concentrate exclusively on protective measures, but also emphasises the need for positive affirmation of the rights of the child, such as the right to a family, education, social inclusion, health care and equal opportunities."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"A strong society and economy can only be built on generations and citizens who are sound in body and mind, so we must do our utmost to guarantee the destiny and rights of future generations even in our own interests, since sooner or later we will all depend on the solidarity of future generations."
"Mrs Angelilli therefore deserves recognition for her report, which clarifies the theme in a complex manner."
"The right of our children to a full life is a complicated system of social requirements and legal guarantees: the right of children to be born and brought up in healthy surroundings; their right to study and to make their dreams come true."
"Family and child poverty is a fundamental barrier to enforcing these rights, so it cannot be emphasised enough how crucial it is for the European institutions and Member States to take on a role in the fight against poverty."
"This must also be done to prevent crimes against children and the exploitation of children."
"A borderless Europe entered a new era at the end of last year."
"It is a great challenge for the opening up of the Schengen area not to create favourable opportunities for criminals."
"It would therefore be desirable to design a system to make information on crimes committed against children, and the sentences, available to the Member States and to protect children from criminals being employed within their environment."
"Mrs Angelilli's excellent report will become truly valuable if legislative steps ensue. I trust it will be so."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"(RO) Children's rights are an essential topic uniting us all, irrespective of our country of origin or political viewpoint."
"To speak about children is to speak about our future, the future of European citizens and of the Union itself."
"Therefore I can only welcome the report on the European strategy on children's rights."
"The drafting of the report is in itself a confirmation of the importance of the topic and the text included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as it involved the participation of various committees which contributed six opinions."
"The best interests of the child should be of primary importance."
"Through its values and its concept of development, the European Union has the moral duty to ensure that the rights of the child are a major priority for action, both internally and internationally."
"Within the European Union, I would like to reiterate the importance of two aspects: first of all, the negative consequences of migration and the precarious condition of children left behind in their home countries by migrating parents."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for accepting my suggestion of drawing attention to this issue still affecting European citizens' lives, and I would like to assure him of my support in his appeal for appropriate care, social integration and comprehensive education for these children."
"No less important is the objective of ensuring the right to education for all European children."
"Outside the European Union, it is essential that we promote children's rights on an international level, especially as part of the European Union's relations with its neighbouring countries and its strategic partners."
"Among the diverse situations worldwide, I would like to draw attention to the infringement of children's rights in cases of crisis and conflict, particularly frozen conflicts where the rule of law is simply denied."
"The European Union cannot tolerate such situations and must take firm action to ensure that children's rights are respected everywhere."
"2007 saw the European Union taking decisive steps in this direction, but 2008 will be a crucial year for the actual enforcement of the new strategy concerning children's rights."
"Therefore, I call on the Commission and the Council to give due consideration to the Parliament's recommendations, to ensure that this strategy is a success."
"(ES) Mr President, this report brings a comprehensive, consistent vision to the work we must encourage from European Union level as far as children are concerned."
"We must involve everyone who has responsibilities in this area in making boys' and girls' rights to an equal education effective, combating all types of violence and child labour, and protecting immigrant children."
"Aware of trends in society, we acknowledge that the traditional model of the family cannot be the sole reference-point and that there are increasing numbers of alternative models which we must consider in our deep-seated conviction that children must enjoy a positive family environment."
"On a related issue I would like to raise the initiative on international adoptions where there is a need for regulations which are better tailored to reality and which can address the unknown factors which we are faced with today; such a process is already under way in some States, such as Spain, safeguarding the best interests of minors."
"However, before I finish I should like to express the reservations of the Spanish socialist delegation to paragraph 127, on the ban on the veil in schools, as we are more in favour of dialogue and mediation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing the most vulnerable sector of society, but also a future which needs solid foundations in values such as respect, tolerance and coexistence."
"Mr President, I welcome this report and the work the rapporteur has done on it."
"From listening to the debate, there is almost total agreement on what we need to do when it comes to children's rights, and we have come a long way from the old adage that 'children should be seen and not heard'."
"Today we not only want to see our children but also to hear and listen to what they have to say."
"However, we need some clarification - and perhaps the Commissioner could do that for me - in relation to what competence the EU has in this area of children's rights in the light of the Treaty that has been spoken of and our vote in Ireland on that Reform Treaty."
"As you know, under the Irish Constitution, the rights of children are seen as best protected in the context of the family."
"We need to acknowledge the important role the family plays in protecting children's rights and we need to look at measures aimed at strengthening families and supporting them where that is necessary."
"There is also the question of the marital versus non-marital family and whether there are equal rights for children in both of these situations."
"There is a significant increase in the separated and divorced population in Ireland and an increase in cohabitation of couples: one in twelve families takes this form, with responsibility for 50 000 children."
"We need to look at how the rights of those children are being protected under Irish law as it currently exists."
"There is also an issue about the access of children to both of their parents and the invisibility of children currently under the Irish family law system, and that has to be addressed."
"One last point: there was uproar in 2006 when the Irish Supreme Court struck down the law on statutory rape on the basis that it did not allow an accused individual to enter the defence of honest mistake over a victim's age."
"The case involved a 41-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl."
"Today, ironically in the Dublin district court, sex assault charges against this individual were dropped."
"We are to have two constitutional amendments in Ireland on the issue of the family and the case I just mentioned, and I think we need to see where the EU fits into children's rights so that we vote in Ireland in the right way."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, today's discussion is proof that the European Parliament wants to be involved in the creation of a European policy as regards children."
"For this reason, the view of many Member States that consider that almost all of the regulation concerning the rights of the child belongs in the jurisdiction of family law, and therefore, almost by definition, is exclusively a national responsibility, is very worrying."
"Such a narrow national approach puts the Parliament outside the principal decision-making process as regards the rights of the child and makes us, the Parliament, into a purely advisory body."
"This is not a good approach in a Europe that is becoming increasingly unified."
"An example of this can be the regulation concerning transnational recovery of maintenance claims, which the Parliament approved recently, in December, as a result of a consultation process."
"The purpose of this regulation is to ensure that children who have been forgotten by one of their parents are no longer hungry and abandoned and that they receive the funds that have been recovered thanks to a new and more effective system."
"For this reason I believe that the Parliament, which in fact is acting on behalf of all European children, has a moral obligation to be actively involved in making laws for their benefit."
"To summarise, I would like to say: Commissioner, Parliament should be more involved in European regulations concerning children."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Roberta Angelilli, and the other rapporteurs for their work on this important dossier, and of course to thank Commissioner Frattini for his encouragement for the communication and for the work that has been done by the Commission in this field."
"While recognising that these matters are primarily those for the Member States, there is also, I believe, a role for the European Union, and that of course is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, where, for the first time, the rights of children are embraced."
"I believe that a society is best judged by the way it deals with its innocence and we are, as a European Union, a society."
"The particular interest I have in this field is that of parental child abduction across frontiers."
"I have handled many cases in this sphere and there are several hundred each year between the EU Member States and indeed between EU Member States and our neighbour countries and beyond."
"While there are international conventions like the Hague Convention and, internally, the Brussels II Convention, there are still many deficiencies."
"Recently I was grateful to the international law firm Freshfields for examining several cases under the Brussels II Convention and identifying some of the problems within our own Member States."
"I believe that the work that has been done by the European Parliament and by the Commission needs to be seen in the context of international developments in law."
"I think it is right that the old United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which puts the paramountcy of the interests of the child first, is absolutely crucial."
"In the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the concept of the right of a child to both parents is also introduced."
"That is vital and is now widespread across the world."
"But there are two aspects which turn on the way in which a case is handled by a court."
"Even though this point is not contained within the report in explicit terms, we should also remember the rights of children mature enough for their wishes to be heard by a Court, as in the case of my constituent, 7-year-old Jessica, at the High Court recently."
"Secondly, where appropriate, independent legal representation for the child should be provided."
"These are two elements which I think we need to develop in the coming months."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur for her excellent work."
"The 20th century opened with children having virtually no rights and closed with clear and indisputable advances, yet there is still a long way to go and it will not be easy going, as pointed out in many parts of the report."
"In the short time available, and on the basis also of personal experiences with UNICEF, I would urge the Commission to emphasise one aspect: we need a Community instrument on adoption, for at present the 27 Member States have totally inconsistent legislation in that respect."
"It would be useful to adopt a legislative framework that would help improve the quality of the assistance provided by information services in order to sort out the various steps of preparing for international adoptions and address the procedure governing requests and family support services during the post-adoption stages."
"Today we still encounter far too many abuses, deficiencies, delays and difficulties in this area, which the adopting families and, above all, the children really do not deserve."
"(SK) All Member States ratified the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; however, the Convention does not include any sanctioning mechanism."
"There are several bodies that strive to improve the rights of the child; their activities should be better coordinated and they should receive more publicity, for example through the creation of a shared website."
"That way we could avoid the undesirable duplication of their efforts."
"Another step could be to entrust the Fundamental Rights Commissioner with the protection of children's rights."
"I would welcome the Commissioner being involved, according to priority areas, in the fight against child poverty and against all forms of violence."
"Violence against children should never happen."
"Therefore, in my opinion, it is important not only to punish the perpetrators, but most importantly to prevent such inhumane activity."
"To that effect, I support the rapporteur's request for procedures to improve the extraterritorial prosecutions: in practice this should ensure that a person sentenced in one Member State will be registered as a perpetrator of violence against children in the other Member States too."
"I think that this method will be an important step in the prevention of further abuse of children, such as sexual mutilation, sexual abuse, child pornography, kidnapping and trafficking."
"As far as child pornography is concerned, I am very much in favour of the European Commission's initiative, in cooperation with some banking institutions and credit card companies, to try to exclude pages that sell child pornography from online payment systems."
"This activity could help in the creation of a database of child pornography traders, from which information on the creators and propagators of this repulsive form of trade would be available to the police of the relevant Member State, Europol and Interpol."
"Because I am aware that this is a very important area, I am in favour of the necessary human and financial resources being set aside for the protection of the rights of the child."
"It is a question of the future of our children, which means our future."
"(EL) Mr President, I in turn would like to give my congratulations to Mrs Angelilli, who has indeed provided an integrated framework for consolidating the Charter on the Rights of the Child."
"I would like to focus my comments on three issues, beyond those which have already been discussed here."
"First, there must be a prompt diagnosis and response to the problem of violence and abuse against children, with the establishment of a special record-keeping system, which will progressively contribute towards effective prevention of the problem."
"Second, the adoption by all the Member States of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in and Sexual Exploitation of Persons, where, amongst other things, it will be necessary to review the question of issuing temporary or non-permanent permits for residence within their borders."
"Lastly, the issue of substantial management of the problem of criminality among minors, with measures for prevention and social integration of minors, and measures of judicial and extrajudicial intervention."
"Mr President, this is the Year of Intercultural Dialogue, and we must maintain the connecting bridges between all cultures and all religious views."
"I think paragraph 127 of this report cannot be accepted."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the destiny of Europe is affected significantly by whether it is capable of developing societies that include and support children."
"Supporting and protecting children's rights is crucial to the future of the European Union."
"The development of child-friendly societies in the Union cannot be separated from the further deepening and strengthening of European integration."
"A comprehensive EU strategy is needed to promote and ensure the effective enforcement of children's rights both inside and outside the Union."
"Children deserve special provisions and appropriate legal protection."
"The Member States are responsible for supporting parents in their child-rearing duties in many ways."
"A safe and inclusive Europe can only be built using these instruments."
"Our policies should constantly bear in mind the diversity and different needs of children, paying particular attention to poverty, social exclusion, and negative discrimination both at Union and at global level."
"I consider it important that the recommendations of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child be consistently and systematically taken into account within the framework of bilateral agreements concluded by the EU with countries outside the EU."
"The PSE Group would like a separate vote on amendment 127."
"Mr President, I welcome the decision to incorporate children's rights as one of the objectives of the EU Treaty of Lisbon, providing a new legal basis for children's rights."
"Ms Angelilli's report deals with many important issues relating to children's well-being and protection."
"However, I want to emphasise acknowledgement of the fact that, for children, the poverty and social exclusion of their parents represent serious obstacles to exercising their rights."
"I support the report's demand that the EU work in cooperation with the relevant UN agencies, international organisations and research centres to improve the gathering of comparable statistical data on the situation of children in the EU, with a view to developing and including a larger number of indicators relating specifically to children, child poverty and social exclusion."
"Child poverty is a neglected issue, yet one in five children in the EU lives on the brink of poverty."
"Will this not condemn 20% of the EU's future adults to never fulfilling their true potential?"
"If the political will is there, then let us work together across Member States to share best practice and learn from one another."
"We have witnessed the EU-wide campaign to make poverty in the developing world history, so why can we not have a similar campaign, across the EU, to make child poverty history?"
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the initiative that has been put before us concerning a strategy on the rights of the child is a signal not just for Europe, but for the whole world, as to how the rights of the youngest members of society should be protected."
"For this reason I would like to give my appreciation to Mrs Angelilli for an excellent report."
"Unfortunately, instances of violations of the rights of minors often occur in certain parts of Europe - in Europe, where we are so proud of our highly developed system for the protection of human rights."
"For this reason we must ensure that children who are experiencing various humiliations know that there is someone to whom they can turn to for help and who will give them this help."
"I would like therefore to support the call of the author of the report for the creation of more effective monitoring, as well as the European Commission's idea for putting into place a telephone helpline for children in need of assistance."
"Another important issue is that of children from poor, immigrant or refugee families."
"They are suffering for reasons that are outside of their control and, as a result, are often condemned to a worse life than that experienced by their contemporaries who have not had to flee their own countries."
"For this reason I would like to support the proposal to grant them full rights, whatever the legal situation of their parents, and also give them equal access to education."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank all the speakers, and I am also glad they have recognised that the Commission and Parliament are, for the first time in Europe and even before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, jointly formulating a genuine, horizontal European policy in all areas for the protection and promotion of the rights of the child."
"That is a political achievement on an issue that was not on the European agenda until two years ago and it is, therefore, also a response to those who were aware of the need for practical results."
"Europe is moving forward in this area."
"I was very pleased with what Mr McMillan had to say."
"One of the main criteria for evaluating the degree of civilisation of a country is the way it treats its youngest members, its children; the Member States of the European Union and all of us Europeans aspire to lead the world in terms of the way we treat children and the opportunities we offer them."
"Many issues have been addressed, and some already feature in the proposal I submitted and in the very useful recommendations set out by Mrs Angelilli, yet I believe there are other points that need to be looked at in more detail in the coming months."
"Let us make 2008 the year of further progress with this European strategy."
"Mrs Gál and Mrs Sinnot, addressing the role of the family, made it very clear that many of the problems we encounter stem from a view of the role of the family that is outdated and not what it ought to be."
"We looked into that last year, as you will remember, in relation to violent video games; a statistical survey in Europe showed that only 20% of respondents were interested in how their children used the Internet and came across or used video games."
"That means that 80% of parents surveyed were not aware what type of electronic games or Internet sites their children were visiting."
"That shows why the family, as has been said, is the key place where we must promote the rights of the child."
"Mr Catania and others spoke on the question of child labour."
"You will remember that, in the proposal I put forward on imposing severe penalties on those who exploit the illegal work of legal immigrants, I particularly condemned the use of migrant children, who are both vulnerable because they are migrants and exploited because they are working illegally; they are particularly vulnerable because children should not work but should go to school."
"If that proposal, which is on the table, is adopted it will become a European directive and will, therefore, legally compel Member States to introduce rules of a kind we unfortunately do not yet have ."
"The question of unaccompanied migrant children is an important one, and we are discussing ways of financing targeted projects, for we have discovered situations that really are tragic, in addition to those that have been mentioned."
"In the Canaries, for example, the Spanish Government has discovered very worrying cases, which we must obviously address, of the arrival of large numbers of children who are unaccompanied because their parents have simply sent them off alone."
"That is quite shocking in itself."
"We must strengthen European legislation to combat violence against children, as Mrs Segelström made quite clear."
"There is one very serious issue that concerns me personally."
"There are rules to ensure that one of the two parents is effectively granted custody of a child in the event of separation or divorce."
"In fact, in many Member States the rules in force are not applied in practice; that is not to say that the governments are not applying them, but often the magistrates and courts are scarcely aware of them."
"There are cases where one parent actually steals the child from the other parent."
"In some cases it proves impossible to enforce the decisions, which is why we must put much more emphasis on this question in the context of allocating the custody of minors."
"Sex tourism is another area to be addressed, including cooperation among public authorities and private individuals, tourist agencies and credit card companies, to help us to identify people who buy child pornography material on the Internet."
"Clearly the paedophiles do not pay cash, they pay by credit card."
"If we have that cooperation, which we are making a start on, then we will also be able to reduce and put a stop to the tragedy of sex tourism."
"A new area is the right to grow up in a non-polluted environment, the environmental rights of the child."
"We must focus on it closely because it is not just a new area but one that we must quite clearly all address."
"Mrs Harkin was one of those who raised the question of the effect of the Lisbon Treaty."
"That Treaty does not introduce a specific legal basis, but gives the value of a European policy to the strategy we are discussing here today and which hitherto was based on a common political resolve."
"With the Lisbon Treaty, we can now regard the strategy for the protection of children as truly European, which is a quite extraordinary step forward."
"In conclusion, over the coming months we must work on this subject and it is clear that in this way Europe is investing in its future."
"It is investing in its young people, investing for children."
"However, I see another area in which children could be actively involved in one of the European Union's most important policies: the policy of integrating immigrant communities."
"If we placed our trust in children, in the smallest children at school, and made them ambassadors of integration - given that they find it much easier to play or learn side by side with children from different cultures and backgrounds - we will have given children the job, as someone said, not of being mini-adults, but of being genuinely actively involved in integration policy."
"For if that policy is not based on integrating children at school it will never be a genuine policy of integrating immigrants who come from other countries."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all let me once again thank Commissioner Frattini for reiterating the European Commission's serious commitment to the sector of the rights of the child."
"I thank him also for calling on Member States, in his opening statement, rapidly to activate the child helplines, for the delays here are indeed unjustifiable."
"I am also grateful to him for pointing out that not all Member States have to date introduced a national guarantee in relation to the rights of the child, something we also noted and deplored in the report."
"I am also grateful to all my colleagues who played a part in the drafting of this document, and to those who have spoken, for I believe we are all agreed on the concept of the higher interest of the child."
"Obviously, I support that and share the concerns that have been expressed in the Chamber today."
"We must force our Member States to move more quickly from words to deeds and obviously Parliament and the European Commission must do their part too."
"Let me say a few brief words on some of the issues that were highlighted."
"On the environment, let me confirm to Mr Frattini that it is true that we could perhaps have done more in the report, but we did make it clear that the right to a healthy and clean environment must be one of the main rights guaranteed to minors."
"I was pleased to find that one of the issues that will be addressed at the next European Forum on the rights of the child will be the question of international adoptions."
"In that context I also want to point out that aside from the enormous and often entirely bureaucratic difficulties of international adoptions, there also is the tragedy of children who are fought over by their parents following separation or divorce."
"That is indeed a major European problem, which has obviously also grown as a result of opening up borders."
"Let me conclude by saying that I am of course very pleased with the work that has been done, and although I believe the result is certainly not perfect, it can be a very good point of departure provided, I repeat, that serious and responsible practical action is taken promptly."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - Educational segregation is one of the most harmful forms of discrimination faced by Roma children."
"As a basic human right, education is crucial for the attainment of other human rights, and investment in early childhood education for Roma is a policy that functions on multiple levels and benefits more than the children it aims to educate."
"The benefits of early education include: the promotion of social equity, increased individual and broader social productivity, reduced levels of poverty, and the elimination of discriminatory attitudes and social exclusion."
"As Roma children become more educated, they increase their chances of becoming productive members of the workforce."
"While they earn money and contribute to the national budget through taxes on both income and consumption, they begin to influence the way in which non-Roma view them, thereby affecting broader social issues."
"Also, as Roma become more productive and their poverty level decreases, they also become contributing members of society instead of beneficiaries of public aid."
"The combination of the increased contribution and the decreased benefits paid out by the government is the net budgetary benefit to the national budget."
"A program that supported these developments would benefit all Europeans and not only the Roma."
"in writing. - (FI) One of the most fundamental structures underlying common European values is our duty to protect innocent souls, by which I mean children."
"On few matters can we be so unanimous."
"It is vital that children's rights are protected more effectively than is the case at present, and that also applies at Community level."
"The Commission's communication on establishing a strategy on protecting the rights of children was very welcome."
"Parliament's report on the strategy is an excellent one."
"I would like to raise a few points on this broad issue."
"Firstly, the status of families is directly connected with the rights of children."
"The family is indisputably the best environment for a child."
"The family and the protection of family life are, in fact, children's rights, and these are realised when a family is managing well."
"The strategy should also include measures to promote the well-being of families."
"A child's right of access to both parents should be protected at all costs."
"Children are exposed very early on to horrific, violent and sexual forms of entertainment, with disastrous consequences."
"The proposal in the report, for example, to create a uniform classification and labelling system in the EU for the sale and distribution of audiovisual content and video games intended for minors is a worthy one."
"The polluter pays principle should operate in violent forms of commercial entertainment because the damage done is enormous."
"Thirdly, determined efforts should be made to eradicate child pornography."
"Priorities for the Commission are to strengthen cross-border operations to close down websites that oppress children and to improve cooperation between public authorities and the private sector."
"Regrettably, children's rights do not escape the general spirit of the relativity of values that tends to exist in society."
"We need to say out loud what is definitely not relative."
"The rights and protection of children lie at the heart of human values, which is why we still need to remind people of the dire consequences that await wrongdoers."
"in writing. - (HU) The European Union has a special responsibility to protect fundamental human rights, above all the rights of children."
"Despite this, 19% of children in the Union live with the risk of poverty, and this number is higher than for the adult population (15%)."
"Worldwide, 40 million children under the age of 12 are subject to some kind of act of violence."
"Nearly 6 million are in forced labour; one and a half million become victims of human traffickers."
"Against this background, a European strategy of zero tolerance that aims to protect the rights of children is of very great importance."
"I feel that a key role in this can be played by better legal regulation, including an investigation into the impact on minors of the new and existing rules."
"I do not, however, support the creation of a separate parliamentary body with responsibility for children's rights."
"Any tasks of such a body can be performed by the children's rights coordinator appointed by the Commission."
"I do, however, support the creation of a post of Commissioner for human rights and minorities, who would also be responsible for protecting the rights of children."
"It is important to note that the majority of children living in disadvantaged circumstances are of Roma origin, or belong to the minority living in Europe."
"It would also be advisable to implement European institutional reforms under which the children's rights coordinators reporting to the Commissioner would provide links between institutions, NGOs and governments, to give continuous dialogue and cooperation."
"With regard to the fact that there are already many European organisations and institutions within the Union that deal with children's rights, we must place the emphasis on uniting the old ones and making them operate more effectively, rather than creating new ones."
"Besides the protection of children's rights, the issue of education is becoming more and more topical."
"Attentive education allows uninformed young offenders to grow into informed, law-abiding citizens."
"I would be making an omission if, in the context of this debate on children's rights, I did not speak about the case of Shaun Attard, which broke the hearts of the people of Malta and Gozo."
"This Gozitan child was taken from his father in a manner that surely had a psychological effect on him."
"It is possible that the law is being observed in this case and that the European directives are being respected."
"However, there are considerable doubts as to whether what is taking place is really in the best interests of this child."
"I regret to say that from what I can see, the British authorities are making it difficult for the child's father to have a fair hearing of this case."
"Even the few contacts between the child and the father are full of obstacles."
"I would like to appeal that, while the law is to be observed, Mario Attard is given a fair hearing and, moreover, serious consideration is given to Shaun's best interests."
"in writing. - (PL) Today's debate concerning the rights of the child raises many fundamental questions concerning the proper development of our young people."
"The future of our children, ensuring they can develop properly, is the issue that determines the future of our continent as regards proper interpersonal relationships."
"The rights of the child must be respected."
"The rights of parents to bring them up in accordance with the values they believe in must also be respected."
"To speak about the rights of the child and to leave out the issue of their right to be brought up in natural families, where there is a father and a mother, is a violation of their rights."
"Surely a decision about a child's adoption, where the child is handed over to a couple of the same sex, and thus deciding about the child's future destiny, and, in a way, forcing a sexual orientation on them is a violation of the child's fundamental rights."
"We cannot remain silent on this issue, just because it violates EU political correctness."
"Disturbing situation regarding waste in the Campania region (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on the disturbing situation regarding waste in the Campania region."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, honourable members of the European Parliament, the refuse which has been accumulating in the streets of Naples and neighbouring towns since 21 December, as the media inform us, is estimated to have exceeded the huge quantity of 100,000 tonnes. This, in combination with the negative - I would say catastrophic - effects for residents and the environment, is a cause for grave concern."
"The crisis in recent days in Naples did not come from nowhere."
"It is the culmination of deficient enforcement of European legislation on refuse over the past 14 years, for which Italy has been repeatedly condemned by the Court of the European Communities."
"Beyond the role of organised crime which is emphasised by the press, a direct cause of the present crisis appears to be inaction and lack of will to adopt the measures necessary for solving the chronic problem of waste management."
"When the Commission was first informed of the crisis in the refuse collection and disposal system in Campania, in the spring of 2007, proceedings were initiated against Italy for contravention of Community legislation on refuse."
"Since then, the Commission has been observing developments at first hand and has already come to an initial on-the-spot assessment of the situation, at the request of the Italian government."
"A further meeting with the competent Italian authorities is due to take place in the next few days."
"It is the responsibility of the Italian authorities to take immediate measures to clear the refuse from the streets."
"But as this new crisis shows, it is not enough merely to remove the refuse from the streets."
"Any short-term measures must be supplemented by the adoption and, most important, the effective implementation of long-term strategic measures."
"For example, an adequate network of waste processing facilities fully complying with the standards laid down by Community legislation."
"This must be accompanied by an integrated long-term strategy of waste management with the aim of promoting recycling and sorting of refuse upon collection."
"Legislative Decree no. 61, issued in May 2007 to solve the refuse crisis, did not achieve its aim."
"The emergency plan announced by Prime Minister Prodi on 8 January is a more ambitious effort in this direction, but a crucial element remains the timing of the measures, which must be swift and effective."
"We shall continue to monitor closely the implementation of the measures in practice by the Italian authorities."
"The Commission will continue to exert pressure on the Italian government to end the crisis, and intends to proceed with the legal action against Italy."
"The continual violations of Community environmental legislation in Campania must finally be brought to an end, as Community law requires."
"Although the situation appears to be difficult, it is not impossible for the Italian authorities to comply with Community legislation on refuse."
"I am sure that useful examples can be drawn, not only from other Member States but also from other regions of Italy, where solutions have been found for the controlled disposal of waste by a combination of different types of volume reduction, collection and disposal."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say at once to the Commissioner that while I endorse what he said, I believe the situation is not so much difficult as dramatic."
"I could confine my statement to quoting from the article in The Economist a few days ago."
"'Garbage littered on city streets can be not only unhealthy but also politically hazardous."
"It reminds voters of the fragility of civilisation - and can prompt them to turn on their elected representatives.'"
"That is the situation."
"As everybody knows, Naples is famous for the film The Four Days of Naples, in which the local people rise up against the foreign invaders."
"One newspaper wrote that the enemies in the land today are the people who sullied Naples' good reputation in the world."
"A whole civilisation is being consumed."
"The tragedy of the waste in Naples and Campania did not strike overnight but has been building up for 14 years; EUR 8 billion have been spent uselessly and TV pictures have shown Europe and the entire world how the city streets have become quite impassable."
"The real tragedy began, as the Commissioner pointed out, on 21 December, when the municipal dust carts stopped their rounds because the tips were full to overflowing and there are no incinerators; there are impending health risks, and absolutely nobody, Commissioner, is talking about separate collection."
"There are, in fact, no incinerators in Campania and waste management is in the hands of organised crime, the Camorra."
"The Campania region has not managed to tackle a problem that, in short, is a question of ordinary administration, such as cleaning the city, because it did not wish to do so, because the regional administration and its president are the slaves of the organised crime that controls all business."
"Some of the political forces that form part of Mr Prodi's government and all the opposition parties have called for the Regional Council to be dissolved and for the appointment of a commissioner with sweeping powers, as a reaction against the irresponsible Minister for the Environment, Pecoraro Scanio."
"A mere 81% of the EUR 200 million contribution under the European plan for the period 1994-1999 has been used; there is no regional plan and so someone had to be sent in."
"I hope the President will allow me to speak for a few moments more."
"Under this arrangement contracts can be awarded without respecting the appropriate European regulations, which creates a vicious circle of illegality and inefficiency."
"The real risk is of losing the EUR 330 million Structural Fund money."
"The Commission has opened an infringement procedure against Italy; that was, unfortunately, inevitable, for certainly Campania is light years away from complying with the rules imposed by the European directives, which those in charge even in the government have disregarded."
"We ask the Commission to carry out an inspection at the end of the month and to take a strong position on enforcing the use of incinerators."
"That is something Europe can do and we also call on Parliament to carry out an inspection, for a qualitative leap (...)."
"Before continuing the debate, I must advise you on the new procedures."
"First of all I would ask Members to adhere to the rules on speaking time."
"Secondly I would point out that under the 'catch the eye' procedure Members who believe they have not used up their entire speaking time may ask to speak again."
"Obviously they will be given the floor after it has been given to Members speaking for the first time."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank you for your clear, precise and effective statement, for the concern you have shown tonight and over the past days and weeks, for your reprimands that we endorse, aware as we are that it is absolutely necessary to respect European laws."
"We believe that the European Parliament must never turn into a sounding board for national diatribes, especially on such sensitive questions and dramatic issues."
"Rather, we think that it is precisely because of the dramatic nature of this situation that we must call for serious analyses, both of this specific case and of the issue of waste in general, which is not a concern only for Naples and Campania but something every community has to tackle."
"It is an issue that calls into question a development model that often sacrifices man and the environment to the logic of profit, an issue that is often addressed in terms of ideologies and the false opposition between soulless industrialism and environmentalism that puts a stop to development."
"We must not forget that Italy was one of the first countries, in 1997, under the government of Mr Prodi and with Mr Ronchi as minister, to pass a modern law that is consistent with what the European Union has been saying for some time: environmental education, separate collection, security measures, use of advanced recycling and reuse methods that are safe for people and the environment."
"That law has also been applied excellently and has also been a source of economic growth and employment."
"That has not been the case in Campania, however."
"What went wrong?"
"What did not work?"
"There is no doubt that political responsibility for what happened can be assigned as much to the right as to the left, especially as regards management by those put in charge."
"It is not up to us at this moment to ascertain whether the responsibility might also be of a different kind, and severe penalties should be imposed if that is the case, but we would not be honest if we blamed politics alone."
"In Campania, many other factors played a decisive, negative role, such as organised crime, a weak civic sense, a historical lack of infrastructure."
"The Italian government is responding to the immediate situation, taking important decisions and endeavouring to restore responsibility to local authorities, moving away from the system of sending in special commissioners and ensuring self-sufficiency in waste disposal."
"Those decisions will allow us to look more confidently to the present and the future - I'm just finishing, Mr President - and I believe that they will also make it possible to give a convincing response to legitimate European concerns."
"We must now support those decisions; we must restore dignity to a city, a region and a country, to Italy, which, in Mr Napolitano's words, is not short of positive energy, of forces of innovation."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must resist the temptation to exploit this issue and instead let objectivity and intellectual honesty prevail, without disregarding the disputes surrounding it."
"The problem is this: the interest of organised crime and its infiltration into waste management, which has resulted in countless illegal dumps scattered over the Campania region; the constant acceptance of dangerous and toxic waste from other regions, especially northern Italy; the weakness of the local authorities; the cultural backwardness of the population in its approach to waste as a resource; the vetoes relating to the siting of various waste disposal plant, even by representatives of the local Catholic Church; the divisions not only in political but also in scientific circles regarding, for example, disposal methods; the inadequate technology chosen for the planned end-disposal plant following a European call for tenders in Campania in 1998."
"Today we have massive state intervention."
"Politicians, all politicians, have finally understood that more needs to be done; for over the past 14 years, whether as a member of the government or the opposition, whether at local, regional or national level, none of the political parties has managed to come up with firm, determined and coherent answers."
"We therefore appreciate the great gesture of solidarity several Italian regions, including those from the centre-right, have made to support Campania at this extremely serious time, helping it to restore the image it deserves in terms of the attractions of its culture and landscape, productive resources and talents."
"This is not the moment for those who bear primary responsibility and are to blame for the entire policy to evade or deny it."
"It is the moment to assume responsibility, which is why I appreciate the approach Commissioner Dimas took in his statement, a constructive approach that sees Europe as not just imposing sanctions, confining itself to sanctions, but as also helping a Member State to resolve a crisis."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the waste problem in Campania is no longer just a health and environmental disaster, but is becoming an economic and institutional whodunit."
"While the judiciary will shed light, we hope, on the economic whodunit, we need further enlightenment as regards the institutional whodunit."
"On 11 September 2007, the Commission, in reply to a question from me, said it was concerned but hopeful that the urgent measures taken by the Italian authorities would help to resolve the situation and also said that it would take the measures set out in Article 226 of the Treaty if the investigation under way brought to light infringements of the law."
"On 2 January 2008, however, the Commission's spokesperson said that infringement proceedings against Italy had been opened in June 2007."
"Where does the truth lie?"
"In what was said in reply to me on 11 September or in what was said by the spokesperson?"
"Why did the Commission make no mention of these infringement proceedings in its reply?"
"The fact that some European political groups, close to the Prodi government, have come out against a joint resolution on the health and environmental disaster in Campania which should have concluded our debate opens up another whodunit."
"When there are more coincidences than might normally be expected, it is highly likely that an interest is being defended, and when the political interest, however unconsciously, espouses other interests, which coincide, moreover, with those of the 'eco-mafias', the question is no longer one of left or right or merely of political incapacity."
"We strongly suspect that the European institutions have been intentionally misled for reasons connected with partisan interests."
"The high levels of dioxin in the area, the persisting illegality of the situation, the keenness for Parliament to abandon its responsibility for a joint resolution, are bound up with the political choices of the Italian Government, the Region of Campania and the Naples local authority which, coincidentally, come from the same political mould."
"We call for urgent action by OLAF to monitor the use of the funds appropriated up to now and to ensure that future funds are correctly managed."
"We call on the Commission to explain to Parliament, within thirty days from now, where the responsibility for this disgraceful and tragic emergency that is no longer regional, but national and European, lies, and to whom it can be attributed."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should very much like to thank Commissioner Dimas for the action that he has taken in recent weeks and months, action that many environmentalists would also like to see on other occasions, firm and visible action that is to be welcomed by all those working to defend Community legislation."
"In my view, that has not always been the case, and I would point out that, as regards the application of Community legislation, a number of infringements have also been opened by his institution in previous years - especially during the term of the government preceding that in office today - which have unfortunately gone largely unheeded and which have in particular been treated as mere routine."
"I should like to cite the infringements in respect of unauthorised waste dumps - of which there are over 4 000 - and a whole series of other questions connected with the definition of waste and so on."
"All this led to the situation in which we find ourselves today."
"Clearly, when a Member State and when a government which, at the time, had a majority of a hundred or so, failed to do more, as regards legislation on waste, than simply breach Community directives in its attempt to find loopholes, there is a much greater likelihood of maladministration, mismanagement, crime and a total lack of compliance."
"I am therefore very grateful to the Commission for its action, and I hope that it will press on with its monitoring work, because I believe that that work will be necessary;"
"I also think that a shift away from crisis management is an absolute prerequisite if this situation is to be resolved."
"I am also of the view that the question as to who is responsible is an important one."
"There, I concur with those who say that the Commission should also introduce methods through which funds that have been spent and are to be spent can be monitored, because I believe that for us all as European and not just as Italian citizens, the issue of how funds can be used in a clear-cut way is an absolutely key question which concerns every one of us."
"Nevertheless, I take the view that the Italian Government's measures, especially those announced for the next three or four months, must be supported, although the rules of the game have to be clear and also have to be respected."
"In my view, it would be very sad indeed to find ourselves in a situation where crisis is met with crisis, infringing the rules, because it is such infringements that have brought us to the point at which we now find ourselves."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the substance of what Commissioner Dimas has said, reminding us all of our responsibilities and pointing us in the right direction; he reminds us that the way in which the problems should be addressed is one of compliance with European rules, moving away from crisis management approaches which create new crises."
"For that reason, this debate is important because it can and must help us to try to resolve the appalling waste problems facing Naples and Campania."
"What is urgent is not so much political polemics, but the removal of the waste which creates hazardous conditions for local residents."
"The government is taking steps to do so, but an effective solution will then need to be found and it will be vital for that solution to be based on European rules."
"European rules, as the Commissioner has pointed out, are clear, have been consolidated over many years and are confirmed in the new framework directive which we are discussing."
"When tackling the issue of waste there is a hierarchy, and according to that hierarchy, reduction comes first, followed by separate collection, then re-use and recycling, and disposal only as a last resort, where it is absolutely necessary."
"Italy is trying too hard to stay within these guidelines and in Naples and Campania the situation has worsened."
"However, there are problems elsewhere as well, as can be seen from the infringements: too many instances of the authorities sending in special commissioners, too much confusion between the regulations on waste and on energy, leading to unacceptable practices, for instance the practice under which the energy produced from waste has for years been considered in Italy as renewable energy with enormous incentives - EUR 30 billion over ten years, under a measure known as CIP 6 - which have seriously distorted both energy policies and waste policies and have also led to somewhat paradoxical situations where, for instance, there are seven million tonnes of waste fuel pellets in Campania which, even if the incinerator which should dispose of them were to open, could not be burnt in it."
"Too many derogations from European environmental laws."
"I cannot say too often that the crisis has brought about new crises."
"We must now bring the situation into line with the rules, and I truly believe that the government is keen to do so, and those rules are European rules, from assessment of environmental impact to the hierarchy of waste."
"For that reason, today's debate cannot be a platform for polemics, but an opportunity for dialogue with the Commissioner to promote such a relationship between Europe and the Member States."
"I repeat: first the hierarchy, so that jointly agreed rules can be applied in the best possible way."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what right does the Italian left, egged on by the European left, have to make us talk about the disgraceful waste crisis in Campania for which the centre-left has been responsible for decades without voting on it."
"The same left that is inflicting global warming on us and cannot be bothered to ensure a high-quality environment and a decent life for millions of residents of Campania; to top it all, I have heard talk of a national interest to be defended!"
"It is those same supporters of the national interest that a couple of years ago brought Italy, its government and the forces of order into disrepute with the debate and vote on the legendary Lampedusa case."
"I hope at least that this House becomes more aware and better informed about a question which is not just Italian, and unreservedly condemns what is happening by voting in line with my request, as head of Azione della Fiamma as well, to apply all possible sanctions against the regional and the national government which, although responsible, seem utterly incapable of resolving this long-standing issue and are failing to take the dignified route of resignation."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Naples is serious largely because time has been wasted rather than trying to do something about the guilty verdict handed down by Court of Justice and thus ensuring that waste is managed in line with European legislation, something which we greatly regret."
"If we want to prevent the crisis in Campania from spreading to other regions, action has to be taken by applying the European rules, building waste to energy plant - despite the barely credible resistance from some pseudo-environmentalists such as Minister Pecoraro Scanio - and promoting separate collection."
"Campania does not, however, mirror the whole of Italy, and fortunately many regions such as Lombardy have made considerable progress and have set up efficient waste collection and disposal systems."
"In other regions, however, there is much cause for concern."
"The public is worried; and that is certainly true in Rome and Lazio."
"Some figures: quantities of waste are greater than in Naples and Campania; 4 500 tonnes of refuse are collected every day in Rome in comparison with 1 000 in Naples, with a figure of 450 kg per capita in Campania in comparison with 617 kg in Lazio, well above the national average of 539 kg for an Italian."
"All this is contained in a question which we have just tabled with Rome's other elected parliamentarians."
"However, the regional waste plan has never got off the ground and two infringement procedures have already been opened."
"Alarmed residents are putting their trust in the European institutions, especially Parliament and the Commission."
"For that reason, Commissioner, we entreat you to ensure, at the meeting of 28 January, that the Commission obtains data and information on the situation in Rome and Lazio, giving prior notice of an inspection, we hope by Commissioner Dimas, and also proposing an inspection by a delegation from this Parliament, to assess whether the measures for 2008, I am concluding, are adequate."
"Action has to be taken, Commissioner, before it is too late."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, never mind, Mr President, it is not the first time."
"Commissioner, on 28 January, when, as has been pointed out, you will be in Rome for discussions with our government, it is essential for Italy - and I believe for Europe - for the Commission to take a very harsh stance in support of the workings of European justice."
"You have pointed out, I remember, that Italy holds a record: that of judgments against that pile of rubbish that is Italian justice, with twenty years of futile reprimands."
"There is only one problem: we have a torrent of illegality which necessarily means lives destroyed and even worse destruction, not just in Italy, and what I therefore hope, Commissioner, is that the Commission will bear in mind that there we have the proof that Italy, as in the 1920s, is taking a new and different path, is becoming a threat to the whole of our Europe, that country which (...)."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current waste crisis in Campania is a tragedy that has long been coming, and those mountains of refuse that can be seen in the streets are only the tip of an iceberg made up of inefficiency, waste and mismanagement."
"We are unhappy that this crisis is damaging the reputation not just of the Region of Campania but of Italy as a whole, but keeping quiet again about who is responsible and turning a blind eye would do little to resolve a problem which has worsened because of silence and intrigue, and although people should not used as political pawns, nor do I think that the do-gooder attitude that is also creeping round this House this evening is acceptable either."
"We can no longer stay silent or justify, and neither did the Court of Auditors, the fact that millions of euro, of European, national and local funds have gone up in smoke."
"To whom should people turn for compensation for the damages caused by this environmental disaster, for the tarnished image and for the waste of public resources?"
"In particular, what action does the Commission intend to take actively to force the Italian State to take adequate measures, bearing in mind that the children of Naples and Campania have not gone to school today either?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his lucid analysis."
"In Naples, and in large parts of Campania, the waste situation has now deteriorated and the consequences can be seen by all, but there are problems in other areas as well, as can be seen from the number of infringement procedures that Italy has collected in the environmental field in recent years."
"Among these, I should like to cite the notorious CIP6 under which the energy produced from waste has been considered to be renewable energy with the result that enormous incentives have been diverted away from policies to develop renewable energies and handed out to the powerful industrial lobbies, leading to serious waste management problems."
"What is making the situation in Campania even more dramatic are the 14 years of intrigue and irresponsibility culminating in the first proceedings against businesses and representatives of the public institutions, and ultimately the proceedings against Impregilo at the European Court, for environmental disaster."
"If the crisis is to be resolved there has to be a new style of government of the area: no more derogations, but applications of European laws."
"Europe has set a clear-cut hierarchy in the new framework directive on waste."
"Disposal is to be used only as a last resort and comes after separate collection, recycling and so on."
"Now, however, we have to find a way out of a situation which may well be reaching a point of no return in Campania, and it is for that reason that we need to mobilise all the available resources and call upon the solidarity of the Italian regions and on aid from the EU so that immediate action can be taken in the next three or four months to eliminate the dangers faced by residents and to return Naples to Europe."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from Padania the situation in Campania seems like science fiction, from a Padania where separate collections are made, where taxes on waste are paid."
"The fact that the left in government in our country, with a green environment minister, moreover, has to put the former chief of police in charge of waste, seems like something from another world."
"We tell you plainly that Campania is no longer in the European legal space, dominated as it is by a shameful connection between politics and the Camorra which we have long denounced."
"Commissioner, no more funding, suspend all funding, do not send a further cent to the Camorra, to the criminals."
"Take the hard-working and honest North as an example!"
"Free the honest people of Campania from the thrall of the Camorra, in which various parties are caught up!"
"We want nothing to do with this, we are against this domination of politics by the mafia."
"Federalism is what our country needs, if these people are to be helped!"
"There has to be change, the situation has to change!"
"Free those honest working people of the South from the yoke of the mafia!"
"That is what honest Padania has to say!"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider that Italy has no wish whatsoever to abide by what are European laws."
"This is borne out by the fact that it was the only country whose government, with a green environment minister, abstained from the approval in Council of the common position on the recent waste directive."
"I should like to ask a question, because over and above the disaster of a green minister who is utterly irresponsible and lacks any certainty about his actions, there has also been little interest in monitoring by the European Commission, because we received funds in 2000-2006 and the Regional Operational Programmes in Campania have obviously been implemented without the monitoring committee carrying out its tasks in full, otherwise it would have blocked funds which had had no effective impact in the area."
"Perhaps it is unnecessary to point out who was President of the European Commission at that time and who is now Prime Minister of Italy, with a green minister?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations on this new form of democracy."
"Firstly, congratulations on the Commissioner's lucid analysis which we hope will be followed by concrete action, action in which Parliament - and we also call on the President of Parliament here - will also be involved, because the waste problem in Naples does not just have to do with the minutiae of disposal, the environment and any other matter, but, in our view, is becoming a national and European problem."
"Some very short points: the amount of waste which is now being collected from the streets is well below the amount being put on the streets; the measures that the government is taking are therefore completely inadequate."
"The mass of waste, the overall quantity of waste grows by the hour, making the situation ever more dramatic."
"Secondly, a political point."
"Mr Pittella said that Parliament should not become a sounding board for national diatribes."
"In this evening's debate, the centre-left seems to be doing exactly that."
"Let us take note of his comments."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have asked to speak because I am very concerned about the direction the debate is taking in Italy and to some extent here, and also about the information that is being given to citizens, because it now appears that a magic solution is the only way out of this crisis: force and militarisation, on the one hand, and incinerators, on the other."
"The public is hoping, therefore, that someone will come in from outside to resolve this problem; the information they are being given does not focus on the fact that there will be no solution unless waste is reduced and sorted and civic behaviour changes."
"That is the responsibility of the local authorities because they thought that the problems could be solved by delegating them to a firm called Impregilo."
"They have passed the buck and have connived with and are in the thrall of that power."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, waste to energy units are operational in Italy and the rest of Europe."
"Separate collections are made in Italy and the rest of Europe."
"Recycling takes place in Italy and the rest of Europe."
"Only in Naples has this not been the case for at least the last 15 years, under the noses of all the institutions which should have acted: those institutions include Europe and the Commission."
"I take the view that little has been done and more needs to be done, by the Commission as well, because the initiatives taken up to now, including in recent days, by the government are completely ineffectual and unfit for purpose."
"Sending the chief of police to Naples for only four months will not resolve any problem unless Naples complies with all the European laws, and if the Italian Government is unable to make it comply, let the European Commission do so with all the instruments that it has available."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am of the view that harking back to the past is helpful only if the future is used to put an end to the problems that the past has caused."
"This does not seem to be happening, however, because here, as is usual, the cut and thrust of politics means that everyone is taking the position that best suits them."
"My view is that the only serious step we can take is to ask the Commissioner to insist that the real problem is finally resolved, i.e. the problem of separate collection, with instruments that enable it, rewards for those who carry it out and an extraordinary plan for the collection of board and other materials."
"CONAI, the body which brings together producers and users of packaging, which is responsible for re-use of material other than wet waste, ends up by collecting the price in the South and then paying it to the North, which as usual profits from the situation to drain funds from the South and send them to the North."
"Let there be an end to it!"
"We therefore ask the Commissioner, whose initiatives we greatly appreciate, to insist that the special commissioners in Campania do not hark back to the past, but once and for all look to the future."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am an elected member of a political group which, when it was in government in Italy, before the current government, had to deploy the police force before it could start building normal waste disposal units in Campania, urgent works, which were at that time obstructed by opponents, Mrs Frassoni, who are now ministers in the government of Romano Prodi."
"Mr Prodi's recent statements on the waste crisis in Campania bear witness to the total collapse of the government which he leads."
"Naples offers proof of a State which does not guarantee the law and tolerates a situation which is hazardous for the health of citizens, damaging for tourism and for Italy's image and therefore for the Italian economy and Italian exports."
"The severe problems being faced by the people of Campania are nevertheless limited to only one of Italy's twenty regions, and political and administrative responsibility can be readily attributed to certain administrators, and we therefore call for their resignation."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I should like to clarify that the responsibility for implementing Community law correctly lies primarily with the Member States."
"The Commission has no powers under the Treaty to substitute Member States' authorities in their planning activities and in their decisions, for example on whether or not to construct waste-disposal installations and where those installations will be."
"The role of the Commission is that of monitoring the application of Community law."
"Where this is not satisfactory, as in the current case, the Commission can launch infringement procedures, but the solutions must always be found and put in place by the Member States."
"We are concerned that the waste situation in Campania is worsening, despite the actions taken by the Italian authorities in 2007."
"It is essential that the Italian authorities, besides taking immediate measures to tackle the current crisis, intensify their efforts for putting in place a structure enabling the Campania region to ensure long-term sustainable waste management that is fully in line with European waste legislation."
"I am convinced that, this time, crisis management must lead to a real turnaround in waste management policy in order to avoid further risks to human health and the environment."
"Therefore, any action to be taken for the future will have to lead to an effectively implemented strategy focusing not only on establishing a sufficient network of waste-treatment facilities."
"It is of equal importance to provide the necessary structures for separate waste collection, recycling and the avoidance of waste, fully respecting the waste hierarchy within which the dumping of waste remains the least-desired option."
"Any new waste-management plan in that sense must not remain on paper, as we have seen in the past, but needs to be strictly implemented."
"The present waste disaster could be taken as an opportunity to demonstrate Italy's capacity of turning the Campania region into a best practice example of proper waste management, and other Italian regions, such as the area of Milan, have shown that this is possible."
"The Commission, as the guardian of the Treaty, will continue the infringement procedure against Italy - started in June 2007 - for a breach of Community waste legislation."
"It is ready to take further legal steps, should the current breaches of Community legislation continue, using all available measures under the Treaty, including the possibility of imposing fines under Article 220 of the Treaty."
"Apart from this, however, my services are ready to assist Italy in any manner deemed necessary and helpful for finding and implementing a long-term sustainable solution to the current waste-management problem."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0001/2008)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Part one"
"Madam President, could you offer the House a little guidance, in view of the time, so that those of us who have tabled questions know exactly what the procedure will be?"
"Will you be dividing the items up equally into three parts, or into two half-hour parts?"
"I ask because those of us involved in a potential third part need to know what is likely to happen, given the time at which we are starting."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the main purpose of the Community's legal provisions and political strategies in the pharmaceutical field is to ensure that patients are supplied with safe, effective, high-quality medicines that are affordable and universally available."
"On more than one occasion in the past, the question of the safety of medicines marketed through what is known as pharmaceutical parallel trade has been raised."
"That has prompted me to commission a study in order to get to the bottom of this issue; the study is to examine all aspects of sales channels and, in particular, questions relating to counterfeit medicines and parallel trade."
"The aim of the study is to analyse the present situation and to develop political options with a view to plugging gaps, if necessary by amending the current legal provisions."
"The study will also examine potential links between pharmaceutical parallel trade and the appearance of counterfeit medicines."
"Regrettably, I must tell you that the first part of the study, devoted to parallel trade, which has now been completed, shows that such trade poses considerable risks to patient safety."
"Several factors are to blame, including mistakes in repackaging or relabelling, the limited effect of product recalls, the more complex distribution channels, supply interruptions and, finally, shortcomings in the enforcement of applicable legal provisions."
"The Commission is currently analysing the findings of the study with a view to developing a coherent strategy for the elimination of these safety risks."
"The various political options are being examined for their foreseeable social, economic and environmental impact."
"Given the significant implications of this issue for public health policy, the Commission gives it high priority."
"Decisions on where we go from here will be taken shortly."
"I should also like to inform you that the European Pharmaceutical Forum offers a platform for easier adoption and sharing of good practices with regard to the pricing of medicines and reimbursement of the cost of medicines."
"Although these matters fall within the purview of the Member States, the relevant measures still have to be consistent with Community law."
"The work of the Pharmaceutical Forum, in which patient organisations, members of the medical profession and leading figures in the industry as well as the Ministers of Health of all the Member States are represented, can help to resolve the major issue of affordable access to safe medicines."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your response, which is clear but alarming, because obviously there are problems about safety."
"I would like you to outline the timeframe which will apply to your response, because I think people are not generally aware how at risk they might be from counterfeit medicines."
"And could I ask you - in writing, perhaps - to address an issue which is of concern in Ireland in relation to vaccines which were legitimate vaccines but which damaged children and for which people are still waiting for some form of compensation after 40 years?"
"Perhaps you could write to me stating how other Member States are handling that contentious issue."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) I shall gladly do so."
"In answer to your first question, let me say that I have already decided that parallel trade in counterfeit medicines will be treated as a matter of priority."
"I have amended the workplan of the Directorate-General, and we shall be making legislative proposals during the current year."
"I believe that can be done shortly after the summer recess."
"As for your other question, I am grateful for your recognition that I cannot answer it without prior examination."
"I shall have that examination carried out, and you will receive the requested written answer in the coming days."
"- (LT) I would like to ask about prices."
"In Germany, nasal drops cost 1.5-2 times less than the same medicine costs in Lithuania."
"We take care to ensure that all countries, even the developing ones, have access to medicine."
"Could we take care to ensure that our citizens, EU citizens, pay at least a similar price for the same medicine?"
"Could we do anything here in Europe?"
"(ES) Madam President, health services form a recurring topic in European Parliament debates."
"Each time we discuss the Services Directive there is a bid to include them in it, a bid which we have hitherto opposed, and health services have remained outside its scope."
"The supply of medication is a health service."
"There are some States, such as the Spanish State, which have an established group of sites - pharmacies - which are the only places where medicines may be dispensed."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner whether, as part of the investigation carried out by the Commission, any differences have been noted between States where pharmacies are a restricted, monitored trade and the others, with regard to the counterfeiting of medicines and inferior quality."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, the Commission has to date been managing the problem of carbon dioxide emissions due to its activities, through the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, better known as EMAS, and has been complying with the rules of that scheme."
"Since 2005, the Commission has been enforcing EMAS in five of the departments in Brussels and in eight of its buildings."
"During this time, it has recorded a clear reduction in the growth rate in consumption of, amongst other things, electricity by those departments, a development which is undoubtedly positive."
"Overall CO2 emission reduction targets have not yet been set for the Commission, but within the framework of EMAS, the Commission is examining and analysing the total volume of its CO2 emissions, and will set overall emission reduction targets within the year 2008."
"In particular, as regards its vehicle fleet, the Commission has already set a target of reducing CO2 emissions by an average of 26% between 2006 and 2012."
"The Commission will be making some major announcements on Wednesday, and I expect that people everywhere will be asking then whether we practise what we preach."
"So to hear that only five DGs have currently signed up to EMAS is not very encouraging, although I cannot say that Parliament can claim to be much better. It would certainly fail such a test, although action is now being taken to address the issue."
"Does the Commissioner accept that his arguments in favour of the 'big picture changes' that must be made by Member States if we are to tackle climate change could be undermined if the Commission is not seen to be acting on the fine detail - on its own implementation of these improvements?"
"Member of the Commission. - Yes, I agree with you."
"We should practise what we preach, and this is what we are going to do in 2008."
"I expect the Commission and its services will target a reduction in emissions to at least the same level as we are requesting of the Member States."
"As you know, we have set a 30% reduction target, provided that other developed countries follow, or a 20% target if they do not sign up to an international agreement on reducing emissions."
"We will set ourselves the 30% target, and I expect that, in so doing, we will show by example that we mean what we are asking others to do."
"By the way, we will have to conduct a study to determine the exact quantity of emissions from the Commission, before setting targets and a timetable, and also establishing an action plan to combat emissions."
"(DE) There is something I would be interested to know."
"We have this 30% reduction target imposed from the top down, and it does seem to be widely endorsed."
"As you quite rightly said, others must follow suit if these targets are to be achieved."
"My own question to you is this: do you yourself have a plan for achieving this 30% reduction personally in your own sphere of activity?"
"(DE) As we know, the European Parliament has set a reduction target of 30% by 2012 on the basis of EMAS, and we are keen to see what specific measures are adopted by the European Parliament and its decision-makers."
"Commissioner, you said that the application of EMAS would mean less electricity consumption."
"It would interest me to know what specific measures have been taken, what specific measures are planned for the coming years, and what role renewables are to play."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission is concerned about privacy and security problems in the information society, in particular when these put consumers at risk."
"The use of spam, spyware and malicious software is in clear breach of the European privacy legislation, and in some cases it is even a criminal offence."
"This is why we need vigorous enforcement by competent authorities."
"Last December, Commissioner Reding (whom I have the pleasure to replace here) welcomed the fast and effective intervention by the Dutch regulator, which imposed a fine totalling EUR 1 million on three Dutch enterprises for illegally installing 'spyware' and 'adware' on more than 22 million computers in the Netherlands and elsewhere."
"She has called upon other regulators to follow this example."
"On 13 November 2007 the Commission adopted its proposals on the Telecom Reform, which include provisions that further strengthen the security and privacy regime underpinning the information society."
"In relation to spam, the proposals introduced the possibility for internet service providers to take legal action against spammers."
"This provision is expected to become an important tool in the fight against spam in Europe."
"Also, the effectiveness of anti-spam enforcement will be strengthened by including this in the scope of the Regulation on Consumer Protection Cooperation, which provides for a network of public enforcement authorities throughout the Community and a minimum level of investigation and enforcement powers to apply this regulation effectively."
"More generally, the proposals include the provision for customers of electronic communication services to be informed of possible actions that a service provider may take to address security threats, or in response to a security or integrity incident."
"By introducing the concept of breach notifications, users of electronic communication services would be told about breaches of security when this has resulted in personal data being lost or compromised, and about precautions that they may take in order to minimise the economic loss or social harm that could result from a security breach."
"To ensure compliance with these requirements, national regulatory authorities will be given the power to issue binding instructions to operators on the measures that are required to secure electronic communication networks and services and to oversee proper implementation."
"The proposed European Electronic Communications Market Authority will have as one of its core tasks network and information security and will assist the Commission in implementing measures on a European level where appropriate."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for that comprehensive answer."
"I do not know what the digital equivalent of 'epidemic' is, but following this Christmas season we now see an epidemic of this kind of behaviour. All the independent organisations have said that."
"I do not want to belittle anything the Commission has done;"
"I think it has made this a priority."
"What I would ask, though, is that examples like the Dutch example of encouraging prosecutions, encouraging ISPs to be free to go after these people - none of this, I feel, is coming back to consumers."
"Is there something simple that the Commission can issue for MEPs, to tell our consumers what you are doing and how effectively this is being measured?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I could not agree more."
"I have already said that proposals are in place and are currently under consideration by Parliament and the Council."
"I expect these to enter into force, and we will then have all the necessary requirements in place."
"The current legal situation allows action to be taken against such violations, although this depends on the case."
"In the case of a criminal offence, people can ask for the support of the police, or can take other legal action."
"As I have already mentioned, the example set by the Dutch regulator OPTA has been welcomed by the Commission in a press release."
"I have the full text here."
"If you wish, I can hand it to you after Question Time so you can read what we have already done."
"(EL) Madam President, the Commissioner Mr Reding is absent, of course, but I am sure the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Verheugen, has sufficient breadth of knowledge to answer my question on a supplementary matter: whether the Commission has evidence or clues linking the source of unsolicited e-mails - spam - to the companies offering services and products for protection against such unwanted intrusions."
"I would like to connect the first question by Ms McGuinness on protecting consumers from counterfeit and sub-standard medicines with the question by Mr Moraes on protecting consumers against spam."
"One of the huge problems I, like most others, have is the amount of medicines advertised in spam, along with all sorts of products that enhance all sorts of bits of the body which some of us do not even possess!"
"I wonder, with reference to the parallel market study you referred to, if there are any studies under way on the whole issue of the internet, spam and counterfeit medicines, and in particular on sub-standard medicines that offer no guarantee of safety or efficacy for consumers and patients everywhere."
"There is horrific growth in that particular area."
"Member of the Commission. - The first results of the product safety stocktaking were released on 22 November 2007."
"These indicate that the regulatory framework is fit for the purpose, if properly applied and when properly applied."
"The Rapex system is working efficiently to ensure that dangerous products are recalled from the market throughout the European Union."
"The stocktaking report nonetheless identifies scope for improvements, both in preventive actions and in international cooperation, such as enhanced enforcement."
"Some envisaged improvements are already at an advanced stage towards becoming concrete actions, notably as concerns the revision of the Toy Safety Directive."
"The Commission is also in the process of preparing a temporary measure requiring warnings on magnetic toys, pending revision of the standards, to address the risk those toys could pose."
"The Commission is assisting the Member States' market surveillance authorities to identify and share best practices with a view to improved controls."
"In October 2007, Member States reported on initiatives for better cooperation with economic operators and on specific surveillance campaigns on toys."
"The Commission intends to publish comparative enforcement capacity data in the consumer scoreboard for 2008, in what is a new and, I hope, very helpful initiative."
"The Commission also continues to concretely reinforce the market surveillance capacity of the Member States by participating in the financing of well-designed joint market surveillance projects."
"Those projects received EUR 1.3 million in Community funding in 2007."
"In addition to actions to improve protection within the EU, various actions are under way to strengthen protection at borders."
"Recent major changes to EU customs legislation will assist in identifying high risk consignments for controls."
"Secure customs exchange mechanisms will also enable rapid action to be taken when information becomes available on new types of dangerous products."
"Information available in the Rapex system will be distributed using this mechanism, in order to alert the competent customs authorities of specific, potentially dangerous cargos."
"The Commission also agrees that traceability is an issue for further improvements."
"Statistics show that products of unknown origin notified through Rapex were, for the first time, down to 3% in October 2007, as compared to 17% in 2006."
"The Commission is currently analysing, with the help of the Member States, how to ensure that this improvement is not only temporary, and how to make it sustainable."
"The Commission has already included, in the legislation under the internal market for goods package, a provision requiring economic operators to have available the identity of their supplier."
"This should be helpful for market surveillance intervention once that legislation enters into force."
"The Commission has also asked what China could do about traceability, and welcomes the initiatives taken in China to require bar coding, at factory level, of certain categories of high risk products."
"Finally, the Commission has highlighted the responsibility of the economic operators concerned, and welcomes the commitment from industry to work on measures to build consumer confidence, in particular through what we are calling a 'safety pact'."
"The Commission will also send experts to carry out a study of business safety measures in the supply chain, and will report further on this in the first quarter of 2008."
"(FR) Thank you for your response, Commissioner: I am glad that the Commission intends to take a series of measures to reduce, in so far as possible, the risks associated with the circulation of imported toys, particularly those from China."
"One important aspect here, which the Commission has highlighted, is the traceability of toys from producer to consumer - and you did refer briefly to that in your reply."
"A major question remains unanswered, however."
"In the event of hundreds of thousands of toys being withdrawn from the market, as happened last year, can you tell me please, Commissioner, what becomes of those toys?"
"What proof do you have that they are removed absolutely from the market?"
"I have heard reports - which prompted me to ask my question today - that they are being put back onto the market, for sale to other children."
"All children, throughout the world, are entitled to benefit from the same approach on our part: I think none of us will argue with that."
"Does the traceability system enable you to follow these toys all the way to their destruction?"
"Member of the Commission. - I think that your question is absolutely valid and very humane."
"We have to pursue our goal: these dangerous toys must not reach not just the European market, which is our duty, but any market, and we have some well-developed tools to help us."
"We can conduct a market surveillance, we have controls and our Rapex system, which is a system through which we can get information through the market and not only when the dangerous goods are stopped at our borders."
"However, what is also important for us as a global leader in the safety process is not to allow these dangerous goods - especially toys - to reach other children - in China as well."
"It is not enough just to preach for the safety of European kids, which is part of our duty."
"I have asked the main producers several times openly and clearly to destroy the toys and I have also invited them to the Commission in Brussels, where we discussed how to ensure that the toys are destroyed."
"They all committed to this."
"In particular, I urged Mattel, as the major industry with more recalls than any other, to comply, and it has agreed to this obligation."
"It is not legally binding: I cannot make them destroy their factories."
"But I think we are facing a time when the legislative framework is just a framework and there are things that are beyond and outside the framework."
"We need to vigorously pursue measures that are above the absolutely necessary from a legislative point of view."
"I had an opportunity to discuss this issue with UNICEF and the Americans during the TACD dialogue."
"I am fully aware of your concerns and, believe me, I will not spare efforts to make it public and to pursue the goal of destroying these toys."
"Nevertheless, I do not have a legislative base outside Europe."
"(DE) Commissioner, you have indicated that a great deal is being done to remove dangerous toys from the market."
"That is an important step."
"The fact is, however, that some of these products are being marketed here with generally recognised certification marks, including in some cases the familiar CE mark."
"Under any rules of good practice, if a toy is not demonstrably safe or is actually dangerous, such labelling is not only abusive but downright fraudulent."
"Is there scope to envisage criminal prosecution in such cases?"
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your detailed response."
"In relation to Ireland, one item purchased there over the Christmas period actually exploded, and the name of the manufacturer was not identifiable."
"Is it possible to have legislation introduced in all countries to make it illegal to sell an item on which the manufacturer is not clearly identifiable?"
"I think that is the way forward, and I would ask if that could be done."
"Member of the Commission. - I know that this question is very important, and I would like to assure you that the Commission does not monitor shops during periods of higher consumption, nor does it collaborate with the national consumer organisations on this specific question."
"So we very much rely on national efforts."
"However, the Commission does intend to improve its tools for monitoring the functioning of the internal market from a consumer perspective."
"The single market review set out the Commission's plans for a consumer scoreboard and for more detailed price monitoring, but I would like especially to stress that this is about monitoring."
"Published Eurostat data show that prices of milk, cheese and eggs in Greece are 38% higher than the average prices of the same group for the European Union."
"The average prices for this product group over the period 1996-2007 grew by almost 52% in Greece and only by 24% in the EU."
"However, this development appears to be structural rather than seasonal."
"Since 2005 the prices of dairy products for Greece do not appear to reveal seasonal fluctuations."
"(EL) Madam President, I would like to say thank you very much to the Commissioner, and thank you very much for the information."
"I shall also consult Eurostat so that we can see the whole scoreboard, because it is significant, of course, and important for my country - which you have mentioned - but I believe there are similar situations in other countries and it would therefore be interesting to see how your Commission is going to handle this issue generally."
"Either with a recommendation or with a Directive which will cover all products and not only consumables."
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission is undertaking measures at different levels aimed at reducing increases in food prices."
"One initiative is to begin monitoring prices, which I mentioned earlier."
"This is one of the objectives of the consumer market scoreboard on which we are working and which I believe will be supported by the Commission pretty soon."
"The Commission has also proposed a number of measures within the framework of agricultural policy. A reduction of obligatory set-aside land, already in force for the 2008 crop season; an increase in milk quotas for the year 2008-2009 adopted by the Commission and proposed to the Council, if adopted, will be in force from 1 April 2008 onwards, and a reduction of import duties in the cereals sector to reduce increases in cereal prices and also in the future of the price of meat."
"This measure came into force from the beginning of January 2008."
"This is a kind of inventory of what we have done."
"But, through the consumer market scoreboard, one of the main topics of our investigations will be prices and part of this basket will be about food prices."
"So we will duly inform you; we will consult as to what the next step will be after the data monitoring and we can take action to see what is behind this - of course, hand in hand with the national authorities."
"It is interesting that when food prices are rising, the Commission will act to look at it and I would urge the Commission to come up with statistics that show us the share-out of the final retail price between producer - and I mean farmers - and consumer, because that information is not available."
"I think that it is also fair to say, on the record, that the era of relatively low food prices is over and that I think that the Commission should not fool people by saying that we are going to go back to lower food prices."
"Perhaps what we need to do is to educate people about buying quality food at a fair price."
"- (LT) Last summer, prices started rising in all EU Member States."
"We then raised the question of whether there were any cartel agreements."
"In my country, Lithuania, it was found that milk processing companies agreed on raising prices."
"Now the meat sector is being scrutinised."
"Are such studies carried out in other EU countries?"
"Now a new term has appeared - 'the end of cheap food'."
"Don't representatives of the food industry use this new term, and how can consumers protect themselves?"
"Member of the Commission. - The price of food fluctuates because of the seasonal character of agricultural production."
"Those fluctuations are not completely passed on to consumers because the cost of raw materials has, until recently, been decreasing and because of warehousing technologies catering for those seasonal shortages."
"Recently, more systematic food price increases seem to be taking place, and the principal reason seems to be growing demand from emerging large economies, like China and India."
"We have already discussed the fact that in India last year there were five million more people with a new diet that is based much more on milk, milk products and meat."
"Last summer the situation worsened owing to adverse climatic conditions in many producing regions, and this has been the main reason for the exceptionally high increase in food prices in the European Union since September 2007."
"The Commission and the national competition authorities are carefully monitoring the market."
"Anti-competitive practices have been discovered in the dairy sector in the United Kingdom and in Greece, and fines have been imposed on firms involved in those anti-competitive practices."
"I feel that, if the Latvian national authorities have been informed, then they will be working on the case you mention, especially as it is high on the public agenda."
"What we really need is a sectoral investigation to see whether there is any kind of cartel behind it, which has already happened in two EU countries."
"Member of the Commission. - I would like to thank the Honourable Member for her interest in the single market review."
"Alongside our Communication on the single market for 21st century Europe, we adopted a package of measures to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of retail financial services markets."
"Integral to that package are initiatives to improve consumer confidence and empower them to seek out the best product for their individual needs."
"Although the Commission focus on empowering consumers is not recent, current financial turbulence certainly highlights the importance of this matter."
"I would like to address all three areas mentioned by the Honourable Member: education, inclusion and redress."
"Financial education is best delivered as close as possible to the citizens that need it, namely at the level of national and regional authorities, non-governmental agencies and the financial services sector."
"At the end of 2007, we adopted a communication on financial education to raise awareness of the need to increase consumers' level of financial literacy, promote the provision of high-quality financial education in the European Union and provide some practical tools to help achieve these goals."
"It includes some principles to guide financial services providers and announces some practical initiatives."
"These range from publishing an on-line database of financial education provision and research in the EU, to an enhancement of the existing Dolceta on-line educational tool to help teachers incorporate financial matters into the school curriculum."
"Today, having a bank account is a prerequisite for being able to fully participate in social and economic life, and all EU citizens should have access to a basic bank account."
"We are currently carrying out a study to identify and analyse policy measures taken by Member States to prevent financial exclusion."
"Based on this information, which we hope to receive at the end of this month, we will reflect on how best to ensure that all EU citizens have access to a basic bank account."
"Finally, when buying financial services, consumers need to know that in the event of a problem they can have easy access to redress."
"While out-of-court dispute settlement bodies exist in many EU countries, not all of these are members of the Commission-run FIN-NET, the aim of which is to facilitate consumer access to redress in cross-border cases."
"With this in mind, we are working to ensure that all existing out-of-court dispute resolution bodies are part of FIN-NET."
"We are also reflecting more generally on how to encourage the creation of alternative redress systems where these do not already exist."
"Those initiatives will not create confidence and empower consumers overnight, but they are a complement to the initiatives we are taking in other related areas, such as information and advice."
"(DE) I appreciate that Mr McCreevy has a tight schedule, but others have pressing engagements too."
"I merely wanted to ask whether or not my question to Mrs Kuneva will still be heard, in other words whether I can go to my Group meeting now or whether I should wait here."
"It is unlikely that we will get to your question."
"It is regrettable that we are in the situation we are in."
"Your question will almost certainly be answered in writing."
"Commissioner, I want to ask you a little bit more about financial education, which is the new buzzword."
"I think you will agree that there is a real imbalance in power between financial institutions and consumers, not least because, firstly, consumers need access to credit, and, secondly, regardless of the level of financial education, how many people are going to read the 25-page document that accompanies, for example, their insurance policy, and refer to it every year?"
"You said that this issue needs to be addressed at local and regional level, but would you not agree there needs to be greater cooperation between the major stakeholders, such as financial regulators, governments, consumer organisations and financial complaints bodies so that, working together, they can highlight some of the problems and issues, and at least act as an early warning system for the consumer?"
"Member of the Commission. - What we have been attempting to do here in financial education is to get this on the agenda and to make everybody aware, particularly in Member States, that it would probably be a better investment than in lots of other areas if, from a very early stage in the school curriculum, some basic financial literacy was taught."
"Because, going through life, whether one ends up as the chief financial controller of a major institution or whether one has a very ordinary job in one's local area, you are definitely going to encounter - at some stage you are going to have to deal with - some major financial transaction such as the buying of a car, a house, a washing machine or whatever."
"I think that from an early stage it would be far better if people had a little bit taught to them in the school curriculum programme so that they would know some basic information."
"What Ms Harkin was speaking about goes on to a higher level as to what type of information should be given to a consumer, because she is correct: the amount of information that is given to them and the 48 pages that they get to read in very small writing is there for the sole purpose, in my view (and it has always been my view), of satisfying lawyers, so that if there is a case, they can charge bigger and bigger fees for telling you that you have either won or lost."
"I have absolutely no faith in that at all."
"Some of that particular area is directly under my own responsibility."
"I often recall a particular case when I was in Scotland about two years or so ago, meeting with some of the financial educators who were talking about the Perspectives Directive in the UCITS area."
"They said there were 81 pages in the Perspectives Directive and 78 pages in the simplified perspectives to do with a particular product."
"So, in the Consumer Credit Directive, which I think is being dealt with at present in Parliament, Ms Kuneva will make some improvements as to what type of basic information consumers should be given."
"Ms Kuneva is dealing with those particular aspects."
"But in the whole area of financial education, the place where I have been trying to up the agenda is for Member States to include, from an early stage, some basic financial education as part of the core curriculum programme."
"I think everybody would be far better off doing it like that than having pages and pages of small type that no one ever reads."
"(DE) Commissioner, I am sure you are right when you call for a start to be made at the level of school education in order to put consumers in a better position (a) to know their rights and (b) to exercise them."
"The problem, however, is that we still have a generation, indeed more than one generation, of people who think differently, who have heard that financial services and the financial market are subject to particularly stringent government supervision and who act on that knowledge, believing they can rely on such government supervision."
"In actual fact, much has changed in recent times as a result of market deregulation."
"Are there not perhaps one or two things that can yet be done in the realm of state supervision?"
"Madam President, could I suggest to the Commissioner that, not only does the information satisfy lawyers, but it bamboozles consumers?"
"And that is why it is there."
"Like a lot of information, it is like the instructions for the washing machine. We read it when it breaks down and it is too late."
"Could I suggest you look at the role of credit unions in educating consumers, because I think that is an issue in Ireland in particular?"
"And, can I gently remind you, as you mentioned redress, of the absolute lack of redress for Equitable Life policyholders."
"I am sure that Ms Wallis will support me on this and perhaps in a quiet moment you might come back to us with a written response as to what has happened since our report was voted on and supported by you."
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission does not keep consolidated records of the number of European investment firms or the number of investment firms in Greece."
"However, Member States are required by MiFID to keep a record of all investment firms registered within their territory."
"The Hellenic Capital Market Commission should therefore be able to supply the data for Greek companies."
"With MiFID, the trading monopolies for exchanges have been abolished, investment firms have better access to providing their services across the European Economic Area using the MiFID passport and consumer protection has been strengthened."
"This leads to increased competition across borders and between trading venues, which will in turn increase liquidity and the depth of the financial markets, for the benefit of both the industry and consumers."
"Our expectation that cost of capital would decline is based on a rigorous study carried out by London Economics in 2002."
"This study modelled the impact of financial integration, of which MiFID is the cornerstone, in terms of its impact on the then EU-15."
"The main conclusions from the study were that financial integration would lead to a reduction in the cost of equity capital of an average of 50 basis points across the Member States, and a reduction in the cost of market debt for non-financial issuers of 40 basis points."
"The study estimated that the combined effects of financial market integration to the EU economy would result in the following: an increase of EU-wide real GDP of 1.1% in the long run; an increase of 6% of the total business investment; an increase in private consumption of 0.8%; and an increase of 0.5% in total employment."
"Figures compiled informally by the Committee of European Securities Regulators in the run-up to the implementation of MiFID suggest that only very limited numbers of firms were at that time making use of the passport for investment services under the then Investment Services Directive into or out of Greece."
"We expect this to change in the future as Greek markets open up as a result of MiFID, and as Greek firms see more opportunities in other Member States."
"The Federation of European Securities Exchanges keeps statistics on foreign equity trading, as well as on the percentage of shares owned by investors."
"As of December 2005, 41% of the shares traded on the Athens exchange were held by foreign investors."
"In November 2007, the foreign equity trading turnover on the Athens exchange was EUR 970 million."
"(EL) Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for his answer, and I would like to ask in addition whether the Commission has data on the volume of credit intermediation in the European Union, and specifically what percentage of the European GDP this credit intermediation represents."
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission sent a letter of formal notice to the Irish authorities following a complaint on 29 June 2007."
"This letter requested information on restrictive conditions set out in a number of Irish county development plans."
"The Commission raised questions regarding the compatibility of certain requirements to obtain building permission with two principles of the Treaty, namely the freedom of establishment and the free movement of capital."
"Indirectly, such restrictions could also affect the free movement of workers, but this issue was not raised."
"Following an agreed extension of one month to respond, the Irish authorities sent their response at the end of September."
"My services have been examining its content and are planning to contact the Irish authorities in order to hold a meeting at a technical level to further clarify and discuss the position of the Irish authorities."
"Following these discussions, the Commission will be in a position to assess whether or not there are grounds to pursue this infringement procedure."
"The response from the Irish Government was lodged on 28 September 2007."
"I understand that the response has not been made public."
"This is a very important issue which affects 22 local authorities in Ireland."
"I am just wondering if the response can be released at this stage now that it is before the Commission and it has had time to consider it?"
"Maybe the Commissioner might outline the timescale when a decision will be made by the Commission on this matter."
"Member of the Commission. - It is not our practice to make responses available to the public, but then again those responses often end up in the public domain."
"I can confirm that we received a response on 28 September 2007, as the Honourable Member has stated."
"As I said in my reply, we intend to have a meeting with the Irish authorities about this matter."
"We will see how we proceed from there."
"I should point out, also, that Ireland is not the only Member State where there are difficulties like this."
"My services are hoping to meet the Irish authorities in the very near future, and we will then have to consider what they say and take further steps, if these are required."
"I should just like to ask the Commissioner - with regard to the rule of subsidiarity, and in particular the issue of planning permission - is this an area that the Commission should be involved in, when the operation of planning and the right to build a property is separate from the right to own property and exploit that property?"
"Member of the Commission. - On 17 November, the Commission sent a reasoned opinion requesting that Ireland abolish the exemption in place for the Irish Voluntary Health Insurance (VHI) from certain EU rules."
"These rules, notably the first non-life insurance directive of 1973, as subsequently amended, aim at harmonising certain requirements for the commencement and conduct of direct non-life insurance business, and therefore also pertain to private health insurance."
"The first non-life insurance directive exempted the VHI, among other institutions, from its rules."
"However, this exemption is applicable only as long as the capacity of the exempted institution is not in any way amended by a change of its statutes or by any change in the relevant national law."
"Accordingly, upon extension or change of capacity, the institution becomes subject to the full set of rules of Community law which otherwise apply to non-life insurance."
"These rules, for example, require insurance undertakings to seek official authorisation before taking up their business; to adopt a certain legal form; and to establish adequate protective provisions which have to be sufficiently matched by the undertaking's assets in order to retain an adequate solvency margin."
"One of the main objectives of these provisions is to protect the rights of those who have subscribed to an insurance policy, thereby making sure that the exercise of freedom to provide services is not to the detriment of consumer protection."
"In addition, these rules guarantee a level playing field between insurers."
"Given its initial exemption from the first directive, and as long as its capacity remained unchanged, the VHI did not have to comply with these rules."
"The Commission, however, takes the view that the VHI's capacity has indeed changed."
"Several amendments to the relevant Irish law in 1996, 1998 and 2001 extended the VHI's scope of business far beyond what it was when the VHI's exemption was first granted."
"Therefore, VHI's initial exemption from the EU's rules for insurers is no longer applicable."
"The Commission expressed this view in the reasoned opinion that was sent to Ireland on 14 November."
"It has asked Ireland to take, within two months, the necessary steps to subject the VHI to those supervisory and prudential rules of Community law for which it formerly enjoyed the exemption."
"The Commission considers that this reasoned opinion is a decisive step towards putting all competitors in the Irish private health insurance market on an equal footing under European insurance legislation."
"This serves the interests of policyholders as well as of fair competition."
"The Commission will closely monitor the steps taken by the Irish Government and will, failing appropriate action, pursue legal proceedings before the European Court of Justice."
"Madam President, may I thank the Commissioner for taking the question."
"Could I ask him if he has any indication of the timescale involved in obtaining a reply from the Irish Government in relation to the VHI in particular?"
"Could I ask him whether this will have any implications for equalisation?"
"The VHI continues to dominate 75% of the market in Ireland, but they claim that they need risk equalisation to protect them from being left holding all the older, and therefore higher-liability, clients."
"Will the issue raised by the Commissioner have any implications for equalisation?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission uses all the instruments available to ensure the effective enforcement of consumer rights across Europe."
"A new consumer-enforcement network was established at the end of 2006 in the regulation on consumer protection cooperation."
"It provides a framework for joint market surveillance and enforcement exercises, such as the sweep on air ticket sales sites, carried out in September 2007."
"That was the first ever exercise of its type."
"The Commission coordinated this exercise, and provided the results of the first phase of the investigation in November 2007."
"At this stage, the disclosure of the names of the sites on which certain irregularities were detected, as suggested by the honourable Member, would be premature and would not respect the legal framework in certain Member States."
"I quite understand your impatience, because we would all like to get things done, and in the right way."
"However, the right of reply, which means the right to defend oneself, is recognised across the EU Member States."
"It is the competence of the national authorities and courts to apply that right, and we are awaiting the outcome of court decisions in some countries."
"The Commission will, therefore, present the outcome of the investigations and enforcement actions presently ongoing in the Member States once those proceedings have been completed."
"I have held talks with the authorities on the basis of the consumer enforcement network, and they are committed to going further and to providing this data, but court procedures - in at least two countries - prevent us from having a full picture and from announcing it publicly."
"I think last July we all applauded the Degutis report when at last we said we were going to have transparency in relation to charging, that all taxes and fees levied would be upfront in all advertisements."
"And then we read, in The European Voice on 31 October: 'Air ticket sites faced EU shame: Commission threatens to reveal the names of the hundreds of websites which allegedly mislead consumers'."
"I am at a loss to know why these big commercial operations are not named, why they are not shamed."
"They continue to flout the rules and regulations and the undertaking."
"They continue to mislead the consumer."
"Last week, for example, Ryanair - give them credit for what they have done - published this in all Irish newspapers: 'Buy one flight, get a second absolutely free."
"Pay no fees, taxes, levies or charges'. So I booked my flight, and it cost me EUR 153."
"And then the one that was supposed to be free is as follows: credit card fee: EUR 12; taxes, fees and charges: EUR 39.96; insurance: EUR 14."
"Total price: free flight EUR 67."
"What more evidence do you want?"
"Member of the Commission. - Cases like this one were the main reason to step up and to have this enforcement action."
"But I must reiterate: in many Member States it is only possible to publish the names of the airlines after the investigations and enforcement actions are finished."
"Since cases differ, the time needed to deal with them can take longer in some cases than in others."
"Currently the Commission is discussing with Member States how much time is needed to finish these actions and the Commission will publish - I already have this commitment - these names as soon as it is legally possible, otherwise the Commission could be sued."
"If Member States can close the cases as originally foreseen, the names can be published in the coming months."
"Initially I thought that we would be able to do it in February, but after more detailed discussions, comparing the legal system and how much time it takes from the legal point of view, I believe there may be a delay of one and a half months."
"But I think that you are absolutely right and, if you allow me, I will use your case as one more reason for the need to step up."
"We have, since the beginning of this year, unfair commercial practices and while trying not to go too much into cases, I think this is a good example of a breach of the unfair commercial practices legislation as well."
"(EL) Madam President, Madam Commissioner, I was one of the first, if not the first, to ask this question before the November issue came up, and before the announcement."
"In your answer, you told me that within reasonable time, about two months, we would have the names or the results of your research."
"Afterwards, in an interview you gave, I saw that you said four months."
"Also, when the name of Ryan was announced, or rather appeared in the newspapers - as our colleague Mr Higgins has quite rightly said - as one of the companies, and according to your research there are 433 airlines and tourist agencies which have this kind of low-priced ticket, finally Ryan said it was not the only one."
"Some other large, well-known companies used their name, which I would not like to use in Parliament, and you closed your eyes to this issue."
"I therefore think it is advisable that you should give the names soon, so that public opinion, and competition among companies, large or small, can be allowed to cool down."
"Member of the Commission. - I will not deny that I have drawn inspiration from Parliament and its Members many times, so I am glad that in this case it is regarding the specific investigation on air tickets."
"We actually picked air tickets for our first sweep quite deliberately."
"I do not want to sound defensive."
"I am doing what I am required by law."
"I have taken the advice of the Commission's Legal Services and can go further before the Court procedures are over in certain Member States."
"If the procedure in one Member State takes four months, I cannot do anything."
"Acting before that procedure is concluded would be in breach of national legislation, and would endanger the reputation of the Commission."
"That is why I am waiting until these procedures are completed before the names are published."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"I should like to thank Commissioner Kuneva for waiting."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Madam President, I apologise to you, and to the interpreters for delaying them further."
"I just wish to place on the record my objection to the way that Question Time again has been messed around."
"Those of us who use it as a political tool to try and get answers from the institutions are left without any words as regards how badly we are treated as Members of this House."
"I will be raising this matter at the Conference of Presidents, but I hope that the Bureau will take it on board as well and try and make sure the working of the Chamber on a day-to-day basis does not encroach every single time on our Question Time."
"Thank you, Mr Crowley."
"I think you will be aware that today has been a difficult day for one reason and another."
"We have had almost an hour and a half, and we have done our best to accommodate everybody's wishes."
"As you will know, we are also hoping to improve matters with the reform working group, but thank you for your comments, and thank you to our interpreters."
"(The sitting was suspended at 19.45 and resumed at 21.00)"
"Adult learning: It is never too late to learn (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Doris Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on adult learning: it is never too late to learn."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the title of the Commission's communication and action plan on adult learning, 'It is never too late to learn', and its German title, Man lernt nie aus ('You live and learn'), are both universally familiar sayings, but when you read between the lines in the present context, they actually imply an acknowledgement of past omissions in the field of European education policy."
"None the less, we are pleased that the Commission, with this communication and this action plan, is entering an age marked by growing awareness of the need for lifelong learning, an age in which new demographic challenges must be faced."
"Economic and social changes in the EU require significant adjustments to vocational skills and qualifications."
"The challenges of the labour market must be met, by which I mean that the employability of individuals must be one of the foremost aims of adult education."
"Education, however, and especially adult education, is also a factor in people's personal development, in their self-esteem, their civic involvement, their social inclusion and their engagement in intercultural dialogue."
"Several sets of research findings have shown that learning has important non-economic benefits such as promoting good health, fostering participation in the life of society among all age groups and, of course, reducing crime rates."
"It is therefore my political priority to increase people's motivation to engage in lifelong learning."
"Media campaigns, information and advice centres and adapted forms of communication for disadvantaged groups are very important."
"Special phone numbers and websites have also proved highly successful in some countries."
"In this context, great importance also attaches to efforts to reconcile work, family life and lifelong learning."
"Let me list in shorthand just a few means to this end: adaptation of working hours, flexitime, distance-learning programmes and informal learning paths."
"The use of new technology must be constantly perfected, especially through the creation of wider Internet access to encourage recourse to such new learning methods."
"There must be continued growth in the number of public and private day nurseries and company crèches."
"Another important factor, in my view, is solidarity between generations and between cultures."
"Adults and senior citizens who pass on knowledge and technical know-how to younger people, particularly expertise in a trade or in business practice, can play an effective supporting role."
"They can provide practical guidance, and there must also be scope to form networks for this purpose. In this way, I believe, each can learn from the other."
"There is also, however, a family-based approach to learning."
"Parents are motivated to start learning again in order to help their children at school."
"In addition, adult education also depends on voluntary helpers, who enrich it by lending their experience and providing skilled instruction."
"The special needs of migrants must also be taken into account, which brings me to the subject of language courses."
"We need these language courses to enable migrants to learn the language of their host country, but we also need language courses to enable adults to learn the language of a neighbouring country or another foreign language, which is something we have always advocated."
"Access to institutions of higher education must also be made easier for adults with practical vocational experience."
"One very important message is that the quality of existing adult-education centres and the education they offer should be improved."
"There is a need for well-qualified trainers in adult education as well as specific programmes of courses in adult education."
"I can only speak for Germany, where there is a university course that leads to a degree in adult education."
"I believe we must all remind course providers that they can obtain funding for their proposed courses from the European Social Fund, for example, or from any of the structural funds."
"I naturally expect the Commission to offer the present Lifelong Learning programme in both the Grundvig and Leonardo programmes in order to ensure that we too can do our bit to launch the action plan."
"I believe there many ways of performing good work in this field, and we should waste no time in doing so."
"Let me stress one final point: performance in adult education must be made measurable, otherwise no one will know who is doing what."
"There are very many players in this field, and they must all be taken into account, be they private, university-based or public educational establishments."
"There is, in short, a great deal to be done, and I suggest we get down to work."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would very much like to show my appreciation of this report and to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Pack for her commitment, efforts and contributions and also Mr Andersson from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and Ms Flasarová from the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"I am very pleased that our two communications from 2006 and 2007 received a very concrete and strong response from the European Parliament."
"The first was on adult learning and the second, on the European action plan on this matter, adopted in September."
"As you have recognised, the importance of adult learning is clearly increasing."
"First of all, global competition is a reality."
"We need to invest in education at all stages of life and at all levels, and the skills and competences of adults need to be continuously upgraded."
"Secondly, demographic changes mean that people need to work at least some years longer and they need to maintain the relevance of their skills to do this."
"Thirdly, adult learning helps to combat social exclusion."
"Too many adults with low education levels risk being excluded from the labour market."
"So adult learning has a vital role in lifelong learning strategies."
"I welcome your support for many reasons, particularly for improving the quality and accessibility of adult learning, including through better childcare and e-learning, and in particular for groups with special needs, as well as for speeding up the assessment of skills and valuing informal learning, for investing more in general and also for adapting to the needs of women, migrants and the ageing population."
"Last but not least, for developing reliable and comparable data to measure adult learning, as Ms Pack mentioned."
"We will follow up all these elements in implementing the European action plan."
"As you suggest, these are all kinds of good practices in the Member States which we will use in our cooperation."
"We will support these best practices via peer learning activities and studies, through the Lifelong Learning Programme and the European Social Fund mentioned earlier, in order to share knowledge and experience."
"In implementing the action plan with the cooperation of Member States, we will analyse the effect of national reforms on adult learning, especially in the light of the recently adopted European Qualifications Framework."
"We will also develop standards for adult learning professionals and quality assurance mechanisms based on existing good practice."
"We want to encourage Member States to set targets for increasing the skill levels of adults and to speed up the process of assessing and recognising non-formal and informal learning for groups at risk."
"Last but not least, we will propose a set of core data to improve monitoring of the sector."
"I look forward to the debate but in particular to continuous support in this direction."
"rapporteur for an opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, I thank the rapporteur for an excellent report."
"It follows from the entire strategy that we have in the EU and the entire Lisbon process that training should be the key, not just to ensuring growth and employment in the future, but also to combating social exclusion."
"For the EU countries to hold their own in global competition, training and, not just more jobs, but better jobs, as well as people with a high level of skills, play a vital role."
"We therefore welcome this report."
"I have a few more comments to make."
"It is important that we make use of all the resources available in order to facilitate training for different groups."
"An example of these is childcare."
"It must be possible for both men and women who are the parents of young children to take part in training."
"Hence there must also be a strategy for childcare."
"It is important that we look at special groups, for example the elderly."
"There are very few elderly people in the workforce today."
"This is to a large extent due to the fact that they do not have access to continuing training and adult education."
"We must concentrate on that group."
"Another group are people starting with a low level of education."
"If we consider the training situation today, looking at continuing training and adult education, we notice that it is those who are already well educated who get the most training."
"It is important that we have an equality aspect in training as well."
"Since my speaking time is short, I will merely point out in conclusion that it is important to have good cooperation and to include the social partners in this process."
"draftsman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the report by my colleague Mrs Pack and I congratulate her on the way in which she has dealt with the topic."
"I would like to stress the need to pay attention to the education of women, the socially vulnerable, immigrants and minorities."
"I would like to mention one other aspect of education."
"In a world where most things are subordinate to finances, trade, advertising, careers and competition in the labour market, education often appears to be merely a stepping stone to a better social position."
"If education achieves this practical aim and makes a person better prepared for work, and if that person can keep up with the competitive environment, that is certainly a good thing."
"However, the most important aspect of education is that it makes a person richer on the inside and better equipped to distinguish good from bad."
"Society is experiencing a crisis of values."
"Instead of traditions and authorities, we have the individual freedom for which we have been striving throughout our modern history."
"However, it is also the freedom to know or not to know, the freedom to see and the freedom to keep one's eyes closed, the freedom to form one's own opinions and the freedom to accept the ideas of others."
"Education on its own will not solve our problems, but it can encourage us to think about them ."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Commissioner, the European demographical situation makes it necessary to reorganise pension systems and raise the age limit, and we are hearing more and more about controlled immigration instead of realising the hidden potential of our own over-50s."
"Well organised adult education enables experts who have worked for several decades to refresh their knowledge and adapt to the changed circumstances."
"It also enables adults who are excluded from the labour market but not of retirement age to be engaged and undertake work, through retraining, language, IT and other professional training."
"This function of adult education is particularly topical in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, where the employment indices fall well behind the average for the EU-15."
"In addition to its bearing on the labour market, adult education also has a third, social and personal dimension, since Internet language courses, dancing classes or cookery courses organised for elderly people contribute to improving their quality of life and to their positive frame of mind."
"There are two things that I consider to be particularly important for effective adult education: on the one hand, improvements to information and access, the presentation of successful projects and the sharing of experiences with those concerned."
"Let us not forget that a tiny proportion of elderly people in the new Member States use the Internet, and we must use conservative, traditional methods that they can access."
"A prominent role in this falls to local governments, who have detailed knowledge of the local conditions and needs."
"On the other hand, assessing needs is an important task, that is to say, Member States should reach agreement with economic players, businesses and employers when designing their adult education programmes."
"The economic needs of the country in question must be taken into account so that the amount spent on adult education is not money needlessly squandered, but bears demonstrable value to the individual, to society and to the economy."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Pack on her important and timely report. Thank you for your attention."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, on an excellent piece of work and on her cooperative attitude towards our suggestions."
"I wish to highlight the opportune timing of this report at a time when the scale of socioeconomic changes, the rapid transition towards an information society and the demographic trend associated with an ageing European population all require significant effort in the education and training of adults and lifelong learning."
"They are key aspects of attaining what we refer to as the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"In the report itself I would like to draw attention to the need to foster motivation in people to continue learning."
"I believe, however, that to be effective, this should be accompanied by active policies which above all help to make learning compatible with family and working life, particularly for women."
"These measures should take the form of incentives for going on training programmes and more particularly for broadening public childcare and education services, as well as care for the elderly, in short for dependants, so as to release families from burdens which in many cases still fall on women."
"Moreover, I am convinced that it is appropriate to foster a learning culture which acknowledges merit and improves the employment prospects of poorly qualified people, helps increase social inclusion and personal development."
"This approach is particularly important for 'at risk' groups."
"I also view it as essential to modernise higher education systems and make them more flexible so that they become more responsive to people's growing and diverse social needs while improving the quality of education and broadening supply."
"Finally, I wish to refer to the importance of broadening the supply of training in digital technologies to reduce the digital gap which also exists within our societies between sexes, between generations, and between the populations of different geographical areas."
"In short, I welcome the Commission proposal and I hope it takes account of Parliament's proposals so that we can jointly help raise the awareness of the Member States to the need to act as soon as possible in this area, not only so as to remove barriers to adult involvement in learning, but to encourage it, recognise its economic, social and cultural value in all countries and exchange national data which enable the progress being made to be compared and measured."
"Lifelong learning is becoming more and more important in modern society."
"It is gratifying that the significance and necessity of adult learning is being analysed more and more actively and is better acknowledged in all EU Member States and the main institutions."
"Adult education experts in Lithuania are also actively putting forward proposals for this communication."
"The government programme plans to extend the provision of informal adult education services in municipal educational institutions, to try to ensure that educational institution buildings and the adult education environment are modern and attractive and that centres are provided with modern teaching aids."
"I would also like to emphasise that adult educators and their organisations need a more active voice and that politicians must listen to this and support it in order to achieve advances in the area of qualitative changes in adult education."
"Not only must we discuss the problems that arise, but we must also solve them appropriately, because this will determine how adult education is developed over the coming years."
"The problem in Lithuania is pressingly relevant in this context - the integration of vulnerable groups in society, and the disabled in particular."
"Moreover, the possibilities for adults raising pre-teen children to learn after working hours have not yet been solved."
"Often parents cannot learn simply because they have nowhere to leave their children."
"There is also a lack of flexibility in the adult education system."
"Sometimes people who have not finished secondary school and are still under the age of 18 want to continue their studies under adult education programmes, but they cannot do so because such education is allowed only from the age of 18."
"Certainly, insufficient funding is also an important problem."
"I would agree with the President of Lithuania, Valdas Adamkus, who said that more and more people in Lithuania understand that learning is not just a young person's duty."
"Today, lifelong learning is becoming a challenge for our country and its citizens."
"We need to grasp this opportunity because we will be able to show the rapidly changing world that Lithuania is creative, open to innovation and not afraid of setting ambitious goals when opening up possibilities and ways of learning."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would also like to begin by thanking Mrs Pack and congratulating her on her report - because of her willing attitude most of the amendments tabled by our Group were also incorporated into it."
"I would like to say that adult education has always been one of the best ways both to effect social and economic development and to contribute to better wealth distribution."
"Now, in this changing information society where we must continually update our knowledge, the initial basic education of adults, and subsequent ongoing training, is a need of the first order."
"Adults must adapt to the continuous change imposed by globalisation and take decisions in order to be able to survive while maintaining an adequate quality of life."
"However, most educational systems do not respond sufficiently to people's requirements in such a way as to be able to keep sufficiently abreast of the changing society in which they live."
"In contrast to previous eras, the role of education is not to obtain lessons to be applied in a known world, but in a world of continuous change which may produce unforeseeable circumstances."
"The point is therefore to provide a system of education which can respond to the needs of adults in a society undergoing permanent change."
"In short, education must prepare people for looking ahead and for innovation and must no longer concern itself with just fitting in."
"We are in transit between an industrial and post-industrial society, and the type of society towards which we are moving will form the framework for adult education; on that point I have congratulated the rapporteur and would also like to congratulate the Commission because I believe that the current report is in that vein."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, lifelong learning is something the UK has always excelled at."
"Our Open University was the first establishment of its kind in the world, founded in the 1960s and based on a concept dating from the 1920s."
"Hundreds of thousands of so-called 'mature students' have graduated from the Open University, many of them graduates returning to their studies."
"Therefore I think the UK is fine when it comes to lifelong learning and, with respect, I do not think we need to accept any more interference from this place in education, which is still a national competence."
"However, just making it available is never enough for this place. The next step, of course, is compulsion."
"After all, what is the point of providing something that is not used?"
"But, then, you do have a history in this area of billions of euros and other currencies wasted by EU institutions, and nation states blithely following orders is par for the course."
"But bringing this closer to home - specifically to bureaucrats and politicians in this House - it is now obvious to me that no matter how long you live, you simply do not learn!"
"You do not even want to listen."
"You just carry on with the projects and to hell with anyone who might not agree or have a different point of view."
"I am reminded of the old saying, attributed to Sun Tzu but famously used by Kennedy: those who make peaceful protest impossible make violent protest inevitable."
"If you do not learn from your mistakes, you are doomed to repeat them."
"(SK) First of all, please allow me to thank Mrs Doris Pack for all the energy she put into the preparation of this report."
"I would also like to thank the representatives of the European Commission for the initiatives that lead to the improvement of the existing situation."
"As the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education on the European Qualifications Framework, I consider the issue of lifelong education to be very important, primarily from two points of view."
"The first is the improvement in qualifications, an increase in the ability to find work and overcome discrepancies in the labour market, as well as an improvement in geographical and professional mobility."
"The second is the quest for lifelong personal development and integration into society."
"Too few adults participate in education and vocational training."
"I believe that focusing on improving the citizens' motivation with regard to life-long learning is a positive step."
"It is fundamental in this process to take into consideration the improvement of conditions for the reconciliation of working and family life, solidarity between generations and cultures, language learning and an improvement in the quality of education and its prospects."
"What is to be commended is the recognition and appreciation of non-formal and informal education."
"The important objectives are to improve the qualifications of workers with few qualifications, who form one third of the European workforce - up to 72 million people - and, finally, the education of immigrants."
"If we wish to achieve by 2010 the benchmark goal of 12.5% participation in adult learning, which means the participation of a further 4 million people - one of the requirements will be to establish a connection between the education systems at European level and the National Qualification Frameworks."
"I should like to reassure Mrs Pack that the Chair's acknowledgements are a proper and institutional token of respect for rapporteurs and the opinions that they express, even when we are completely at odds with their content."
"Mr President, 'a good priest learns until death' says the Hungarian proverb."
"In these days not only the priest, but all adults should learn during their adult years."
"I welcome Ms Pack's report and the Commission's Adult Learning Action Plan as well."
"Of course, it is very sad that only 9.6% of our adult citizens participate in lifelong learning."
"It is not easy to start learning when you have grown up."
"The harmonisation of family life, working life and learning is a hard task, but in the longer term both the family and the professional career may benefit from adult learning."
"In Europe we have millions of unemployed people and at the same time millions of empty jobs requiring skilled employees."
"The low level of qualifications implies a high risk of unemployment, but continuous training and learning may help both the person and the economy."
"I agree with Ms Pack that not only should lifelong learning be promoted, but economic tools are also needed to encourage employers to hire older workers."
"There is only one solution for the challenge of our ageing society: to respect older workers and provide proper jobs for the older generation as well."
"Of course, for these we need lifelong learning and also lifelong vocational training."
"(RO) We are aware that Member States recognise the extremely important role of lifelong learning, as it contributes to the citizens' welfare, self-confidence, social integration, and intercultural dialogue."
"Nevertheless, the access of adults to lifelong learning programmes remains limited, despite the European Union's aim of achieving 12.5% participation by 2010."
"This is why the implementation and promotion by Member States of effective European programs for the education and training of adults, especially the elderly, the disabled and migrants, could lead to their more successful integration in society and increased mobility on the labour market."
"As a member of the Committee on Education and Culture, I believe that the development of volunteer programmes concerning solidarity between generations and the involvement of government, private enterprise and individuals is a key point for taking up the new challenges posed by demographic change, poverty and social exclusion."
"By virtue of the right to literacy and education, and of the Member States' obligation to provide quality training for their adult citizens, I believe, Mr President, that we too are responsible for the development of sustainable tools for funding and supporting lifelong education and training."
"Mr President, if the Commissioner were to ask people where they learn, they would tell him where they went to school."
"But most of the learning we do is outside this experience of formal education."
"The challenge in lifelong learning is not only to offer opportunities to adults to gain new and more qualifications, but also to find a way to recognise and capitalise on the very valuable learning many adults have gained informally through life and work experience."
"A constituent of mine has pioneered the successful handling of some of the most difficult fish varieties and also the environmentally friendly fish-farming techniques that they require."
"He has no college degree, so when the Commission gives grants in this field, they do not go to him."
"Instead, the grants go to academics with no experience, who then come to him to find out how he does what he does."
"He is tired of this rip-off, and the fishing industry will be the poorer for this."
"I urge the Commissioner to look at this as there has to be a better way."
"(CS) Mr Chairman, Commissioner, the greatest obstacles that prevent adults from taking part in education are lack of time due to work or family commitments."
"Another negative factor is the lack of information and lack of motivation: according to general opinion, education later in life is not valued enough and not rewarded enough."
"An important aspect of adult education is its effectiveness and fairness."
"The educational systems of the EU Member States focus primarily on the education and professional training of young people."
"Only a little progress has been made in changing this situation and that progress has so far been of little significance."
"The general objective must therefore be to make maximum use of the various providers of education in the adult educational system."
"It is our aim to enable access to good and timely information on the possibilities of adult education and to explain the entry requirements and costs, not to mention the advantages of completing such education."
"I agree with the view of the rapporteur that the Member States must introduce quality consultation systems and financial incentives targeted at individuals."
"They must also support the development of local partnerships."
"In addition, it is important to introduce a system for the recognition and verification of the results of such education in the context of national qualifications, taking into account the European Qualifications Framework."
"The advantages of investing in adult education are also confirmed by the research done by the OECD."
"The public and private benefits include higher employability, increased work productivity, lower unemployment benefit expenditure, lower social benefits expenditure and lower early retirement."
"This report invites us to reconsider the stated policy priorities in the field of adult education and take concrete steps."
"I congratulate our rapporteur."
"(ET) Ladies and gentlemen."
"Enlargement in 2004 increased economic growth in the European Union by an amount which engendered unjustified confidence."
"However, today the cooling of the economy is causing social tensions even in the new Member States."
"I am referring to the bill on employment contracts which is currently causing controversy in my home country, Estonia."
"In anticipation of redundancies, Estonian businesspeople are trying to make people who are to be made redundant bear the brunt of the social effects of the disappearance of employment."
"Perhaps those who are more vulnerable, namely employees who have lost their jobs, are once again at a loss as to what they are being punished for."
"In the absence of effective steps, both secure flexibility and lifelong learning are reduced merely to empty words in whose shadow the more vulnerable in society are left without the support they need."
"Raising the retirement age in line with the rise in average life expectancy means that a 45-year-old worker has yet to reach the mid-point of his career."
"It means a new beginning in middle age."
"Yet discrimination on grounds of age and sex is an undeniable reality in work places the world over, including the European Union."
"The trend towards having children later in life means that women find it twice as difficult to return to the labour market."
"The Lifelong Learning Programme is an opportunity at least to a certain degree to compensate for the injustice which prevails today."
"Similarly, employers should be encouraged to invest in people with experience of life."
"Employers should be persuaded that knowledge and skills learnt in other areas of life, yes, even in home economics, are extremely valuable."
"I wish to stress once again that the lifelong learning system is merely a supplement to the social pledges, not a replacement for them."
"Drivers, no matter how experienced, should always fasten their seatbelts."
"I thank and congratulate the rapporteur on a fine piece of work. Thank you, Mrs Pack!"
"(SL) Man is a most adaptable creature, which is why many adults have already accepted the fact that one should keep acquiring knowledge even in mature years and in old age."
"In future, those people who have never stopped learning will certainly have an advantage in adapting to the rapid changes with which we are faced on a daily basis."
"It is also important for the well-being of the elderly for them to continue participating in the shaping of society by using their knowledge and experience."
"This gives them the satisfaction of knowing that they are useful and needed in society."
"Because the population is getting older, new occupations best suited to the elderly will have to be created."
"A friend of mine, who has ten children and no grandmother to help bring them up, asked me: ""Do you know where I could buy a granny for my children?”"
"I also often recall the story of a doctor who asked a retired teacher to teach a badly burned boy in hospital."
"The boy was not expected to survive."
"Due to the teacher's persistence, patience and experience, the boy started responding to her questions."
"He started believing in life."
"Why would doctors send a teacher to work so hard with a boy whom they did not believe would survive?"
"An elderly person's knowledge saved a young life."
"The young have many abilities and advantages in learning which sometimes they do not fully exploit, but older people must find willpower and receive encouragement because it is never too late to acquire knowledge and they can compensate for things for which, perhaps, there was no time or money in their youth."
"Acquiring knowledge means enjoying life more fully."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this century it is surely not difficult to convince anyone that general and vocational education can no longer be confined to school and the immediate post-school years but has to be updated and extended throughout people's working lives."
"Changing demographic trends, for example, provide sufficient evidence of this requirement."
"In this context, Mrs Pack's excellent report puts forward a host of good ideas and very successfully conveys the need to create a culture of learning, particularly among adults."
"To this end she lists a number of measures that should be taken at various levels."
"Adult education is, of course, primarily a task for the Member States."
"For this reason the EU cannot prescribe action; instead, we must make suggestions and request, encourage and invite the Member States to offer a range of measures that will bring more people into adult education."
"Like the rapporteur, I firmly believe - and I say this as vice-chairman of the Committee on Regional Development - that many Member States are not fully aware of the significance and use of the European Social Fund and other structural funds as instruments in the pursuit of lifelong learning."
"They should monitor the structural funds with this objective in mind as well as ensuring that more resources are made available for those whose need of lifelong learning is greatest."
"In short, the report calls clearly on the Member States to make active use of instruments such as the European Social Fund and on the Commission to reinforce specific programmes in the field of adult education."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to speak this evening in a House which, I have to say, is well attended."
"The report on adult learning 'it is never too late to learn' has been presented to us today by Mrs Pack with her customary intelligence and expertise."
"I am pleased to see the representatives of the Commission, including Mr Figel', who is among the most active and enthusiastic in his work, because there is a real need for commitment, since this issue - that is, the education and learning of younger, working or older people - is one that could really bring citizens closer to Europe."
"I should like to say something about a group of adults who could benefit from this learning: because there are adults of the first, second and third ages."
"By third-age adults I mean those who have stopped working, enteredretirement and can finally settle down to study the subject which they have always wanted to study, but have never had the time to study in any depth. I, for instance, would study astronomy, others might study physics or geography."
"In my view it is right and important for Europe to smooth the transition from work and working age to non-working age, during which people are just as entitled to learn and to be educated."
"For that reason I am very content with this report and this initiative by the European Parliament to promote learning among older people as well."
"- (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, when fighting unemployment, the objective at the heart of the strategy is to make it easier for employees to adapt to the labour market, and this can be achieved through lifelong learning."
"The objective was that by 2010 at least 12% of people would take part in adult education."
"We are now aware that the target will not be reached."
"However, I would like to note that there are some countries, such as Holland and Austria, that have already achieved the Lisbon objective thanks to significant incentives, such as the division of time and financial expenditure between employees, companies and the State."
"The Danish experience is also valuable."
"Here the rotation of workers facilitates the development of qualifications."
"When an employee is undergoing training, his place is taken by a person who at that time is unemployed."
"These countries, and others, prove that it can be done, that flexibility of the labour market is the way towards innovations that create new jobs."
"The result is the lowest level of long-term unemployment: long-term unemployment in Denmark is only 0.8%."
"I would like to believe that the situation will fundamentally change even in the new countries on the back of examples and huge incentives provided by the European Social Fund."
"I welcome the Commission communication and the report by Mrs Pack."
"(RO) Indeed, it's never too late to learn."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her handling of this topic, which is an essential one at European level and beyond."
"Unfortunately, many citizens still believe that education is something one acquires in the first part of one's life."
"We must encourage access to European funds available for adult education, particularly in Member States that have recently joined the Union."
"The degree of absorption of funds is rather low in these states, and the number of people involved in professional retraining and lifelong learning is very low."
"I believe it is essential to change the mentality of young people still at the initial stage of their education, so as to prepare them for a Europe on the move."
"By developing new, European-level programs, we should instil in them the idea that training does not end once you've obtained your first qualification."
"It's important to be aware that anyone, anytime, can acquire new skills and competences, irrespective of their age, ethnicity, gender, or location."
"Taking all these into account, a fundamental precept emerges: we must be able to learn."
"(SK) Ladies and gentlemen, the very rapid changes in the structure of the labour market require highly-qualified workers."
"People with few qualifications remain on the fringe of social and economic progress."
"Creativity and innovation are the key factors of the modern age."
"The more inventive a man is, the more creative a source for the economy he is."
"Prosperous economies are those that invest in people (and that means in education), in the basic technological and language skills of the workforce."
"It is important to awaken, through lifelong learning, the abilities that are lying dormant in people of all ages and waiting to be used."
"I believe that this wonderful report by the rapporteur, Doris Pack, 'Adult learning: It is never late to learn', will not remain mere words;"
"I believe that we will succeeding in converting it into action."
"Commissioner Figeľ, thank you for your personal involvement in the field of lifelong learning."
"(RO) I join my colleagues in congratulating Mrs Doris Pack on her work as rapporteur."
"The topic is very important for today's Europe and especially for tomorrow's Europe."
"The development of a new society as well as social cohesion are intimately linked to education, and by education we should not think only of formal education, but we should also encourage non-formal and informal education highly focused on the individual."
"I would like to draw attention to the importance of migrant education."
"I believe we have seen in practice that education for migrants is necessary for their social integration, for tolerance, stability, performance, and for overall European development."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, and also the Commissioner, who is carrying out his duties in an excellent manner, also with regards to his work for the European Institute of Technology."
"Today, however, we are discussing something else. I would like to draw attention to one particular issue."
"At the beginning of the 20th century Europe was fighting illiteracy; by the second half of the 20th century all Europeans could read and write."
"Today's illiteracy is lack of computer skills and lack of Internet access."
"I would like to propose that there be an even greater emphasis on this issue."
"The digital divide also affects the generation gap."
"The issue is that we should know in how many years, five years or ten years, every European will know how to use a computer, whatever their age, and will have Internet access."
"Internet cafes could be used for this in very remote parts of Europe, where several computers are put into a single room, and all the inhabitants could use this location."
"This is the challenge of the 21st century."
"Member of the Commission. - (SK) I think that many of the contributions made are indeed an incentive to get involved in the issue of adult education."
"Following this philosophy, and as has already been pointed out, it is never too late to learn."
"The second document says that there is always a good reason or a good time to learn."
"I would like to say that I see the report of Doris Pack, and the numerous initiatives that have been mentioned here, as a complement or an addition to what the Commission itself suggested."
"This philosophy is therefore very valuable and welcome."
"I would like to refer back to some of the specific measures, because they are helping and improving what is important to the approach as a whole: the importance of motivating adults to get involved in education; the need to ensure a better reconciliation of work, family life and life-long learning; the need for inter-generational and inter-cultural solidarity; the importance of language learning or teaching; respect for the specific requirements of vulnerable groups and the importance of high-quality teachers, which has been discussed recently: it is one of the key factors for educational success; and a better approach to higher education and creation of comparative statistical data or information."
"The Commission will also reflect on your invitation to assess the career prospects linked to adult education and the subject of the financing of adult education."
"These are very precise questions, which also fall within the remit of the Member States."
"Finally, one the outcomes not only of this report but also of the Commission's documents will be the discussion of the Member States and conclusions of the Council of Ministers in February."
"I believe that they will be sincere and support adult education that is accessible and of a high quality."
"Please allow me one thought in conclusion: it is not only appreciation and gratitude, but also an appreciation of inspiration."
"As a Commissioner, a politician as well as a father, I am convinced that education - and I mean accessible and high-quality education - is the most important factor for the political, economic, social and cultural development of individuals and society as a whole."
"Moreover, education is the great equaliser, which means that it is an equaliser of those issues that are necessary for the equality of all."
"Thank you very much and I look forward to our cooperation."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, first of all may I thank everyone involved for the flowers they have presented to me."
"I would be happy to give a few blooms from this bouquet to Jan Figeľ."
"After having campaigned for adult education since 1993 and having seen the first fruits of these efforts, I am gratified that we have now achieved the great breakthrough in that the importance of adult education is recognised in every sphere of political activity."
"I am particularly keen that every possible incentive be created to motivate adults to re-enter the education process."
"Many have never had the opportunity, and many need to be motivated."
"There is also a need to overcome these people's inhibitions and remove barriers."
"This is why I also believe that the numerous adult-education centres, foundations and charitable organisations which, as we know, are already doing outstanding work in this field should be supported and that these providers' high standards - and I see no reason why they cannot become even higher - should be maintained."
"As I said before, we must ensure that the quality of adult education is further improved."
"I was delighted to hear that a working group had already been formed in your area of the Commission, Mr Figeľ."
"I am pleased that it can perhaps be linked with Grundvig too so that we can light the fuse, as it were, for the national governments."
"Let us therefore make a start."
"The many fine words really must now give way to deeds, and our task is simply to disprove the venerable saying 'You can't teach an old dog new tricks'."
"In the context of adult education that is as wrong as anything can be, which is why I hope that we can now try, by dint of our own efforts and with your help, to hoist the national governments into the saddle so that they can start trotting, for it will take a while before they are ready to gallop."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on this item will take place on Wednesday, 16 January 2008 at 12 noon."
"Witten statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the Committees for their successful and eminently social work."
"At the same time, I was sorry to note that there was not a single reference in it to the question of developing information and communication skills."
"We should just think of how much legislation we have created over the years that recognises new rights for European citizens and in how many cases we have prescribed that workers, consumers, pensioners or even tourists should have the relevant information and channels on the Internet."
"All these things make sense if the beneficiaries can access the information."
"The development of 'eskills' in lifelong learning and in general basic education will assume vital importance, as the foundation stone of a knowledge-based information society."
"Another key task for Member States will be promoting equal opportunities in IT and electronic inclusion."
"I am delighted that every Hungarian party agrees on this, even if they do not agree on many other things."
"Modern information and communication technologies in themselves present an unprecedented opportunity to really promote cohesion and equal opportunities, but we can only use this opportunity if we guarantee the conditions to include everyone throughout their lives, so that, even for 'eskills', the title of the Committee's opinion will inevitably be true: 'It is never too late'."
"Commission measures in 2008-2013 to make use of CAP remote-sensing applications (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the measures to be undertaken by the Commission in 2008-13 making use of the remote-sensing applications developed within the framework of the common agricultural policy - C6-0273/2007 -."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, before going into the content of the report, I first of all want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for the work that they have been doing on the evaluation of the Commission's proposal."
"I would first like to make a few more general remarks to place the Commission's proposal in the right context."
"The Commission's proposal concerns the agro-meteorological system utilised to prepare the crop yields forecast and to monitor the development of crops within the European Union."
"This system was developed throughout the 1990s and has been fully operational since 1998."
"I must say that I consider this to be a very useful tool."
"This system provides the Commission's services with accurate information on the situation in the crop sector and also assists the Commission in taking timely decisions in the framework of the common agricultural policy, and therefore I find that it is quite natural that it is financed by the guidance funding."
"Let me say the following on some of the proposals in the Committee on Agriculture report."
"You have concerns about the use of the data that are collected."
"I want to be very clear on this."
"Control is not the aim of this system and it cannot and will not be used for any control of farmers within the European Union."
"When we look at it from a technical point of view, the resolution of the remote-sensing images generated by the system is far too low to allow any controls, and this system - it must be clear as well - has nothing to do with our Integrated Administration and Control (IACS) System."
"The rapporteur also states that there is no consensus that the proposed system actually works."
"Work to develop the system started in the late 1980s and, as I said, since 1998, when it became operational, the system has actually provided yield forecasts on a regular basis to the Commission services."
"We use this information on a daily basis, for example in our analysis of supply and price developments within the cereal sector."
"Last year, in September 2007, the Commission provided an assessment of the system in a report to the European Parliament and to the Council that actually demonstrated the usefulness of the system."
"The system is also implemented at national level in several Member States, and other countries are using or developing similar tools, so on this point I am not totally in line with you."
"Finally, I welcome the principle of setting up an inventory of projects and initiatives in the field of space and remote-sensing."
"However, this proposal is not the right place for this."
"This would indeed fall under the European initiative of Global Monitoring for Environment and Security."
"So we are not exactly on the same page, but I look forward to listening to the comments of the Honourable Members."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, in the coordination committee of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development we pondered whether to produce a report on this matter or to let it pass without a report."
"I had the task of examining this question in greater depth, and we subsequently decided that we would draft a report, which means that the two of us can discuss the matter again this evening - a useful thing in itself."
"We did stumble over a few points, however, and this is reflected in the amendments we have formulated."
"Firstly, the Commission's report said that the proposal was largely uncontested in the Council as elsewhere."
"Our enquiries, however, have revealed that some countries, particularly in northern Europe, cannot do much with this satellite data because everything is still covered in snow there when the images are captured."
"Secondly, the data is collected by private companies, which make it available to the Commission, and these private companies' main customers are in the gas and oil industries, an area of business that involves a degree of speculation."
"What we must ensure - and this is why we want to invoke our parliamentary powers of scrutiny - is that this collected data is truly unconnected with any private speculative ambitions but that is actually used, as you have said, for the sole purpose of harvest and yield forecasting."
"As you are also aware, however, this very data is used for speculation in commodity futures on the stock exchange, and such forecasts could be used for that purpose."
"Before going any further, let me emphasise that the Commission and Parliament do share a common interest here, but Parliament has a scrutiny function, and so it makes sense for us to talk about that and to request reports from the Commission which show clearly what has happened to this data, how it is recorded and what purpose it serves."
"It is essentially a matter of calling you to account in the coming years."
"Then we were somewhat puzzled, of course, to learn that the financial basis for this data collection was suddenly to be changed."
"Hitherto we have had a dedicated budget heading under which increases in appropriations and proposals for their retention have had to be discussed."
"Now these activities are to be transferred to the Guarantee Fund, over which Parliament has less power of scrutiny."
"Now we can assume that, when the Treaty enters into force at the start of 2009, the Guarantee Fund will no longer exist and these matters will therefore pass into full budgetary sovereignty of Parliament."
"This approach was at least proposed, and when we received the report it was not yet clear when the Treaty would materialise."
"So we said no, we did not want to make any changes now; it should stay as it was, namely in a budget line which could then be scrutinised by Parliament on the expenditure side."
"All in all, Commissioner, I certainly believe we have more important problems to discuss and try to resolve concerning the health check than the subject of our deliberations here this evening."
"Farmers, however, are very sensitive when there is any suspicion that they are being spied upon."
"You have made it clear that this is not about surveillance or spying."
"I shall gladly pass on that message, but you must understand us."
"We as a Parliament must also ensure that you do."
"It is because of our accountability to our voters that we have discussed this matter and are making this point."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, good evening, another evening discussing agriculture."
"As the Commission notes in its report, in recent years remote sensing has shown how we can cope correctly with the management needs of the Common Agricultural Policy."
"The traditional statistical and agricultural forecasting systems are beginning to become obsolete with the new technology which is invading all aspects of our lives."
"It has also made possible improvements in the accuracy, objectivity, speed and frequency of observations as well as achieving savings in follow-up costs and monitoring of agricultural expenditure."
"Remote sensing is, therefore, most welcome in the Common Agricultural Policy."
"The draft report which will be put to the vote tomorrow generally endorses the European Commission, except on one point which I consider to be important as it concerns funding for the measure."
"In the Agriculture Committee I supported the rapporteur's proposal to establish a specific budget for remote sensing of EUR 9.2 million outside the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund to safeguard future Community support for the development of remote sensing in all Member States."
"I therefore welcome the outcome of the vote of the Committee on Agriculture, whose report also sets out the need to use the computer facilities of the Joint Research Centre site in Ispra to compile data from space, rather than the idea of creating a new computing infrastructure as proposed by the European Commission."
"We should therefore streamline both the infrastructures and the financial budget, and we in the House should therefore support the document which will be put to the vote tomorrow."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is nothing technology will not do."
"We have before us a proposal by the European Commission for extension of the programme that uses the most up-to-date technology to monitor our European agriculture."
"After years of research, the scientists concerned can be justifiably proud of themselves."
"Using satellites, it is, for instance, possible to monitor the use and condition of land, study the effects of climate change and even forecast harvests."
"That means we can keep an eye on the situation and act in good time to predict and ward off problems, such as the failure of the grain harvest this year."
"I was originally an engineer and I find this kind of practical application of principled technology to promote our well-being very exciting."
"A 'tom-tom' system for agriculture."
"Who would ever have thought it?"
"Now we have to consider whether we as a Parliament are in favour of further research into and use of this application."
"How could we say no?"
"I recommend that my colleagues in the Socialist Group vote for this directive, but I do want to make a couple of comments to the Commissioner who is with us at this late hour."
"Firstly, I have my doubts about the inclusion of the budget and the programme in the Agricultural Guarantee Fund."
"Up to now this project has had its own budget heading, which has allowed Parliament to monitor the situation and be kept regularly informed."
"Despite the proven value of the programme, research is still continuing."
"I would think it particularly unfortunate if the Commission no longer reported to us on the progress and results of the programme, or on the costs involved."
"As a Member of Parliament and an interested party, I would urge that the separate budget heading is retained so that we are also kept informed in the future and can be involved in the consideration as well."
"Secondly, I would like to see all the research results made freely available to other interested parties, such as universities and research institutes."
"In the field of climate research particularly, the data that are coming to light thanks to MARS and LUCAS can be enormously useful."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I shall conclude my maiden speech at this plenary with that appeal for transparency."
"I am hoping for a positive response from Mrs Fischer Boel."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for the excellent way he has prepared this topic for debate."
"He has worked hard and highlighted the flaws and problems associated with remote sensing."
"A cautious approach, an emphasis on transparency and a precise specification of the scope of application are all appropriate here."
"At its best remote sensing is a way to obtain information quickly on the condition of farms, crop yields and growing conditions."
"This information can then be used, for example, in research, the planning of agricultural marketing, and the administration of the common agricultural policy."
"There are still many flaws in the methods used, as the rapporteur points out."
"Conditions vary from one Member State to another and the data from Member States is not fully comparable."
"For example, in my country, Finland, snow-covered parcels of land are often so small that determining surface areas from satellite images is not always successful."
"This being the case, the amendment which states that the information obtained should be used solely for estimating yields and not for control purposes is fitting."
"Farmers today are burdened with red tape, paperwork and constant monitoring."
"Unreasonably harsh sanctions are imposed if they unintentionally make mistakes owing to poor advice."
"As remote sensing methods develop, it is to be hoped that they will help reduce the bureaucracy which is a continual torment to farmers."
"First, however, we need to obtain more precise results of research to ensure that the methods are actually reliable and that they treat all farmers impartially."
"As new methods are introduced, we also have to ensure that the privacy of farmers is protected and that the entire process is a transparent one."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, in order to have a common agricultural policy that works properly, what is needed, above all, is precise and reliable data."
"Remote-sensing techniques make it possible, among other applications, to monitor cultivation and to forecast harvests."
"This becomes even more significant in the light of advancing climate change."
"Using remote sensing we can identify, at an earlier stage, conditions that are unfavourable for plant development and, as a result, forecast more quickly and accurately which areas are threatened by drought."
"These techniques provide data for econometric models, which we frequently use when considering the consequences of introducing changes into the functioning of the common agricultural policy."
"With initial data that is more precise we can reduce the probability of errors in the scenarios forecast."
"For this reason, I believe that it is vital to continue the MARS project."
"Financing sources for the project should, however, remain unchanged, i.e. within the framework of a separate budget line, and not from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund."
"Since the project is financed from EU funds, i.e. from the taxes of our citizens, I believe that an investigation should be carried out on the efficiency of the MARS project and on its potential applications that have not yet been put into use."
"As usual I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report, and I fully agree with him that we must make sure that the system becomes more consolidated and, above all, more productive and more useful."
"The final issue that I would like to consider is access to data."
"Everyone should have the right to make use of this source of information, not just EU decision-makers but also Member States and research and academic institutions."
"The data could even be useful at the level of the farm: for example, farmers could apply the information obtained from remote sensing in optimising agricultural treatments."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to support the view taken by the rapporteur and emphasise that remote-sensing techniques can be useful to the European Commission: first of all, in helping to manage agricultural markets, secondly, by making it possible to monitor cultivation and at the same time to forecast harvests, and thirdly and finally, this forecasting should have an impact on the prices of agricultural raw materials, which will be particularly important in the next few years, in a situation where the prices of foodstuffs are constantly rising."
"Even if some of the objectives named above were to be fulfilled, this would be sufficient to acknowledge that remote sensing is a method that provides important information that is helpful in the proper management of the markets of individual agricultural products."
"At the same time as giving this method a positive assessment, I would also like to state that I share the view of the rapporteur that work in this area should be financed from a special budget line, and not from the Agricultural Guarantee Fund."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was recently invited to a Rotary Club meeting, where a very interesting debate took place."
"A Rotarian who is a fierce critic of the EU lamented that there was a great deal of fraud in Europe, that it went unchecked and that we had a particularly large number of problems in the realm of agriculture."
"Interestingly, a few minutes later we had a farmer saying that he had just undergone an inspection which had been conducted with great rigour and precision and that he did not know of any area of activity that was subject to such thorough checking as agriculture."
"I believe this shows very clearly what people need, namely information about what is actually happening."
"This is why best practice and benchmarking are absolutely essential if we are to explain to the European public how much importance we attach to agricultural policy."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, this proposal for a regulation for the introduction of remote sensing via satellite is an interesting one."
"Michel Debatisse, the French farmers' leader, put forward a remote-sensing proposal in this Chamber back in the 1990s, the area of application in that case being stock rearing."
"The idea was to fix microchips in the ears of cattle and sheep, as part of a system for monitoring premium payments and preventing fraud in certain parts of southern France."
"There had even been a plan for electronic capsules, which cattle would swallow and which would then become attached in a pocket in the intestine, enabling the stock to be identified and counted via satellite."
"What we have before us today is something different, although it dates back seven years, to the MARS and LUCAS pilot projects."
"The concept here entails supplying information about land use and the condition of the ground or crops, in order to forecast crop yields and, at the same time, to manage agricultural markets and produce econometric models."
"There is an obvious danger with this aim of gathering information, improving statistics, producing forecasts and, indeed, creating a website: I am tempted to call it the danger of a remote-sensing elite, for the technology will be accessible only to large farmers or very rich regions, and not everyone will be enabled to anticipate prices - a particularly useful facility when the price of grain is rising."
"Obviously, the ability to anticipate prices several months in advance by predicting the harvest is a highly interesting prospect for the stock markets in Chicago or wherever."
"Our rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, is right to be particularly interested in the matter of who will benefit from the system, especially as it comes at a price - I believe some ten million euros are involved, albeit spread over five or six years - and these sums will come not from an independent budget line but from an agricultural guarantee fund."
"The system is certainly worth trying out, or pursuing, Commissioner."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it is true that we sometimes have the opportunity to sit here late in the evening and discuss agricultural issues, but I must say that I enjoyed, no matter how late it is, having an opportunity to exchange views on this - for those of us present here tonight, anyway - very interesting topic."
"Firstly, it is clear that, in situations where the areas are covered with snow, it is not possible - and this applies to our Finnish friends - to collect the data on the crops, but it is possible to collect the meteorological data, which will be available no matter what the weather conditions are."
"As this is also closely linked to the development that we are seeing in the discussions on climate change, I think that this information is also valid and important."
"There have been some concerns about the availability of the data, and I can only say that the data is available no matter where you come from."
"It is available either through the Member States or on the internet, so there is no secret about the data collected in the different areas."
"Concerning the budget, I think that it is important, in a situation where we have a limited budget for agriculture, that we take care to spend the money in the most appropriate way and that (I refer to Mr Martinez) we can defend how we spend the money and ensure that no fraud is taking place."
"I think that we have also been quite successful in explaining to the European Parliament how we spend the money and how the control is carried out."
"However, it is equally important for me to say again tonight that the technology used in the system to register the field crops does not make it possible to use the same system for control purposes."
"The technology is completely different and the picture is simply unusable for control purposes, so please do not make this link, because it is completely inappropriate."
"However, I still believe that the money that we will spend in the future on this system is justified."
"It will be approximately between EUR 1.5 million and EUR 1.7 million every year."
"Especially in a situation where we have seen dramatic changes in the price fluctuations in the agricultural sector, it is important that we have valid data on which to base our forecasts."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, under the new system the rapporteur has the last word, and therein lies an insight into how the European Parliament sees itself in relation to the Commission."
"As you know, we are not at odds about the next steps in this matter."
"I am not suggesting that the system be scrapped; I have merely proposed a few improvements - which I do not intend to recapitulate - to increase Parliament's powers of scrutiny."
"On the question of data that can be used for climate analysis, we have indicated that there are two pilot projects, entitled LUCAS and MARS."
"This also demonstrates, however, that the data being collected does indeed transcend the domain of agriculture."
"This is why I asked in the explanatory statement for the retention of a separate budget heading."
"Let me conclude with a little anecdote that shows the sort of thing we must deal with. A farm near where I live was visited by the supervisory authority, because the satellite system had allegedly enabled it to identify a gully, in other words a prohibited drainage system."
"The inspectors said it must be over there in a particular spot where the system had shown it to be."
"The farmer, however, assured them that he had done nothing."
"And what had actually happened?"
"A plastic mat was lying in the field - which should not happen either - and the grass had grown through it."
"That was what the satellite system had picked up, and now the authorities had come to haul the farmer over the coals."
"We politicians could surely come up with more little tales like that from our local areas - and no doubt, Commissioner, you have heard a few yourself - which illustrate what we have to deal with. There is no point in denying our concern at the prospect of farmers being monitored in a way which the public cannot comprehend and which is no longer subject to parliamentary scrutiny."
"I therefore hope you will appreciate why we have had to put this report through Parliament and discuss it and why we must continue to be vigilant in future."
"Be that as it may, we do intend to support each other in these efforts."
"I declare the debate closed."
"Voting will take place on Wednesday, 16 January 2008."
"Status of elected MEPs in Poland (debate)"
"The next item is the debate concerning an oral question to the Commission from Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs - B6-0002/2008) concerning the status of MEPs elected in Poland."
"author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue that we are discussing tonight has been examined in detail, on more than one occasion I may say, by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which I have the honour to chair, and that Committee has asked me, through this question, to open a discussion and to exchange views with the Commission."
"The question relates to the status of MEPs elected in Poland, who are not in the same position from the point of view of elections and all the provisions that govern the elections of other parliamentarians in other Member States."
"Elections to the European Parliament in Poland are in practice governed by the Act of 23 January 2004, Article 9 of which sets out eligibility requirements: candidates must be aged 21 on the day of the poll, must not have been convicted of criminal offences, must be resident in Poland and must satisfy various other criteria."
"Chapter 17 of that Act sets out the circumstances in which Polish MEPs may lose their seats: their eligibility, that is the eligibility requirements on the day of the poll, may be invalidated, giving rise to the possibility of forfeiture if these requirements were not met, and various other matters, which I shall not cite in order to get to the crux of the matter that I should like to discuss here."
"On the basis of a number of combined provisions, as we lawyers say, an MEP automatically loses his seat - that is, an MEP automatically forfeits that seat - if he or she has received a criminal conviction; in the case of members of the Polish Parliament, the law of 12 April 2001 - both as regards elections to the Sejm and to the Senate of the Republic - contains no provision of this type, with the result that these provisions relate to Polish MEPs but not to Polish MPs."
"For that reason, we discussed the question and asked ourselves a question, a question which among other things has repercussions as regards requests for immunity; as you know, we have - as Commissioner Frattini is very well aware - the power to decide on this question."
"Clearly, if a member automatically forfeits his or her seat as a result of an event for which immunity cannot be upheld, there is obviously a further problem, a further uncertainty."
"For that reason, we ask, and I ask on behalf of the Committee, the Commissioner whether or not he considers that the Polish legislation on elections to the national parliament breaches Article 10 of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities, which states that during the sessions of the European Parliament, its members shall enjoy the immunities accorded to members of their Parliament in the territory of their own State."
"There is therefore a clear inconsistency if provision is made for a Polish member to lose his or her seat, when members of the national parliament are not treated in the same way."
"I would also ask the Commission if it intends to bring proceedings before the Court of Justice with a view to Poland amending this legislation and correctly applying the treaty, as it would seem that the treaty is not being applied as it should be."
"As an exception is involved, and as the comparable and equal treatment of members from all the Member States means that this exception for members from the Polish state runs completely counter to what may be provided and is provided for all other members from the Member States, I would ask the Commission these two things and put this information before Parliament and ask whether the Commissioner can reply to these two questions and whether it is possible to find a remedy to the questions I have put."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue which Mr Gargani has brought up is undoubtedly an important one: it is important because two principles, both of which are relevant and important in my view, are at stake."
"The first principle is undoubtedly that referred to in Article 10 of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities and on the status of the members of the European Parliament, which specifies that in the States to which the members of the European Parliament belong, they must be accorded the same prerogatives as members of the national parliament of that country."
"However, another provision is also involved - a provision which is also important in my view - and that is Article 13 of the European Act of 1976 relating to the election of members of Parliament."
"That article very clearly states that when a Member State introduces national legislation covering the case in question here, that is the loss of the status, the loss of the position of member of the European Parliament, termination of the European parliamentary mandate in that country is subject to national law."
"In other words, there is an apparent conflict, because the rules set out in the Protocol on Privileges, as cited by Mr Gargani, speak of equal prerogatives for members of the Polish Parliament and members of the European Parliament elected in Poland, but at the same time the European Act of 1976 on the election of members of the European Parliament, as regards the loss of the status of member of the European Parliament, apparently - or explicitly, I would say - governs the loss of the status of MEP and establishes that the loss of that status is governed by national law."
"In my opinion, the problem here is more one of the infringement of a third guiding principle for the European Union: whether or not the principle of equal treatment is enshrined in Polish domestic legislation."
"The principle, enshrined in the constitutional legislation of all the European countries, that establishes that similar situations must be treated in similar ways."
"It is rather that general principle that is at issue; but that general principle does not, however, allow the European Commission to establish the way in which the Polish legal order should change its legislation, because, as the issue is subject to national law, if it were wished in national law to govern the loss of the status of national MP rather than the loss of the status of MEP in a different way, that would be possible, the important factor being that the provisions on one are brought into line with the provisions on the other."
"This is my personal opinion in that the Commission cannot now say 'we are turning to the Court for a ruling that Polish national law has to be amended in a particular way', but I am of the view that a general principle can be drawn."
"The general principle is that the Polish legal order must act to amend this difference in treatment and that, I believe, is a matter for the Polish legislator."
"As this is a question that has never arisen and is too delicate to be dealt with in any summary way, I believe that the first step is to reach an understanding: if the Polish legislator, as I believe, should remove this difference in treatment, that is a matter for the Polish Parliament."
"Second: does Polish legislation comply with the provisions of the European Act of 1976 which I cited earlier?"
"I can tell you, Mr Gargani, that I have commissioned a comparative study for the 12 new Member States to ascertain whether the legislation, not just Polish legislation, but the legislation of the 11 Member States which acceded to the European Union between 2004 and 2007, whether the national legislation in those Member States complies with the provisions of the European Act of 1976."
"In conclusion, two tasks need to be undertaken."
"First: a review, which I am undertaking, of the conformity of Polish national legislation, and not just Polish legislation, because the fact that Mr Gargani has brought up the case of Poland does not mean that there are not comparable situations in other Member States."
"My view is that this review is needed for all of them."
"The second task is to assess whether the Polish Parliament can, though legislation, remove what is objectively an apparent conflict, since there is an apparent discrimination between the status, regulated by law, of MEPs elected in Poland and Polish MPs."
"There is an apparent conflict, and the only aspect that I believe would be difficult to accept is that it is up to the European Commission to ask the Court of Justice what action the Polish legislator should take."
"Were Parliament to agree with this stance, we could simply point out that there is apparent discrimination in Poland between the status of two types of parliamentarian."
"This is a very new exercise and we should try to make progress with it in a spirit of cooperation."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, Chairman Gargani presented the situation of Members of the European Parliament in the context of Polish law very clearly, as also their unequal treatment in this same context as regards Members of Parliament in Poland, and also with regard to senators."
"I would agree with the argument put forward by Commissioner Frattini that this violates the principle of equal treatment of Members of Parliament before the law."
"I would like to inform you that the present ruling coalition in Poland, the Platforma Obywatelska and the Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe, has already begun work on changing this law so as to make it the same for Members of the European Parliament, Members of Parliament in Poland and for Senators."
"This change will follow the same direction as the provision that is contained in the European Parliament's electoral law, so that the same principle also applies to Polish Members of Parliament and Polish Senators."
"However, in this context, as Mr Gargani said that we are opening a discussion concerning a problem that may be a wider issue, I wonder whether it may be worth thinking about a common electoral law, at least in terms of general principles, a common electoral law for the European Parliament for all Member States of the European Union, as today there are very different circumstances in the 27 Member countries."
"It is difficult to disagree, and of course I accept all legal restrictions as regards MEPs, but it is difficult for me to agree with a situation where, on being sentenced to a fine in a case brought by the public prosecution service for a deliberate crime, or for being charged with such a crime, a person automatically loses their mandate to the European Parliament."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, today's debate raises the issue of unequal treatment of Polish Members of the European Parliament and Members of the Sejm as regards election criteria, as well as that of loss of mandate."
"In Article 9 of the Act of 23 January 2004 concerning the electoral ordinance for the European Parliament, we see that the right to stand for election to this institution is given to persons who, among other criteria, have not been convicted of a deliberate crime or charged by the public prosecution service, and Article 142 states that one's mandate can be withdrawn as a result, for example, of the member's election to the European Parliament being invalidated."
"This means that the conviction of a Member (this refers to a Member of the European Parliament, as has been mentioned earlier) for a crime committed deliberately is equivalent to their automatically losing their mandate, while for members to the national parliament this does not act as an obstacle to them standing for election, nor does it result in the loss of their mandate."
"As regards the privileges of Members of the European Parliament, Rule 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament states that 'Members shall enjoy privileges and immunities in accordance with the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities'."
"In the Preamble, the Protocol states that it regulates the issue of privileges and immunities that are necessary to carry out responsibilities for the European Communities, and, in Article 10(a), states that, during the sessions of the Assembly, 'in the territory of their own State, its members shall enjoy the immunities accorded to members of their Parliament'. Members of the Polish Parliament and the European Parliament are protected by the same immunity."
"According to Article 11, 'Representatives of Member States taking part in the work of the institutions of the Communities, their advisers and technical experts shall, in the performance of their duties and during their travel to and from the place of meeting, enjoy the customary privileges, immunities and facilities'."
"There is no doubt that a Member of the European Parliament is a representative of a Member State who is taking part in the work of the institutions of the Union."
"Since Members of the European Parliament and of the Polish Parliament should benefit from the same immunities and privileges, then the rules as regards their eligibility to stand for election as well as for loss of mandate should also be the same."
"In acceding to the European Union Poland assumed a responsibility to respect laws in force in the EU, especially those laws having a direct impact on the internal legal system in Member States."
"I would encourage the fastest possible standardisation in legislation relating to the status of Members of the Polish Parliament and Members of the European Parliament in Poland, and I fully agree with the view taken by Commissioner Frattini in this regard."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the Polish electoral law on elections to the European Parliament is truly unfair and undemocratic compared to the law on elections to the national parliament."
"The forfeiture of a seat of a deputy to the European Parliament by laws of eligibility is an easy way to put pressure on political opponents and gives the opportunity to settle an account politically with those who have more authority."
"Unfortunately, although being in the European Union, the law is still abused in many former Communist countries."
"This is the case for Mr Tomczak as well."
"As Members of the European Parliament, Polish MEPs represent not only the Poles but also all Europeans."
"It is unacceptable that these people's representatives are discriminated against by maintaining different legislation with regard to Members of the Polish Parliament."
"A Polish MEP, if convicted, will be punished not only by Polish law but will also lose his seat as a Member of the European Parliament."
"That fact clearly shows the discrimination of Polish Members of the European Parliament in comparison to members of national parliaments."
"That situation is unacceptable and shows clearly how unjust and unfair the Polish electoral law is."
"May I urge Poland to change its electoral law?"
"Mr President, this oral question is a consequence of the debates in the Committee on Legal Affairs on the immunity of Mr Tomczak."
"The immunity of Mr Tomczak was raised by Parliament a few years ago."
"Recently the Committee on Legal Affairs received a request from Mr Tomczak to defend his immunity."
"The committee discussed this request and a draft decision has been prepared."
"Nevertheless, the adoption of the final decision was postponed as the committee received information that, in the event of his immunity being waived, the legal consequences for Members of the European Parliament from Poland and Members of the Polish Parliament would be different."
"According to the Polish Act of 23 January 2004, a Member of the European Parliament from Poland will lose his or her seat automatically in the event of criminal conviction."
"For Members of the Polish Parliament this provision is not applicable."
"Such a difference is in breach of European Community law, by maintaining different legislation with regard to members of the national parliament and Polish Members of the European Parliament."
"This discrepancy between Polish and European Community laws needs to be clarified."
"Therefore, I fully support the formulation of an oral question to the Commission."
"I hope Mr Frattini will use all his influence to aim to eliminate this discrepancy between Polish and European Community laws."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that democracy in Europe needs to be constantly developed, and we are seeing many attacks on our democratic system from outside Europe."
"The Members of the European Parliament take decisions, of course, on very many issues that have a direct and immediate effect on the European public."
"Members of parliaments do not take decisions for themselves but represent their voters."
"For this reason the Members of the European Parliament must not be inferior in status to members of national parliaments nor, conversely, should national deputies have a lesser status than MEPs."
"For this reason I believe that the Commission should examine the impact on Poland's MEPs of the new statute that will apply from 2009 onwards and investigate what changes the statute will make and whether there is not some scope for its principles to be applied in order to remove these disparities."
"(ES) Mr President, as ever, Commissioner Frattini has performed an intricate legal analysis."
"As he said, in the current circumstances there would appear to be no grounds for bringing proceedings before the Court of Justice directly."
"However, after listening to Mr Zwiefka, who has been telling us about a proposal from the current Polish Government to amend the law, I would ask the Commissioner whether he believes that the Commission could in fact approach the Polish Government on the basis of the debate we are having in Parliament at present to see whether the Polish Government is indeed proposing to amend the law to harmonise the status of MEPs with that of members of the national parliament."
"(PL) Mr President, the proposal put forward by Mr Zwiefka to make the situation of Members of the European Parliament the same as Members of the Parliament in Poland does not provide a solution to the problem."
"I believe that the best solution, which is in fact already part of Polish law, would be that in circumstances where a person is convicted of a deliberate crime, the court should also decide to deprive them of public rights, meaning that the person in question cannot stand for election."
"This solution exists, for example, in France."
"I would like to give you a specific example: our colleague, Mr Onesta, the Vice-President of the European Parliament, was sentenced a few months ago by a court in France to a suspended sentence of several months for an act that, under Polish law, would automatically mean the loss of one's mandate to the European Parliament."
"I see the present situation as being completely wrong."
"I think we should go in the direction of the solution proposed by Mr Frattini."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some further brief comments: I am pleased that the debate overall has recognised that there is a significant and thorny problem."
"I should like, in particular, to thank Commissioner Frattini who, as the good lawyer that he is, has looked in more detail at the matter, which, as he rightly says, does not just relate to Poland."
"There is a general principle at stake and I am therefore very content, as is the Committee, that you are undertaking an overall review to monitor compliance and to check whether laws are consistent as regards the national and the European question."
"One fact is certain, however, there is not an apparent conflict since, as regards guarantees, the Polish law is contrary to the Treaty; if a Polish MEP were to lose his seat, obviously the article of the treaty which provides for the possibility of taking part in the sessions would fall."
"From the Committee's own point of view, as you have heard in the debate just now from Mr Medina, and from me personally, the issue is not one of bringing proceedings, but of following up the question in order to resolve it."
"If our Polish colleague, Mr Zwiefka, says that this matter has already been brought to the fore in Poland, some progress has already been made."
"Comparability is what is needed, as that comparability makes Europe the guarantor of the unity of States that are working together, of citizenship and of equal rights from the point of view of freedom and everyone's status."
"(PL) Mr President, just to add my support to the speeches, most of which I support, I believe that of course we should harmonise our regulations as soon as possible."
"To illustrate how necessary this, is I would like to draw attention to the story of our colleague, an MEP, who is present here with us: Mr Tomczak, who has been involved in a criminal case in Poland for many years, which is now approaching a conclusion and could impact on his future as a Member of the European Parliament."
"A case which does not involve much harm, and in which witnesses deny that the event took place."
"A case that at one time was closed, which perhaps under the influence of some political turbulence has been reopened; and now, Mr Tomczak, who has twice been elected (our colleague became an MP in 2005, and an MEP in 2004), now, his immunity as well as his mandate may be removed."
"This is something that is unbelievable, harmful and which should, as quickly as possible, be cut short and removed from this forum."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that tonight's debate has shown two things: the first is that there is a widespread view, which is shared, I would say, by all those who have spoken - and a view which I believe to be right - that the disparity of treatment between MEPs elected in Poland and Polish national MPs should be removed and that this analysis should be extended to all the other new Member States of the European Union whose compliance with the European Act of 1976 has not as yet been checked."
"The second conclusion, and I refer to the proposal by Mr Medina Ortega, with which I agree, is to pass on the outcome of this debate to the competent authorities of the Polish Government, informing them that this disparity of treatment needs to be removed through national legislation."
"I shall do that."
"I can tell you that I shall certainly make formal contact with the Minister of Justice of the Polish Government in order to pass on the widespread opinion of this House - which I share - that while the Polish national legislator has sovereign powers over the way in which the elimination of this disparity of treatment is to be achieved, the objective of removing that disparity of treatment must be pursued."
"That is the opinion that I put forward at the beginning: I do not consider that I can tell the Polish legislator how to proceed, but I do consider that I can spell out the objective, and that objective is to remove the disparity of treatment between the status of Polish national MPs and the status of MEPs elected in Poland."
"I shall certainly pass on that information and I would add that I shall report back to this House, in view of the interest of Mr Gargani and the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the review of the other 11 new Member States so that the governments of other Member States that might be affected can then be notified accordingly."
"The debate is closed."
"Explanations of vote"
"The next item is clarification on the voting method."
"(DE) Mr President, may I ask that the temperature in the chamber be set at a humane level."
"At times it is so cold in here that we almost need to put on our coats."
"I ask the administration to ensure that we have a decent temperature in which to work."
"Thank you."
"I would ask the staff responsible for the heating in the chamber to increase the temperature."
"It might go up anyway during this item of discussion."
"Oral clarification concerning voting"
"- (CS) Mr Chairman, I welcome the fact that we gave the green light to the modern framework for further development of the automotive industry in Europe."
"I am pleased that we have voted for objectives that are realistic and that make provision for the increase in the price of oil and for our great ambitions regarding safety and protection of the environment."
"The objectives do not hinder Europe's ability to compete."
"Increasing requirements for safer and safer car designs and for more efficient engines that should emit one third less greenhouse gases are all objectives that already imply an increase in prices as well as an increase in the running costs of cars."
"We are aware that these requirements in themselves are not the main motivation for the middle classes and for the less affluent to change their cars more frequently."
"The elimination of old cars from the European roads is therefore the basic requirement if the CARS 21 is to prove its worth."
"The key is to change consumer motivation."
"Taxes and fiscal policies are not, however, entrusted to the European Union."
"It will therefore be up to the Member States to carry the responsibility for setting the parameters."
"It will be up to the Member States to determine whether and when safer and more environmentally-friendly cars will start taking the place of the old cars on our roads."
"That would also be real proof of the effectiveness of CARS 21."
"Written clarification concerning voting"
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my Polish colleague Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, asking Parliament to approve the amendment to the Council Regulation of 2004 on the establishment of partnerships in the framework of the stabilisation and association process."
"The change entails renaming the partnership with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: instead of a 'European partnership' it is to be called an 'accession partnership' in order to align this with the name of the Partnerships with the two other candidate countries, Croatia and Turkey."
"In addition, Montenegro's independence had to be taken into account."
"As I compose this question, I am also thinking of Kosovo, in the hope that we may find a peaceful, European solution to the difficult situation there."
"in writing. - (NL) In December 2005 the Council granted the status of candidate country to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and in June 2006 Montenegro was recognised as an independent state."
"In an urgent procedure without debate, it is now proposed in Article 1 of the Regulation that Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia, including Kosovo, be granted a European Partnership and in Article 1(a) that Croatia and Macedonia be granted an Accession Partnership."
"The definitions of those two arrangements are more or less the same."
"The rapporteur supports the Commission proposal and asks the Council to consult Parliament again if it intends to depart from that proposal."
"It seems to me a real possibility that it will depart from it."
"It is not specified how account is to be taken of the anticipated recognition of Kosovo as an independent state in the next few weeks."
"It is also not clear whether that means that Macedonia will have to wait longer for the start of accession negotiations, or whether Serbia is being offered the prospect of accession as a priority."
"It is well known that the Netherlands and Belgium are opposed to that for as long as the war criminal Ratko Mladić has not been handed over to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague."
"I therefore expect that point to be put back on the agenda, but am not voting against the report."
"in writing. - (PL) I would like to vote in favour of the report of Mr Liberadzki on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 95/50/EC as regards the implementing powers conferred on the Commission."
"Mr Liberadzki has prepared an excellent report."
"I agree with the rapporteur, who is in favour of the Commission's proposal, and would also recommend that the proposal should be approved without amendments."
"Directive 95/50/EC sets out procedures for checks carried out by Member States as regards the transport of dangerous goods by road."
"For the purpose of these checks a list of infringements has been proposed, in respect of which vehicles may be immobilised and required to be brought into conformity before continuing their journey."
"In addition, it is important that each Member State send a report on the application of the Directive for each calendar year."
"in writing. - (DE) Tolls imposed on heavy goods vehicles, supposedly introduced in order to shift traffic from road to rail, have predictably failed to make rail transport more appealing but have been offloaded onto consumers."
"Particularly on the busiest routes and in large conurbations, the focus on road transport will exacerbate existing problems such as congestion, noise, environmental pollution and particulate concentrations."
"Another cause for concern is the cavalier manner in which some transport operations are carried out."
"Weekly targeted spot checks on lorries in Austria have greatly improved the safety of road haulage operations and should accordingly become standard practice throughout the EU."
"If the European Union cares about the health of its population and protection of the environment, it must waste no time at all in ensuring that major pollution sources such as commercial utility vehicles with ageing diesel engines are replaced, that piggyback rail services are made economically attractive and that the Alpine Convention is implemented."
"in writing. - (PL) The rapporteur, Paolo Costa, has shown how discrimination in transport rates and conditions can be abolished."
"It is true that one can quickly achieve significant benefits by introducing just a few changes into existing legislation."
"As a shadow rapporteur I would like to note that a common approach was reached by the Council, the Commission and the Parliament."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on airport charges, following the report of my German colleague Ulrich Stockmann."
"At the point when European airports, which are mainly publicly owned, are being privatised, when users do not always wholly appreciate their consumption of services, and when companies are developing in a context involving many variables, it was quite natural to regulate the determination of airport charges."
"I welcome the creation of independent national regulatory authorities to supervise this market, and I hope that European coordination will be rapidly established and that, in due course, an independent European regulator will come into being."
"in writing. - (SV) The Commission proposals contain a long list of detailed rules on how airport charges should be collected."
"It is one of the Commission's responsibilities to monitor compliance with Community competition legislation."
"The proposals in question, however, mean excessive bureaucracy and detailed regulation, which is disadvantageous to those Member States which have chosen to deregulate the aviation sector."
"The European Parliament considers that the common principles on airport charges should only apply to airports with over five million passenger movements per year, or to those at which annual traffic amounts to over 15% of the number of passenger movements in the Member State in question."
"This position is preferable to the Commission proposal, which also includes smaller regional airports."
"We are often called upon to decide whether to support common EU rules aimed at ensuring equal treatment of all interests participating in the internal market."
"In this case it is clear that the Commission's line involves unjustified bureaucracy."
"On the basis of these arguments, we have voted in favour of the proposal of the European Parliament, but against the legislative resolution in the final vote."
"in writing. - (PT) Although it includes some points that improve the Commission proposal, the report continues to reflect and is an integral part of the process of air transport deregulation in the EU."
"An improvement in transparency in the method of calculating airport charges is certainly to be welcomed."
"However, we disagree with a policy that seeks to deregulate and privatise a strategic public service such as air transport, in this case promoting 'a truly competitive airport market', or the incorporation of principles such as the 'user pays' and profitability in a service that should be public."
"What is more, efforts are even being made to remove its 'regulatory role' from the public arena, creating 'independent regulatory authorities' to that end."
"The privatisations that have taken place in the sector have not added value to the services provided and have caused job losses and a deterioration in workers' rights, and in some cases technical and operational problems."
"We regret that our proposals have been rejected."
"They sought to ensure that the directive included recognition of the constraints faced by regions that suffer permanent geographic and natural disadvantages, such as the outermost regions, and therefore established appropriate exceptions for fulfilling universal public service obligations."
"in writing. - British Conservatives are very much in favour of larger airports being subject to extra scrutiny where they hold a dominant market position."
"However, we already have a strong regulatory system in the United Kingdom and we therefore feel that this is an unnecessary interference which could have an adverse effect on regional airports, which have a vital impact on local economies."
"We have tried to improve the measure in order to maintain an 'opt out' on a national basis or at least to lift the threshold so that most regional airports are excluded, and although these attempts have not yet been successful, we will return to them at Second Reading."
"In the meantime we will reserve our position."
"in writing. - (DE) I did not vote for this report on the Airport Charges Directive, because what is being proposed here amounts to unacceptable discrimination against Luxembourg Airport."
"This is no way to treat a small country."
"The application of the directive to Luxembourg Airport, with its 1.6 million passengers a year, and the fact that its provisions do not apply to either of Luxembourg's direct competitors, Frankfurt Hahn and Brussels Charleroi, which process more than three million passengers, is intolerable discrimination in a single market and is based solely on the fact that a national border lies between Luxembourg and these other airports."
"The key factor in this directive must not be national borders but objective criteria if its purpose is to ensure that no airport abuses a dominant market position."
"Smaller airports, even if they are the only air terminal in their country, do not run the risk of perpetrating such abuse, especially in the case of Luxembourg, where the aforementioned rival airports lie within easy reach and, moreover, are used by budget airlines."
"Luxembourg is so small that three different countries lie less than half an hour away from the airport by car."
"This proposal is an imposed infringement of the proportionality principle which cannot be accepted as it stands."
"That is why I am voting against the proposal by way of protest."
"in writing. - I welcome the report and what it seeks to achieve."
"Through the introduction of greater transparency in the way airport charges are calculated I feel it creates a level playing field and stimulates competition in the sector."
"The plans will help Scotland's airports in competing with its British counterparts, especially by reducing the dominant position occupied by major travel hubs like London."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say, as a Member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, that I am in favour of the Stockmann report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on airport charges."
"I consider it advisable, however, to make some comments in particular as regards the link between airport charges and the costs of the services offered."
"In this respect, the delegations from France and the Netherlands, with Italian support, called for a clear reference to costs."
"It should be noted here that Italian domestic law makes provision for a specific relationship between the costs of the services supplied and the charges levied by the managing body."
"The provision of paragraph 5 makes the Italian system more consistent with the scheme of the directive, enabling current procedures to be maintained, provided that the independent regulatory body provided for in Article 10, which monitors the correct application of the charges, and the body which approves charging levels nationally are combined into the same authority."
"That body, it has to be stressed, will have to be independent from both managing bodies and airline companies."
"in writing. - While this report has a number of good ideas on making airport charges more transparent and bringing environmental considerations into the calculation for the first time, we must, as ever, be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath water."
"In my constituency, Scotland, we have dozens of small airports, and air travel is not a luxury - it is a necessity serving fragile communities."
"I have therefore supported amendments to exempt airports in the outermost regions from the new regime, and look forward to the production of a framework that takes account of the fragile nature of many communities."
"in writing. - (SV) The big air transport companies have pressed for a specific EU arrangement to regulate the collection of airport charges by airports."
"They think that the airports are local monopolies and exploit their monopoly position in order to impose unreasonable charges."
"The Swedish air transport agency LFV and the smaller air transport companies, however, have misgivings with regard to new legislation."
"For the smaller air transport companies new legislation and harmonisation are more of a threat, since they often choose to fly to competing airports which apply lower charges."
"I have voted against the directive for several reasons."
"Airports are already regulated by national authorities, and their action is limited by existing competition legislation in the EU."
"Those countries which choose a business model that leads to higher airport charges resulting, for example, from investment or transfer of ownership must be allowed to do so as long as the charges are not contrary to existing legislation."
"It is then up to the Member States to judge whether their charges are competitive or not."
"The European Parliament has reduced the scope of the directive."
"Along with others, I voted for the amendments limiting the directive to 67 airports (compared to around 150 which would have been affected before)."
"However, I cannot support price regulation at EU level."
"in writing. - (FR) In the first reading in the codecision procedure, I voted in favour of a legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation on the export and import of dangerous chemicals, based on the report by my Dutch colleague Johannes Blokland."
"I am delighted that a compromise has been found, since there is a fairly urgent need to regularise the legal situation ensuing from the annulment by the Court of Justice of the previous Regulation dating from 2003, while at the same time improving the regulatory situation to take account of developments since that time."
"in writing. - I have voted in favour of the compromise amendments agreed by the vast majority of the political groups, which are intended to promote joint responsibility between parties with regard to international trade in hazardous chemicals."
"Rules adopted at EU level are vital for the provision of a high level of protection of the environment and public health, and we aspire to these rules being extended internationally."
"Awareness of risks is paramount for exporters and importers."
"Countries, by virtue of exchange of information and best practice and compulsory national decision-making on the acceptability of chemicals, can heighten such awareness while also making legislators and stakeholders aware of such risks."
"The proposed legislation implements the Rotterdam Convention, the underlying principle being to help participating countries learn more about the characteristics of potentially hazardous chemicals and pesticides."
"This provides countries with the information and the means to stop unwanted imports of toxic chemicals, putting the requirement and onus on the exporter/exporting country to comply with the laws of the importing country."
"I very much welcome and support this legislation and the European Parliament's compromise package."
"in writing. - (IT) I welcome the implementation of the Rotterdam Convention, as it shows that Europe is well aware of its commitments to protect the environment and health of third countries and, in particular, developing countries."
"From today it will no longer be possible to export hazardous chemical products to countries outside Europe without prior authorisation from the countries of destination (the so-called PIC - prior informed consent procedure)."
"We had to put an end to the double standard that existed when a substance was strictly regulated in the European market to protect the environment and the health of European citizens, but could be freely traded with third countries without any precautions or any obligation to provide information on risks."
"A measure of courtesy and solidarity especially towards countries with fewer information and risk analysis resources than the European Union."
"in writing. - (PT) The Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade was approved in September 1998 and entered into force on 24 February 2004."
"Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals implements the Rotterdam Convention."
"The Commission considered it necessary to bring an action against the Council and the European Parliament at the Court of Justice because it did not agree with the change in the legal basis (environment rather than common commercial policy)."
"In its Judgment of 10 January 2006, the Court of Justice annulled the Regulation on the grounds that there should have been a dual legal basis including both Article 133 and Article 175(1) of the Treaty, and ruled that the effects of the Regulation would be maintained until a new regulation founded on appropriate legal bases was adopted."
"The European Commission submitted a new draft regulation based on the above-mentioned dual legal basis."
"In today's vote, at first reading, the European Parliament approved a range of amendments to the European Commission proposal that will now be negotiated with the Council."
"Hence our vote in favour."
"in writing. - (FR) I welcome the agreement reached on this Regulation at first reading."
"There are 75 000 different chemical products on the market and 1 500 new ones are added to that every year."
"So it is difficult for governments to monitor and manage all the potentially dangerous substances that cross our borders on a daily basis."
"The Regulation will help to ensure that these dangerous chemical products are used in a more rational way, by facilitating the exchange of information about them."
"Importing countries will thus be properly equipped and informed so that they can identify potential threats and keep out those chemical products that they are not in a position to manage safely."
"We do have to recognise the difficulties that exporting countries sometimes face in seeking to obtain explicit consent from the importing countries."
"However, derogations granted to exporting countries awaiting consent may no longer be valid for more than 12 months."
"I am pleased that we have adopted this measure, which aims to prevent uncontrolled imports of dangerous chemical products into third countries."
"The Regulation will enable us to avoid repetition of the many errors committed in the past, which have caused damage to the environment and to public health."
"in writing. - (PL) The rapporteur, Johannes Blokland, is right in noting that adequate rules should be adopted worldwide and at European level in order to provide a high level of protection for the environment and public health."
"The development of a specific infrastructure in less developed countries could certainly combat the irresponsible use of chemicals which would otherwise damage the ecology, economy and working conditions."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the report."
"I see the implementation of the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent (PIC) as a positive step in this policy area."
"Ensuring that prior consent is given from third countries receiving dangerous substances helps ensure that developing countries do not fall victim to the dumping of restricted chemicals in their backyard without their agreement."
"Though this is an encouraging move in the right direction, the implementation of the measures needs to be closely followed by the Commission."
"in writing. - (DE) Unscrupulous traders are trying to evade the special requirements that apply to the transport of chemicals and other hazardous goods, requirements such as specialised driver training, labelling and the like. Vans belonging to parcel services carry highly corrosive acids, explosive liquids or ammunition, often without the driver even knowing."
"If items are not labelled and waybills do not indicate the true nature of the goods, staff may be risking their lives in the event of an accident."
"A fire would have unimaginably dire consequences, not only in the form of permanent damage to health but possibly of environmental contamination too."
"It makes sense to simplify the requirements for the transport of dangerous goods without compromising safety."
"There is also a need to think about ways of speeding up the switchover to double-hull tankers in order to reduce the incidence of environmental disasters."
"Above all, however, more targeted spot checks on HGVs are needed throughout the EU so that the black sheep who drive with unsecured, unlabelled or dangerous loads, defective brakes, etc., can be taken off the road."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report by Johannes Blokland on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals."
"The report raises the issue of permitting transport without explicit authorisation."
"From the economic point of view, the existing situation is unsatisfactory for European exporters of chemicals if they do not receive any response from importing countries about substances listed in the Annexes."
"As a result of this regulation, European exporters of chemicals which are severely restricted in Europe can export these substances outside the European Union more easily."
"This more flexible approach could result, especially in less developed states, in countries no longer enjoying any protection against imports of chemical substances."
"In order to avoid the uncontrolled export of hazardous substances to third countries, and in order to protect those countries that are less able or even unable to assess hazardous chemicals, the period of tacit agreement should be shorter."
"It is important that the Commission's proposal should apply to the issue of introducing tools making it easier for customs authorities to carry out the provisions of the Regulation."
"For the mechanisms proposed in this new regulation to function correctly and effectively it is vital to have close cooperation between customs authorities and selected national authorities."
"The introduction of the new regulations should be preceded by drawing up guidelines concerning the use of computer products and documentation and providing training in accordance with EU standards, particularly for the new Member States."
"in writing. - (FR) In the first reading in the codecision procedure, I voted in favour of the legislative resolution amending the proposal of the European Commission amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community, on the basis of the report by my excellent Hungarian colleague Csaba Őry, which introduces technical amendments to the European Commission's proposal with a view to making the Regulation clearer or easier to read."
"He is pleased that this Regulation sets out to give an accurate impression of the evolution in the legal situation of national social security schemes, and hence to ensure appropriate coordination at Community level."
"in writing. - (PL) With reference to the principle of the four basic freedoms in European economic integration, I would also like to draw attention to the meaning of Regulation 1408/71, which aims to promote the free movement of workers in the European Union."
"Whilst it is true that the report in question relates to strictly technical issues, these very issues, in serving to update the above-mentioned Regulation by making it take into account social insurance changes at national level, have a direct impact on the everyday life of citizens who are travelling, working or living in another Member State."
"I would also agree with the rapporteur that, when implementing the principle of free movement in Europe, social conditions should be set out in a precise manner."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise how important the proposed changes and the transparency of the guidelines are for thousands of Polish citizens who are living and working outside of Poland."
"This is one of the principal reasons why I support Mr Őry's report."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr Őry is right in acknowledging that, on the level of the European Union, effective coordination needs to be ensured between Member States as regards benefit payments."
"This Regulation, by introducing updates that take into account the latest changes in certain Member States, holds out the possibility of guaranteeing to citizens who are travelling from one Member State to another the possibility of benefiting from social insurance."
"in writing. - (FR) On the basis of the own-initiative report of my German friend and colleague Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, I voted in favour of the Resolution on a Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework, following the Communication from the European Commission based on the 'CARS 21' high-level group."
"I should like to begin by welcoming the method involving the holding of a genuine industrial audit with all the stakeholders, with a view to specifying an industrial policy for the automotive sector involving parameters as important as not only the impact on purchasing power, employment, safety, mobility, the environment and the regulatory burdens the industry has to shoulder, but also innovation, competitiveness, the problems of second-hand cars, disposing of old cars, etc., in an internal market which is far from complete."
"It is essential that, having created the internal market in the interests of consumers, the European Union should devote particular attention to manufacturers, implementing a European industrial policy with them."
"The automotive sector, in which we have a great tradition, must be given support as it undergoes the major changes taking place today."
"in writing. - While I do not disagree that it may be desirable to reduce CO2 emissions in an overall environmental context, it is not for the undemocratic EU to decide these issues."
"in writing. - (PT) The European automotive industry, which represents around 3% of the EU's GDP and 7% of its manufacturing output, is one of the most important economic sectors, producing around one third of global production."
"It is also one of the EU's leading export sectors and invests 4% of its turnover in R&D. The sector is one of the largest employers, with over 2 million direct and 10 million indirect jobs, and is therefore a key factor in Europe's economic, social and cultural life."
"The sector is facing serious challenges, however."
"Rapid technological progress, coupled with fierce international competition, means that it must change rapidly."
"Furthermore, considerable social expectations weigh upon the sector, particularly in terms of the environment and road safety."
"This close interaction between the industry, the environment, energy and transport makes it one of the EU's most regulated areas - it is covered by around 80 directives and 115 UNECE regulations."
"We cannot support all the proposals presented in this report, however."
"Too much emphasis is given to defending the internal market and competition, while little attention is paid to social and labour issues and the development gap between Member States."
"in writing. - (FR) The Chatzimarkakis report is supposed to be about the main factors that will make the automotive industry competitive in the years ahead, taking account of environmental constraints, product and safety standards, competitors in the international context, etc."
"Yet, threaded throughout the text we find evidence of the ongoing urge to persecute drivers."
"Surely curbing traffic in urban areas and the cross-border enforcement of fines for infringement of traffic rules have no place in such a report?"
"Are Europeans now to be required, on pain of sanctions or higher taxes, to buy 'clean' vehicles fitted with expensive safety-related technologies, while the reality in a country like France is that the high average age of cars on the road (eight years) is a reflection of people's financial difficulties and low purchasing power?"
"Why are private cars yet again castigated, when they are responsible, in France for example, for just 13% of CO2 emissions, and that figure is certainly lower in countries that do not use nuclear energy?"
"There is a basic paradox here in seeking to have a competitive automotive industry in Europe, when the overall thrust of European policies is to push up the price of cars and to impoverish consumers, while at the same time introducing new forms of persecution to dissuade people from buying and using vehicles."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report proposing a competitive automotive regulatory framework."
"It is a road map for making cars cleaner and safer and for simplifying the legal context for the development of European vehicle manufacturing."
"We must make it possible to reduce the impact of road transport on air quality as vehicles currently in use are gradually replaced."
"I welcome the adoption of the deadlines that Parliament has set, coinciding with the date of 2015, to achieve an emissions limit of 125 g/km for new cars coming onto the market."
"The date is the same as that for the entry into force of the Euro VI standards."
"Additional measures (involving alternative fuels, eco-driving or tax incentives, for example) could contribute to this effort, and particular attention should be paid to biofuels and hydrogen."
"CARS 21 recommends a holistic approach to road safety, involving vehicle technology, infrastructure and road users (suggested measures include electronic stability control, seat-belt reminders and emergency braking systems)."
"The first requirement of effective legislation is that it should be realistic, and environmental concerns have long been central to policies within the industry."
"in writing. - (NL) I have voted against the Chatzimarkakis report, because the Commission proposal is more environmentally friendly."
"The rapporteur suggests a target of 125 g/km of CO2 in 2015."
"The Commission proposal suggests a maximum emission of 120 g/km of CO2 in 2012."
"I tabled an amendment to have that withdrawn, but it just failed to go through."
"I wonder where the rapporteur has got the less environmentally favourable proposal from without being influenced by the motor industry lobby."
"For years now there have been voluntary agreements between the Commission and the motor industry to reduce CO2 emissions."
"The Commission target does not just come from nowhere and it is, according to the motor industry, technically achievable and from an innovative point of view an export product."
"They will, however, make less profit temporarily in order to be able to stabilise their competitive position in the future."
"It is wrongly argued that jobs will be lost."
"I might point out that only 6% of the production costs of new cars are staff costs."
"The choice of labour cost savings is separate from the shift to 120 g/km of CO2 in 2012."
"If the motor industry decides to move its operations to low-wage countries, it will do that anyway."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the report."
"I strongly believe that the CO2 target of 120g/km by 2012 is one that must be met and is essential in fighting climate change."
"Though I acknowledge that Member States need to engage in the funding of research and development for the automobile sector in this area, I feel that the industry itself should also contribute and demonstrate a further commitment to reducing the effects of climate change."
"I also approve of the directive calling for the information and consultation of workers on this issue."
"in writing. - (NL) Together with my colleague, Mrs Liotard, I voted against the Chatzimarkakis report, because the original Commission proposal is more environmentally friendly."
"The rapporteur sets a target of 125 g/km of CO2 in 2015."
"In the Commission proposal, the maximum emission was 120 g/km of CO2 in 2012."
"My group tabled an amendment today for that to be withdrawn, but it just failed to go through."
"I wonder where the rapporteur got this less environmentally favourable proposal from, if it is not influenced by the motor industry lobby."
"For years now there have been voluntary agreements between the Commission and the motor industry to reduce CO2 emissions."
"The Commission target does not just come from nowhere."
"According to the motor industry, it is technically achievable and can generate an innovative export product."
"Certainly car factories will temporarily make less profit, which they see as interference with the strengthening of their competitive position."
"It is wrongly argued that jobs might be lost."
"Only 6% of the production costs of new cars are staff costs."
"Any lower labour costs are separate from the shift to 120 g/km of CO2 in 2012."
"If the motor industry wants to decide to move its operations to low-wage countries, a less strict rule will not prevent it."
"in writing. - (PT) The future of the competitiveness of the European automotive sector is extremely important."
"The EU should therefore continue to adopt a long-term approach based on investing in research and development and improving the operation of the internal market by means of the necessary legislation and by simplifying administrative procedures, making them quicker and less costly."
"The report suggests that an integrated environmental approach should be adopted, allied to new engine technologies and the use of less polluting fuels, and that additional measures should be taken in the area of traffic management, driving behaviour and infrastructure so that greenhouse gas emissions are reduced even further."
"I consider these aspects to be essential, and the investment required should be funded largely through public-private partnerships as a new tool for industrial research and technological development."
"Finally, the international dimension highlights the need for urgent measures to be taken to improve access to markets, particularly in Asia, by means of multilateral negotiations and bilateral trade agreements."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report on the CARS 21 initiative."
"in writing. - I will be voting in favour of the Chatzimarkakis report, even though I believe that the car industry has to do more to reduce emissions from the vehicles it produces."
"It is very easy on the one hand to pick out the motor car as the chief sinner in all things environmental, and certainly the motor car that we have at the moment leaves a lot to be desired in this area."
"But we must work with industry and educate them on the need to produce more environmentally-friendly cars."
"The motor industry is a big employer of people and contributes considerably to local, regional and national economies."
"It therefore cannot be treated in a cavalier way, as some Members of this House believe."
"One area that concerns me is in this report is the clear view that fiscal measures, and fiscal harmonisation, should be used as a way of promoting the Car 21 concept."
"For me, this is a move too far, and the one area I cannot support."
"However, I welcome this report and support it because overall it adopts a balanced and practical approach."
"in writing. - (DE) The report entitled CARS 21: A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework has my full support."
"This report can help to enhance the competitiveness of the car industry."
"Besides imposing new obligations on the industry in the form of environmental requirements, we also need to give it simplified procedures, to cut red tape and to apply the principles of better lawmaking."
"In addition, the automotive sector must benefit from more research and development funding."
"With regard to the achievement of the target CO2 values, it is important that we base the phased reductions on the parameter of vehicle weight rather than the 'carbon footprint'."
"The only physical correlation that exists is between the weight of a vehicle and its CO2 emissions."
"The carbon footprint does not offer this kind of correlation, and its use would only serve to put the German car industry at a competitive disadvantage."
"We have come out emphatically in favour of an integrated strategy that takes account of all possible means of reducing CO2 emissions."
"We want factors such as individual driver behaviour, the creation of various incentives to drive environmentally clean cars, the use of biofuels and the promotion of new forms of vehicle technology to contribute to the reduction of emission levels."
"This poses a challenge not only to car manufacturers but to all stakeholders."
"in writing. - I voted against the Chatzimarkakis report, because the Commission proposal is more environmentally friendly."
"The rapporteur sets as target 125 grams of CO2 per km in 2015."
"The Commission proposal suggests a maximum emission target of 120 grams of CO2 in 2012, which was retabled as an amendment."
"This amendment has regrettably been dismissed."
"I wonder from where the rapporteur got the proposal, which is environmentally and technically inferior, without having been influenced by the car industry lobby."
"For years there have been voluntary agreements between the Commission and the car industry to limit the CO2 emissions."
"The Commission target does not come out of the blue and is, according to the car industry, technically feasible and, innovatively speaking, an export product."
"They will, however, temporarily be making a lesser profit in order to stabilise their competition position in the future."
"There is unjustified use of the issue of loss of employability."
"I point out the fact that only 6% of the production costs of new cars are personnel costs."
"The choice of cost-cutting on labour is unrelated to the move to 120 grams of CO2 per km in 2012."
"Should the car industry decide to move to low wage countries, they will do this nonetheless."
"in writing. - (NL) The transport sector accounts for one fifth of greenhouse gases."
"Sustainable, efficient and clean cars can make a serious contribution in the fight against climate change."
"Efforts to achieve that can make the motor industry considerably stronger in the future."
"Unfortunately there is no sign of that message in the response to the CARS 21 document by the Commission and Parliament."
"In our amendments, we have tried to note a number of core points."
"Individual mobility and the motor industry need to be looked at in the broader context of sustainable mobility."
"We emphasise that the escalating worldwide demand for transport fuels can lead to the exploitation of oil sources with serious adverse effects on the environment, such as tar sand and synthetic coal gas."
"Steps also have to be taken to improve fuel efficiency in the sector."
"The choice of biofuels can only be developed if the Commission establishes a binding comprehensive certification system with strict social and environmental criteria."
"Finally, we would also like to remove, firstly, the paragraphs suggesting that motor sport and Formula 1 racing can possibly contribute to more environmentally friendly technologies and, secondly, the paragraphs that allow manufacturers to produce vehicles that emit extra CO2 if those emissions result from legally binding measures at EU level."
"Most of our amendments have been rejected."
"I am therefore voting against this report."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on tax treatment of losses in cross-border situations, based on the own-initiative report by my excellent colleague Piia-Noora Kauppi in response to a communication from the European Commission on the same subject."
"I am very concerned about the unfavourable repercussions of the large number of regimes applied by the Member States to cross-border losses on the workings of the internal market."
"In the context of the recent decision of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the Marks & Spencer case, this is a particularly opportune time, since, in the absence of cross-border deduction of losses, compensation for these losses is generally limited to the profits realised in the Member State in which the investment was made."
"This distorts the decisions of undertakings within the internal market."
"It would seem to be essential to instigate direct coordination of Member States' tax systems within the internal market."
"However, this must be a temporary solution, since in the longer term we must adopt a common consolidated basis for taxation of companies that constitutes a global solution and eliminates the tax obstacles involved in cross-border compensation of losses and profits."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Kauppi Report because there is a need for continued detailed debate on the various contentious issues that arise in this report."
"It is necessary to ensure that different corporate tax regimes do not enable companies to evade their responsibilities to support society by a share of their profits through a fair corporate tax regime."
"However particular attention needs to be given to the negative impact that a CCCTB could have on small countries such as Ireland, whose prosperity and employment levels depend to a large extent on its capacity to attract foreign investment."
"in writing. - (PT) Unfortunately the amendments tabled by our Group were rejected, in particular certain positions contrary to those that were finally approved."
"This included the opinion on the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in the Marks & Spencer case, which constitutes excessive interference in the right of Member States not to have their tax systems weakened."
"In cross-border situations fiscal competence must be fairly distributed between the Member States concerned, avoiding the double offsetting of losses and risks of tax evasion."
"There is also considered to be a risk that, by allowing cross-border losses to be offset, companies tend to ensure that their profits are taxed in low-tax rather than high-tax countries."
"The possibility of offsetting cross-border losses can thus only be justified when parts of the same enterprise are genuinely interlinked, or, in other words, when those parts are economically and organisationally integrated."
"Above all, the conditions for appropriate and equal tax treatment which avoids tax evasion and which also ensures that public services function and that income is apportioned and distributed more fairly must be safeguarded."
"in writing. - (SV) The internal market is the EU's greatest contribution to democracy and prosperity in Europe."
"The intention of this report is said to be to make the internal market work better by bringing about the harmonisation of tax bases, in this case by the harmonisation of ways in which company losses are to be treated when several countries are affected."
"However, the report rests upon a premise which has not been thought through."
"Harmonisation of tax bases has very different effects in the different countries depending on differences in the structure of their industries."
"In some countries there is a preponderance of heavy primary industry with huge long-range investments, whereas in others industry is dominated by service businesses and light engineering."
"We therefore consider that the question of harmonising tax bases should be investigated more thoroughly before a report such as this is debated in Parliament."
"in writing. - (PL) Ladies and gentlemen, taxes must be one of the most sensitive EU topics."
"Whenever discussions on this subject take place in international fora, there is a chorus of critical voices, chiefly because Member States jealously guard their right to set taxes."
"In the discussions concerning Mrs Kauppi's report on Tax Treatment of Losses in Cross-Border Situations, the issue of taxes was thoroughly analysed."
"The report draws attention to the major problems associated with branches of companies that benefit from different tax systems, frequently within the framework of a single company, but in different countries."
"There is no doubt that the European Union needs competitive tax regulation."
"This does not at all mean harmonised, but competitive."
"This means regulations that do not create an excessive burden but, on the contrary, will provide an incentive to start a business."
"I believe that the European Union should definitely not think about the harmonisation of taxes on legal persons, but it should coordinate taxes on the EU level so as to create real benefits as a result of tax competitiveness."
"I am very pleased that the rapporteur puts forward the same view in the report that has been presented."
"in writing. - In my view the tackling of the obstacles apparent in cross-border trade does not lie in harmonisation of taxation, which should fall under the remit of individual national legislatures."
"I therefore, abstained from the vote on this issue."
"in writing. - Mr President, sometimes I do wonder if the effort we put into reports in this place is worth it."
"Taxation policy must remain a competence of member states and any moves from anywhere to extend Community competence to this policy field will be met with opposition by our constituents, national governments and businesses."
"Accordingly, while I do not denigrate the hard work that has clearly gone into it, I disagree with much of this report and even question the need for it."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats welcome the Community strategy on health and safety at work and have therefore voted for the report."
"It is important that targets now be set for the number of labour inspectors in Europe."
"According to ILO recommendations the number of inspectors should be one per 10 000 employees."
"It is to be deplored, however, that following cuts imposed by the Government Sweden no longer meets the requirements laid down by the ILO and now the European Parliament."
"After the Government's savings Sweden will only have 0.7 inspector per 10 000 employees."
"Compare this with Denmark, for example, where the figure is a least two."
"in writing. - (FR) On the basis of the report by my British colleague Glenis Willmott, I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the Community strategy on health and safety at work 2007-2012, in response to the Communication from the European Commission on this subject."
"Every year, almost 500 000 people die or suffer permanent disability for work-related reasons, and we must applaud the European Commission's goal of achieving an average 25% reduction in work-related accidents in the EU."
"I support the idea of increased activity by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao (Spain)."
"In this matter and, more generally, in the development of social Europe, I regret the fact that neither the report nor, moreover, the Communication from the European Commission stresses that it is essential to support the social partners; we must always remember that under the existing Treaties, with Articles 137 ff. of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC), and this has been confirmed by the Lisbon Treaty that is in the process of being ratified, legislative instruments are available to the latter to facilitate the development of European social law."
"in writing. - This is a non-legislative report which has undergone substantial revision in committee as a direct result of our input."
"As a result, there should be no automatic need to divide on party-political lines, though we have tabled a few additional amendments for the plenary session."
"In its raw original form, it called for more prescriptive EU legislation in many areas."
"It now welcomes the Commission's greater emphasis on regulatory simplification and the reduction of administrative burdens, and the strong focus on helping SMEs."
"It recognises the prime role of Member States in promoting the health and safety agenda."
"We are proud of the role that we have played in significantly softening the original approach to make the report acceptable."
"Safeguarding the health and safety of workers is a concern for us all."
"in writing. - (PT) The report approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs covers significant aspects of the struggle for better living and working conditions, with greater protection of health and safety."
"Unfortunately, however, on the PPE's initiative, several proposals were amended and paragraph 59, which stressed that permanent employment is an important contributory factor to health and safety at work, was rejected."
"Hence our final vote to abstain."
"Concerned that the number of accidents and illnesses at work is not falling uniformly, since their incidence is much greater than the EU average among particular categories of workers (migrants, people on insecure contracts, women, the young and the elderly, for example) and particular Member States, the European Parliament calls upon the Commission to give priority to activities and/or sectors that involve particular risks."
"However, we welcome the approval of the paragraph that considers excessive working hours and insufficient rest periods to be a key factor in increased levels of accidents and illnesses at work, and that calls for a proper balance of work and family life."
"in writing. - (SV) The June List considers that issues of health and safety at work are essentially a national matter."
"Obviously everything, from phasing out asbestos in the workplace to the protection of health care workers who work with sharp instruments, is important."
"But we have every confidence that the Member States are competent to formulate adequate national strategies on health and safety at work."
"We would therefore question what practical added value EU ideas in this area can bring."
"On the basis of the arguments made above we have voted in favour of the amendment to limit the strategy on health and safety at work and against the report in the final vote."
"in writing. - (RO) I am in favour of this report and I support the proposal of using the Structural Funds to invest in mining infrastructure in order to prevent so many occupational accidents occurring in this sector."
"The European Union cannot have a credible strategy of labour protection without providing financial support to the Member States."
"Mining is Romania's hardest hit industry, having the highest number of occupational accidents, but the insufficient national resources are available for improving working conditions."
"The European Union can remedy the situation by the funding it makes available to the Member States."
"I would also like to propose that part of the European funding available under the human resources operational programme should be used for the training and equipment of labour inspection departments."
"It is important that all Member States should reach the minimum level specified by the World Labour Organization, of at least one labour protection inspector for every 10 000 workers."
"in writing. - (FR) The aims of the Community strategy on health and safety at work for 2007-2012 - while undoubtedly laudable in themselves - are unlikely to be realised, just as the Lisbon strategy is unlikely to be realised by 2010."
"Moreover, such is the degree of disparity in legislation on these matters in Europe that they are not readily manageable at Community level, and the big risk is that health and safety standards will converge towards the lowest common denominator."
"Instead of publicising the benefits and advantages it has to offer, Europe should be taking practical action and attacking the factors that actually place working people at risk, namely insecurity, unemployment and poverty."
"When these have been addressed, and only then, questions of health and safety at work can, of course, be resolved in the ongoing process of common standard-setting."
"Our leaders in Europe are mistaken: encouraging immigration is not the way to reduce levels of poverty or its prevalence, or to promote growth."
"That much is plain from the fact that the last 10 years, with immigration at unprecedented levels, have seen lower than ever growth rates by comparison with the rest of the world."
"The Community strategy for health and safety at work has not taken these parameters into account."
"We shall therefore vote against the report."
"in writing. - I found that the report was a very encouraging step towards ensuring a safer workplace."
"The need for increased funding to guarantee health and safety measures are met in areas such as mining, steelmaking and shipbuilding is essential, especially in such high risk industries."
"The call to protect health workers from blood-borne infections, and to introduce new legislation on occupational diseases, takes account of the profound changes in the dangers that workers now face in their day-to-day work."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - Mr President, I am delighted to congratulate our rapporteur on a balanced report taking account of an important strategy, as the EU has been instrumental in raising health and safety standards at work across the EU and the Community strategy to 2012 looks set to continue that work."
"However, we must always be mindful that there does come a time when standards are sufficiently high and the focus must go to enforcement, not new legislative or regulatory burdens."
"We must keep an eye on this area to ensure that a proper balance is struck, and this report takes us in that direction."
"in writing. - (NL) Health and safety at work have an extremely important part to play on the European agenda and in the Lisbon Strategy."
"Investment in them increases productivity and reduces social security costs."
"The previous policy plan, for instance, already significantly reduced the number of accidents at the workplace."
"For the new policy period (up to 2012), further efforts will be made to achieve a 25% reduction, and the Commission undertakes to help SMEs implement the existing regulatory legal framework."
"The Willmott report improves considerably on the Commission proposal."
"It aims at a suitable mix of tougher and better labour inspections, effective prevention, appropriate incentives and sanctions, together with sharing best practice and increasing worker participation."
"With a few 'green' amendments such as greater attention to the group of agency staff (women, migrant workers), temporary and poorly trained workers, and attention to the underlying causes of mental illness and to mental health, to addiction and psychological risks at work, such as stress, harassment and bullying, as well as violence, I fully support this report."
"in writing. - (EL) The Community Strategy 2007-2012 on Health and Safety at Work does not deal with the actual causes of accidents and conceals the irresponsibility of capital."
"The proposed measures are piecemeal, limited to management of today's criminal reality at the expense of the working class and employees generally."
"Accidents at work are the heavy price the working class is made to pay, within the scope of the barbarous spread of capitalism, all for the sake of profit."
"Accidents at work each year are steadily increasing in Greece and in the other EU Member States, with the result that thousands of workers lose their lives and thousands of others suffer insurmountable problems."
"The Εuropean Union, true to the anti-labour Lisbon Strategy, is shifting the weight of responsibility onto the workers, and is strengthening privatisation in the field of health and safety at work, proposing access to private external agencies, downgrading the role of public control mechanisms, and remaining silent about the responsibilities of enterprises."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"(CS) Mr Chairman, I would just like to ask whether today's special regime will be repeated or whether it was really only today's extravaganza."
"Can you give me an answer, please?"
"As I understand it, this was an exceptional situation as regards the number of applications."
"I hope that this situation will not be repeated."
"Closure of the sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at 23.05)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)"
"Presentation of the programme of the Slovenian Presidency (debate)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, today is a very special day."
"It is a special day because for the first time in the history of the European Union the representative, the Prime Minister of this country, namely Slovenia, has the Presidency of the European Union. Slovenia is a country that joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 along with nine other countries."
"And it is the first time that one of the former communist countries now living according to the basic principles of freedom, democracy and parliamentarianism, namely Slovenia, has the Presidency of the European Union."
"I therefore warmly welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, the Prime Minister of Slovenia, Janez Janša."
"Welcome to the European Parliament!"
"(Applause)"
"Today is also special for another reason, however, and I therefore extend a particularly warm welcome to the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durão Barroso, because it is exactly 50 years ago that the first President of the European Commission, Walter Hallstein, convened his first Commission."
"The 50th anniversary of the European Commission is another event for us to celebrate."
"And so I also send the Commission, as an exception in this rather solemn context, all good wishes for this special birthday."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to listen to the report of the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Many thanks to the President-in-Office of the Council, Prime Minister Janša."
"It is wonderful that Slovenia has the Presidency."
"The Group Chairmen will soon be expressing their affirmations, but I can say now, on behalf of the entire Parliament, that the European Parliament stands alongside Slovenia in creating a successful European Union and we are therefore sure that the Slovenian Presidency will be a great success."
"Now I would like to ask the President of the Commission to speak to us."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, Prime Minister, Members of Parliament, my first word goes to the Slovenian Presidency."
"Indeed, it is the first time a Member State of the last enlargement has assumed this very important responsibility."
"Slovenia is a great example of the success of the enlargement."
"It was the first country to adopt the euro."
"The example of Slovenia demonstrates that the Member States which joined the European Union in 2004 and 2007 are now at the core of European integration."
"It also shows the very important European credentials of Slovenia."
"I wish to express to Prime Minister Janša my full support for the next six months for the very important task of being President of the European Council."
"You, Prime Minister, dear friend, and your country, are symbols of the struggle for freedom, a fundamental value for Europe."
"And thank you for reminding us of these great celebrations of Schengen."
"I was very moved to be with you and with others on that border between Slovenia and Italy, and I will not forget the words you used at that moment, reminding us that, about 20 years ago, people were killed there by the Yugoslav Army when they were trying to reach freedom, to reach Italy, to reach the European Union."
"It was indeed a very impressive journey that I undertook with Prime Minister Socrates and the President of the European Council, and at the end of December we visited Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic; we were also on the border between Estonia and Finland, Slovakia, Hungary and Austria, and we saw the emotion expressed in the eyes of so many people."
"I think it is important to remind ourselves about this, from where we are now."
"Listening to you today, Prime Minister Janša, could only reinforce my firm belief that this enlargement of 2004-2007, which united Europe in peace and democracy, is indeed one of the greatest achievements of European history, and we should be proud of it."
"The Commission will work very closely with the Slovenian Presidency on central issues of its programme, such as the stability of the Western Balkans, Kosovo, and Bosnia in particular, but also enlargement, the European neighbourhood policy, asylum and immigration, cooperation with strategic partners and intercultural dialogue."
"Let me concentrate on three issues that are very much linked with our responsibility."
"I would like to focus on three priorities: the Treaty of Lisbon, the package on energy and climate change, and the renewed Lisbon Strategy."
"The year 2007 leaves the European Union in good shape."
"Progress towards the conclusion of a new Treaty met our expectations."
"The Union followed the roadmap that was presented by the Commission in May 2006: first the Berlin Declaration, which celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome and outlined a vision for the future of the Union; then the June European Council, where we agreed - under the German Presidency - on a precise mandate for the IGC; and finally, the signature of the Treaty of Lisbon in December."
"The process of reaching agreement showed a remarkable degree of consensus between Member States and European institutions on the way forward."
"We have a credible and balanced Treaty, and I believe that it provides strong foundations for the future."
"We have avoided much of the disunity and disagreements of previous institutional debates."
"This leaves the Union in good shape to ensure we deliver our political priority for this year. The political priority for this year is the successful ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I call on all Member States to proceed swiftly and decisively to ensure ratification of this European Treaty."
"Next week, the Commission will adopt the climate change and renewable energy package."
"Our proposals meet the ambition set by all Heads of State and Government in last year's Spring European Council, who called for precise and legally binding targets."
"The Commission is now acting on that mandate."
"I see with great satisfaction that this is also a priority, both for the Slovenian Presidency of the Council and for Parliament."
"We will have to work hard to have the package adopted by the end of 2008."
"Our package will complement the proposals presented last year on the energy internal market."
"A European energy market will give more options and better prices to European citizens, and it is essential to meet the three central challenges which the European Union faces in energy: competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply."
"We knew from the very beginning that transforming Europe into a low-carbon economy is not an easy task."
"But this is the moment to be serious, responsible and coherent with our commitment."
"The Commission will follow a balanced approach to efforts asked of the Member States."
"They start from different places; they have different circumstances; some are more able than others to finance investment."
"We also need to minimise the costs of adaptation for European industry and to address the challenges faced by energy intensive industries."
"The Commission is well aware of these realities, as our proposals will show."
"But do not expect us to compromise on the European interest, which is to lead global efforts to fight climate change, to ensure energy security and to provide a competitive advantage to our economies."
"Both our international credibility and the credibility before European citizens depend on the fulfilment of the targets established in March 2007."
"Bali was a great success in setting out a roadmap to agreement, but our package next week is a clear demonstration of our willingness to put our money where our mouth is."
"The energy and climate change package should be seen as an opportunity for Europe in economic terms."
"It will encourage innovation and it will increase competitiveness."
"It is a mistake to set the fight against climate change against the competitiveness of European industries."
"The Union should lead global efforts to tackle climate change, and European industries should continue to be world leaders."
"At the same time, we will also create new markets and new jobs and will have the 'first mover' advantage in many of those sectors."
"It is true that our package aims at a more environment-friendly Europe, but it will also contribute to a more industry-friendly, a more job-friendly and a more consumer-friendly Europe."
"It will be a win-win initiative."
"Three years after the relaunch in 2005, the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs is working."
"It has contributed to a better performance of the European economy, in particular to the creation of 6.5 million new jobs over the last two years."
"We expect the creation of five million jobs up to 2009."
"Structural reforms are also helping economic growth and improving the prospects for European long-term prosperity."
"These are very encouraging achievements."
"As we launch the next Lisbon cycle, we need to take ambitious decisions in the Spring Council on areas such as research, innovation, the business environment, professional skills and the qualification of labour."
"The Commission is making proposals to turn the fifth freedom - the free movement of knowledge - into a European reality in order to speed up innovation and make it available to a higher number of European citizens."
"We also need a Small Business Act for Europe to foster the growth of the small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Those small and medium-sized enterprises create nine out of ten new jobs."
"This is a priority for the Commission in 2008."
"Last but not least, Europe needs active labour policies: policies that give people the skills to realise their potential, and policies that allow our citizens to secure their employability."
"Investing in people is the surest way to guarantee our citizens that they will remain employed in spite of moving from job to job."
"We need to offer prosperity, not just for some, not even only for the majority, but for all."
"This is why investing in people and modernising labour markets remains one of the four priority areas for the new Lisbon cycle."
"We must promote the entrepreneur spirit of Europeans: the creation of jobs, innovation and competition are keys to European success."
"Economic forecasts for 2008 and 2009 are already slightly less optimistic, and we should take these signals seriously."
"We know that the cause of this is some financial instability coming from the other side of the Atlantic."
"Yet we should fight negative discourses."
"Our economic fundamentals are sound and solid."
"We also know that economic downturn could blunt the readiness to pursue economic and social reforms."
"It may be a natural reaction, but it would be the wrong lesson to draw from past experience."
"Global competition and the prosperity of our citizens require that Europe continue its reform process to be a more competitive economy."
"This is the only way to keep our model, our European model of social cohesion."
"One of the keys to success in 2007 was the Commission's ability to work well with Parliament and the Council."
"We would never have had agreement on the Lisbon Treaty or solutions for difficult dossiers like the European Institute of Technology and Galileo without this partnership approach."
"The triangular institutional partnership between Parliament, the Slovenian Presidency of the Council and the Commission will be crucial to our success in 2008."
"With a ratified Treaty, an agreed energy and climate change package, and a delivering Lisbon Strategy of growth and jobs, we will certainly have in 2009 a more confident and a better prepared Europe to face the future."
"Finally, let me thank President Pöttering for his congratulations on the 50th anniversary of the first meeting of the European Commission."
"Indeed, it has been a long journey since 1958 for this institution."
"The European Commission has been at the centre of the European integration process as a source of dynamism and ambition, as a reference for all those who believe in the European project."
"Today I am proud to be leading this institution at the beginning of the 21st century as we face new challenges and require new solutions."
"The European Commission will remain loyal to Walter Hallstein and all the founding fathers who, 50 years ago, launched this great institution as a central player in our common project."
"In close cooperation with Parliament and with the Council, we will continue to promote our common goals: a strong Europe, an open Europe, a Europe of freedom, prosperity and solidarity."
"And we are quite sure that, working hand-in-hand with the Slovenian Presidency and with Prime Minister Janša, we will achieve concrete results for our citizens."
"Many thanks, Commission President."
"Walter Hallstein said on 16 January 1958 - I quote, because it is a short sentence addressed to the Members of the Commission: 'Your work will bear fruit, however, only when there is close cooperation with the other bodies, particularly the Council of Ministers and Parliament's Assembly.'"
"End of quote."
"Today we are the European Parliament and what applied then in 1958 also applies today in 2008, and I have no doubt at all that, when the European institutions work together, they will also be successful."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the European Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is fortunate that the desire of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for Europe in 2008 to be effective and able to respond to the concerns of its citizens coincides with the Slovenian Presidency of the European Union."
"Slovenia, your beloved country, Prime Minister Janša, is indeed a country that works."
"The macroeconomic indicators and nature of the political debate prove this."
"Slovenians are in the vanguard of making people feel they belong to Europe."
"Slovenians are among the most effective at achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"During her journey to EU accession and since 2004, Slovenia has achieved many successes."
"What we have done, or not quite done, in 50 years, Slovenia has managed to do in 10, while making the difficult transition from socialism to a market economy, without disrupting society."
"A strong privatised economy, stable inflation, rising salaries, a relatively low unemployment rate and above all a strong currency that enabled you to join the euro in 2007."
"You have also joined the Schengen area and you are now the first of the new Member States to take the reins of the EU."
"The Slovenian Presidency undeniably marks the integration of the new Member States within the European Union."
"By taking responsibility for following through the ratification process of the Lisbon Treaty, by directing the efforts being made by the 27 Member States to meet the challenges Europe has to face in terms of energy and climate change, growth and employment, by continuing the integration process of the Western Balkans, by contributing through your initiatives to the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, which will provide the chance to reaffirm the values of openness, tolerance and dialogue that are at the heart of the European project, the Slovenian Presidency is showing that the countries that have joined the EU since 2004 are now familiar not only with the EU's institutional affairs, but also with its internal functioning and the way Europe asserts its interests at international level."
"President of the Council, the PPE-DE Group will be alongside you, supporting the achievement of your priority objectives."
"The future of Europe will be played out with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Effectiveness is therefore vital if ratification is to be achieved so that new instruments are available by the time of the European Parliament elections in 2009."
"Our group will also support your efforts to launch the new cycle of the Lisbon Strategy effectively and to guarantee a prosperous, equitable and environmentally-friendly future for Europe and ensure our economy is in a good position to benefit from the opportunities offered by globalisation."
"Therefore, to create favourable conditions for social growth, to make knowledge and innovation drivers for growth and to find answers for demographic challenges, energy supply and climate change, Europe must play a dominant role in negotiations with its global partners on a post-Kyoto system."
"President-in-Office of the Council, concerning the Balkans and the prospects for the Western Balkans joining Europe, we will support your efforts to foster stability and cooperation in the region, because the security and prosperity of the whole EU depend on this."
"The EU and your Presidency must play their part in resolving the issue of Kosovo's status."
"The bridging role between East and West that Slovenia has often played in Europe historically and geographically is an asset for the EU and its Member States."
"At the crossroads of all the influences that have marked the history of our continent, Slovenia is a constant thoroughfare for people, goods and cultural currents of all kinds."
"Slovenia will be the ideal promoter of dialogue between the different cultures, creeds and religious and spiritual traditions in the context of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"Mr President, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, this I say on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I look forward to an effective Europe in 2008, a successful Europe. The EU Presidency is undoubtedly a considerable challenge for a country like Slovenia, particularly in view of its human resources and the size of its government administration, as you have said."
"However, President-in-Office, other EU Member States - Luxembourg, Austria - have proved many times over that European conviction, tradition and performance are not measured by the size of countries."
"All the best to the Slovenian Presidency!"
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to emphasise once again on behalf of my Group what I said to you, Prime Minister, on two occasions in Ljubljana: as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we are prepared to support your Presidency in any way we can."
"It is - as you have rightly said - a historic Presidency."
"The Presidency of a state that has emerged from a communist dictatorship - and this should not be belittled - with a Prime Minister who was himself a victim of this dictatorship, is in fact a Presidency that not only deserves the full support of all democrats, but also has a great opportunity to recapture the hearts of the people again because it gives us here in Parliament as well as in Europe the opportunity once again to show that change is possible and in the long run freedom always prevails and democracy will always triumph!"
"Your country is also proof of this: no dictatorship in the world will survive in the long run."
"It may do so for 10, 30 or 100 years, but in the end democracy always triumphs, and this is a positive sign."
"Your introductions, refreshing in their objectiveness, should set the tone for the whole of 2008."
"I do not know what awaits us in the second half of the year, but we have at least discussed policy today and that is something we very much appreciate."
"The fact that today we have been discussing policy rather than personal matters is perhaps the first difference to the second half of this year."
"It is striking, however, that we have already established a few differences."
"One difference I would like to expand on is that yes, the enlargement of the European Union is not over."
"Yes, the enlargement of the European Union is currently under negotiation."
"Yes, it is under negotiation with Macedonia, yes it is under negotiation with Croatia and yes, it is under negotiation with Turkey."
"You have revealed that you are seeking negotiations with Turkey with the aim of membership."
"The Council Presidency for the second half of 2008 does not want this."
"What we want, however, is clarity from the Council."
"Are negotiations currently taking place with Turkey with the aim of membership or not?"
"This is one of the crucial points you will need to clarify first as best you can in the framework of the Troika during your Presidency of the Council."
"The second difference - and we have listened very attentively to this - is that you consider the European institutions strong enough to organise the neighbourhood policy themselves by their own efforts."
"Well said!"
"This is a clear rebuff to the separate institutions of the Mediterranean Union proposed by your heir presumptive to the office of Council President."
"Very good - we support you in this, too!"
"(Applause)"
"We can therefore see a few rifts lurking in the Council, but you can rely on the fact that the Socialist Group at least is on your side, Mr Janša."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has talked about the opening up of the Schengen borders."
"This, too, is an important point and I thank you for this commitment to the great opportunity that the associated freedom of movement offers our citizens."
"I thank you, too, for the clear declaration - from a state like Slovenia, a state with your country's history - that you see it as an opportunity for the freedom of your people, because by it you are also sending out a signal against the far right in Europe, which abuses every one of these freedoms with its rhetoric of fear against Europe and makes people afraid of any imponderable developments instead of reassuring them of the opportunities that freedom brings."
"(Applause)"
"I have a request for you, Commission President."
"In Germany the relocation of Nokia is currently the subject of great debate."
"You have just said that the strength of Europe's economy lies in its small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This is correct, but we also still have an enormous share in industrial jobs."
"In my country the Minister for Economic Affairs of North Rhine-Westphalia is now asserting that this relocation of Nokia from Bochum in Germany to Romania would be financed by EU funds."
"I don't believe it, but please could you check it and clarify that this is not the case, because rhetoric such as this, as bitter and painful as it is, if not true, is also simply grist to the mill of those who are against the construction of a united Europe."
"Clarification is therefore very important here."
"(Applause)"
"One final comment to the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission."
"Yes, Walter Hallstein was a great man."
"As one of the founding fathers of the European Union and one of the Presidents of the Commission, he made a huge contribution, but the extent to which those who would imitate Hallstein have already removed themselves from his founding work can be seen in you, Mr President, 50 years on."
"Mr Hallstein was a fervent advocate of Turkey's membership of the European Union."
"You are indeed somewhat sceptical of this, as are all your colleagues."
"In this respect yes, Walter Hallstein was a great European!"
"(Applause)"
"Many thanks to my colleague, Martin Schulz."
"Conventions in the House make it impossible - or at least not customary - for a proper answer to be given to the President on tongue-in-cheek contributions from Group Chairmen."
"If I had been in another role, it would have been a pleasure to give you an answer, but I am grateful for Walter Hallstein's friendly comments."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I should like to address some remarks to Prime Minister Janša."
"President-in-Office, my group comes to you with one simple message: 'Europe expects'."
"It expects 2008 to be a year of progress."
"We expect that progress to start now."
"And we expect your Presidency to rise to the challenge."
"I have no doubts you will."
"Was it not a feisty Slovene who, raising his fist against a mighty empire, first declared: 'All roads do not lead to Rome!'?"
"Well, neither do they lead to Paris, and this is not the start of the French Presidency."
"It is an historic first for the countries which entered our Union in 2004."
"President-in-Office, your country may be small in size but we know that it is mighty in spirit, and we know too that Europe's Davids often make better presidencies than its Goliaths."
"True to form, your Presidency's programme combines quiet ambition and a consensual style, which have the potential to unite our continent."
"Such unity will be vital to the early ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and to mustering support for an interinstitutional agreement on how to govern Europe under that new Treaty."
"On interinstitutional cooperation, we would welcome much dialogue with you and a greater presence of your Government in this Chamber."
"We regret that your seat was empty yesterday when we heard from the first guest in our Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"Your programme speaks of the importance of internal dynamism - and that, Mr Schulz, is the way to create jobs and to maintain jobs in this continent: internal dynamism."
"We rely on you, President-in-Office, to push forward the single market in energy, in telecoms, in health-care services."
"The European Union has a hard enough time convincing its citizens that it adds value to their daily lives, so, in a clear-cut case for faster medical care, for lower bills, for greater consumer choice, we would be mad to push proposals for patients' rights off the table just because they are controversial."
"In other areas, you will have to flex your muscles a great deal more - particularly with your presidential counterparts who have a vested interest in promoting nuclear energy as the panacea of climate change."
"Solidarity and burden-sharing are the key to success in cutting emissions and meeting renewable energy targets."
"In 2008, our Union must show, as President Barroso said, that it can turn fine words about combating climate change into action."
"Progress in the Western Balkans is rightly one of your priorities and your experience and understanding of the area will be a bonus to our Union."
"Nonetheless, I suspect that maintaining, as you do, that the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is worse than that in Kosovo does not reflect majority opinion in the Union."
"Nor am I sure it is a good way to motivate the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"If it is designed to appease Serbia, it will not work."
"Sweetening the pill of Kosovo's independence with a Stabilisation and Association Agreement may be a way forward."
"But, while Mr Đelić readies his pen to come to Brussels, my group reiterates - in the strongest possible terms - that there can be no Stabilisation and Association Agreement without Serbia's full cooperation with the ICTY."
"(Applause)"
"Serge Brammertz, the new Chief Prosecutor, has yet to see fresh evidence of cooperation."
"None of us, President-in-Office, wish to see Serbia remain on Europe's sidelines, and your Presidency's courteous and constructive attitude may well bring it in from the cold and deliver Ratko Mladić."
"But in the mean time, as you say in Slovenia, 'pray for a good harvest, but keep on hoeing'."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, the Slovenian Government is taking over the responsibility of the EU presidency at a time of many challenges."
"The European countries have to tackle ratification of the Treaty; the spotlight is being trained on the Balkan region; an agreement has to be reached at EU level on the energy package; and new impetus has to be found in order to resolve the conflict between Palestine and Israel."
"As has rightly been commented on by colleagues already, the list of what Europe needs to be doing is endless."
"The range of topics and decisions and the areas of interest and of conflict that have to be dealt with are enormous."
"Rather than give lectures to you on what you fail to do or on what others may fail to do in the future, I shall focus briefly on three areas."
"Firstly, the Reform Treaty, the Lisbon Treaty: its ratification is essential for the onward development of the European Union."
"Secondly, with regard to future enlargements: we must ensure that candidate countries feel they have an opportunity and a chance to become members of the European Union in the near future."
"Thirdly and, in my opinion, most importantly, Kosovo and what is happening there, and a peaceful transition from its present status to whatever future status may emerge."
"We have already seen tremendous success in Kosovo where joint police forces from both ethnic groups are patrolling jointly in each other's areas, where there is no longer that idea of a single police force for a single people, but a joint police force for all the people of Kosovo."
"Your experience, Mr Prime Minister, as a rebel in one sense, as an intellectual but, most importantly of all, as a democrat and as the voice of reason that could lead your country from the dark ages of Communism into the bright lights - sometimes dimmed because of energy crises - and future of the European Union, that kind of image and that kind of imagery is what is most important to the people of Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo and, indeed, Turkey."
"I look forward to working with you and with your Government."
"Despite the fact that you may be small as a country, not only are you big in spirit but there is also great quality there."
"As has already been proven by your own starting of this process, you are not afraid to stand up to the 'big boys' when they try to bully you around the place."
"But, most importantly of all, what you bring is the moral certainty of where you have come from."
"What the European Union needs today is new heroes - heroes who know what it is like not to have freedom; heroes who know what it is like not to have the freedom of speech, liberty and democracy."
"That is the best light that we can shine in the dark corners of the European continent today."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we are quite sentimental about Europe and what it has achieved as a model of peace and democracy and what it might achieve in terms of boosting people's freedom and well-being and representing a centre of innovation and consistency in tackling global environmental challenges."
"We are therefore delighted to welcome you here today, but we are a little sad that this experience might in some ways be a unique one, because, as you know, one of the reforms of the Lisbon Treaty is the election of the President of the European Council."
"This is something that is of concern to us, partly because none of the candidates who have been put forward would in my opinion be able to advance the cause of Europe very far."
"Having said that, however, I would like to mention some specific points that are especially relevant for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"As the President of the Commission mentioned, during your Presidency the 'energy package' is to be presented: this is the result of the work done by all last year and we know that there is a widespread commotion about it and manoeuvring and pressures are already in progress to diminish its value and impact."
"We believe that a fundamental aspect of your Presidency will be to resist these pressures from both major and minor players to restrict and weaken the impact of these regulations."
"We will also continue our battle on principle, on which I believe that we will be in disagreement."
"In our view, a low carbon economy - here I am also addressing the President of the Commission - cannot be a nuclear economy; funding and wasting time on a new nuclear future which does not exist yet or on expensive technologies of uncertain application such as carbon sequestration and storage are actually in direct competition with the true renewable energies which we should encourage and fund: sun and wind energy, and energy saving, this latter being the most promising prospect for innovation and employment."
"Another important issue during your Presidency will be coordinating territorial and urban development, which will be highly important in view of the Spring Summit and which make reference to the follow-up to the Leipzig Charter: safeguarding the quality of our cities and the enhancement of territorial cohesion are perhaps less in fashion than other issues, but we believe them to be absolutely crucial in the battle against climate change."
"Waste legislation will also probably be completed during your Presidency."
"We are extremely concerned, not only by what is happening in my country, in Naples, but also because it seems to us that the lip service paid to the hierarchy of waste strategies, placing a priority on prevention and re-use, is actually contradicted by the text of this legislation, which once again gives priority to incinerators, which, in our view, are definitely not the only way of solving the waste problem."
"There are two important issues relating to trade and data protection on which we would really like to see whether your Presidency will truly be a friend to this institution or not."
"You will have to battle hard with some of your colleagues on the issue of Parliament's assent to the economic partnership agreements with the ACP countries, which, following the strong disagreements with the African countries that emerged in Lisbon, we view as more vital than ever."
"Then there is freedom of access to negotiating documents on the partnership and cooperation agreements with countries such as China."
"Just think - the European Parliament has not yet been told anything at all about how these negotiations are going."
"Everything is being done in total secrecy!"
"We believe that there ought to be an open debate on this issue and that this Parliament should at least be informed about what is going on."
"Finally, President-in-Office, I would like to mention the data protection issue."
"We know that the Council is planning to take a decision on this during your Presidency, but we would ask you to be courageous and request that implementation of this framework decision be postponed until after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, because this would enable Parliament to play a direct part in the reform; my fellow Member will speak to you about this again later on, I ask you, President-in-Office, to hold the first national conference on the Roma people during your Presidency."
"This would make a significant contribution to intercultural dialogue."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, for this first Presidency of a new Member State, Slovenia is inheriting a number of rather thankless tasks from its predecessors."
"Thus, as regards the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, you are required to ensure that no Member State apart from Ireland sets the bad example of organising a referendum, including countries that have made firm commitments to do so."
"This is to some extent like moving backwards at a time when the EU's citizens and institutions are supposed to be moving closer together."
"Frankly, you deserve to have been given a nobler ambition."
"At the social level, the Presidency will first have the difficult task of getting things moving again on two emblematic draft directives, one on working time and the sadly famous opt-out, and the other on temporary work and equal treatment of employees."
"Nor will it escape a substantive discussion on the action to be taken in the wake of the recent judgments by the European Court of Justice in the Laval/Vaxholm and Viking Line cases, which lend legitimacy to social dumping."
"My group, moreover, has requested a debate on this matter to be put on the agenda of a forthcoming parliamentary session."
"This brings up again the whole problem of the Bolkestein Directive and the provisions of the treaty on which it is based."
"In the midst of the ratification of a new text that includes all these provisions, this makes for a real muddle."
"Finally, again on the social level, Europe is facing increasing demands for higher pay."
"Indeed its share of added value has been diminishing for some decades."
"It has never been so low, as even the financial press are pointing out."
"Yet, the European Central Bank has just threatened to raise interest rates if this demand, however legitimate, is met, despite the fact that profits have never been so high, as the experts acknowledge."
"If we do not put this issue on the agenda, it will soon make its own way there."
"I recall that the joint document of the German, Portuguese and Slovenian Presidencies underlines in point 68 that, I quote 'The overarching aims of the three Presidencies will be to strengthen the European Social Model as an integral part of the Lisbon Strategy'."
"As the adage goes, the proof of the pudding is in the eating!"
"A word also about another sensitive subject: that of illegal migrants."
"In its current state, the draft directive on their return deserves the 'outrageous directive' label given to it by organisations that defend human rights."
"Adoption in its current state would cast an unkind light on the good intentions expressed by the EU in the context of intercultural dialogue."
"To conclude, I would like to mention the problem of Kosovo."
"Before any decision is made, surely it would be justified to have clarification on a three-pronged question?"
"Firstly, how to explain the fact that two billion euros of aid from the international community have, in the space of seven years, resulted in non-existent economic development, endemic poverty, 50% unemployment, and the proliferation of corruption and mafia networks?"
"Secondly, how to explain the fact that 17 000 NATO soldiers have proved unable to prevent the destruction of dozens of orthodox buildings, the kidnapping or murder of hundreds of Kosovar citizens from minority communities and the forced exile of thousands of others?"
"Finally, how will the unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo and the replacement of UNMIK with the European Union solve these vitally important problems while guaranteeing the stability of the Balkans?"
"I would be curious to hear your response."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office for the nice visit we had to Slovenia before Christmas."
"President-in-Office, I hope you will lead the European Council better than you led the meeting group leaders had with you: you took most of the speaking time yourself and you said nothing we did not know in advance; you did not allow your ministers, whom I would expect to know their subjects, to answer most of our questions; and you did not send the answers in writing afterwards."
"A parliament also contains an opposition with certain rights."
"Yesterday I received a petition from 571 Slovenian journalists criticising you for not respecting their press freedom."
"Will you allow an independent investigation?"
"Last week you were reported to have asked Portugal to cancel the possible referendum supported by most Portuguese voters."
"May I remind you of the existing Nice Treaty, which requires you to take all decisions as close to citizens as possible?"
"To cancel a referendum is a violation of this article."
"Member States can be criticised but not punished, because ratification is still a national competence."
"The behaviour of a presidency and the European Commission is a Community affair."
"You have to respect the national ratification procedures."
"If you say something, you should remind Member States of the joint legal obligation to legislate as close to the citizens as possible."
"You violate the Treaty, and so does the European Commission when it does not behave as guardian of this Treaty article."
"You are part of a political agreement among prime ministers to avoid a referendum."
"This agreement is a violation of the Treaty."
"The Commission should have protested it instead of supporting the attempt to avoid the peoples of Europe."
"Read Article 1 of the Treaty on European Union once more: 'Decisions are taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen'."
"What a wonderful sentence that would be, if it were implemented!"
"The Lisbon Treaty was decided in as closed a way as possible and as far away as possible from the voters."
"Now it seems that only Ireland can save our European democracy."
"But the Council could at least publish a consolidated version of the Lisbon Treaty, so that you would be able to read what you have signed."
"On 17 December 2007, Hungary signed a text it had not even received!"
"This is not a way to decide close to the citizens or the Members of Parliament."
"Mr Bonde, we look to you as Chairman of your Group to ensure that you and your colleagues acquit yourselves in the House as parliamentarians."
"Face up to the challenges in your own right rather than merely targeting others!"
"(Applause)"
"- (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, as a Member from Carinthia, an immediate neighbour of Slovenia, it is awe-inspiring and a pleasure for me that a nation that only 20 years ago was groaning under the yoke of communism is now in charge of the European Union for six months."
"This is proof for me that the path of European integration away from the catastrophes of the 20th century is the right one in itself to freedom and unity."
"When I hear that Slovenia's aim during this Council Presidency is primarily to introduce all the states of the former Yugoslavia to the European Union, then I believe that it is right and it is important, in order to round off this process of European integration territorially, as it were."
"I believe that this is considerably more important than, for example, the accession negotiations with a country like Turkey, whose primary territory is in Anatolia, in Asia."
"I believe that this process of introducing states of the former Yugoslavia to the EU would need to take place primarily in such a way that it enables Europeans to act without the influence of powers outside Europe, for instance the United States of America and Russia."
"I hope that Slovenia is able to bear in mind first and foremost Croatia's desire for EU membership and that conflicts like those surrounding fishing zones between Croatia and Slovenia, for instance, will not present any obstacle to this, because of the countries of the former Yugoslavia, Croatia, along with Slovenia, is undoubtedly the country that is most ready for Europe and a democratically mature, central European country."
"On the issue of Kosovo, which will undoubtedly tax Slovenia's Presidency of the Council the most, the situation is such that on the one hand, we have to take account of the right of each people group to self-determination, the right of the majority of the Albanian Kosovars, but on the other hand, we also have to consider the historic rights of the Serbs."
"Something like a US satellite state should not be allowed to emerge with Kosovo, nor should Serbia be driven into the arms of Moscow, into the arms of the Kremlin."
"Kosovo's autonomy should not become a precedent for Turkish Northern Cyprus."
"The aim should be stability in the Balkans and the rounding off of European integration in territorial terms."
"Let me get down to discussing in a nutshell a bilateral problem between Slovenia and Austria: the issue of topographic signs in Carinthia."
"I hope that the Austrian Federal Government will soon find a fair solution that satisfies the eminently well protected Slovenian minority in Austria."
"By the same token, I hope that Slovenia also finds a sensible solution regarding the German-speaking Austrian residual minority in Slovenia and recognises these people as an indigenous minority, and that the cultural convention between Austria and Slovenia can be full of substance in this regard."
"(SL) Ladies and Gentlemen, the programme of the Slovenian Presidency contains all the important topics of our time and is a good working basis for these six months."
"With just two minutes, I will limit myself to only one area, i.e. citizens' freedom, administration of justice and internal affairs."
"I expect the Slovenian Presidency to devote appropriate attention to following the effects of the ""SIS 1 for all” information system and accelerate the implementation of ""SIS 2”."
"The common asylum and migration policy must be based on close cooperation with the countries of transit and origin."
"At the moment there are 27 different regimes and approaches to solving this problem and, of course, we have no illusions that such a complicated question can be resolved in such a short time."
"However, we have to tackle this difficult task."
"The third area is cooperation with Frontex, where the Slovenian Presidency, based on analysis of the Commission report, will prepare the guidelines for the future activities of that agency."
"The fourth area concerns urgent harmonisation of the European visa policy and shaping of the legal groundwork for starting the operation of the European visa information system."
"A red thread running through all the Presidencies so far has been the fight against organised crime and terrorism."
"I support the proposed measures and suggest that we should at last start tackling the causes of terrorism as well."
"Slovenia is one of the most successful members of the European Union in the area of e-administration and the elimination of administrative obstacles."
"I therefore expect Slovenia, during its Presidency, to offer its good practice in every area to the other Member States."
"I also hope for good cooperation between the Slovenian Presidency and the Parliament and Commission, and I am convinced that, after the Slovenian Presidency, it will be possible to say that the European Union has made a further step forward."
"(SL) I am proud that the Prime Minister of Slovenia is addressing the European Parliament today in the capacity of President of the European Council."
"As the Prime Minister said, this is also a testimony not only to the dramatic changes witnessed in Slovenia in the last twenty years, but also to the almost unimaginable changes we have witnessed within Europe itself in this very short period of history."
"The Vice-President of the European Commission said in Ljubljana that the start of the Slovenian Presidency of the European Council was the end of the division between the old and new members of the European Union."
"I would like to build on that beautiful thought by saying that until recently we could only listen to what the candidates and thereafter new members of the European Union expected from it."
"Today Europe has the right to ask the Prime Minister of Slovenia, and Slovenia as the presiding country, what Europe can expect from Slovenia."
"I think we are faced with an exceptional historic event which has its symbolic and real consequences."
"It is my personal conviction that it can expect the most Slovenia can give."
"In my opinion, Slovenia is well prepared for and totally focused on its international role and the presiding role of the European Council."
"I would like to thank my colleague Mr Schulz for the support our group gave the Slovenian Presidency and, as President of the largest opposition party in Slovenia - the Social Democrats - I would also like to assure this esteemed House that, in the light of the parliamentary elections which will follow the end of the Slovenian Presidency of the European Union, I will not use the European politics of the Slovenian Presidency of the European Union to make it a target or a victim of our common endeavours for Slovenian success in this important international task."
"The success of the Prime Minister will be the success of the Slovenian Prime Minister, that of the whole of Slovenia and also my own success."
"I am convinced that at the end of the Slovenian Presidency we will be able to establish that, as someone said, there are no minor or major members of the European Union, and that there are only those which are a little bit more or a little bit less successful in their Presidency of the European Union."
"My wish is that, with a modicum of luck, the Prime Minister and the Slovenian government will succeed in being counted among the more successful."
"(SL) Prime Minister, your arrival and address today represent the start of the last phase of the full integration of Slovenia into the European Union."
"Slovenia is the first country among the eleven new countries to have been able to take over the Presidency."
"It is a great privilege for Slovenia and for Europe and I wish you great success in the Presidency."
"However, the task of the Presidency is an arduous one, which is why I would like to ask you also about the injustices taking place in the European Union."
"This question is addressed not only to you but also to the President of the Parliament and the President of the European Commission."
"In 2004 ten countries joined the European Union."
"It was actually only nine and a half as only part of Cyprus joined."
"Two years later we announced the entry of Romania and Bulgaria and again we forgot about the northern part of Cyprus."
"And even after Romania and Bulgaria had joined, we again said nothing about Cyprus."
"Prime Minister, today you spoke of western Balkans, Ukraine, Moldova, Caucasus and northern Africa without devoting a single word to the question of northern Cyprus."
"It is as though they have been overlooked, wiped out, which is not good."
"It is right that in Ljubljana you started a dialogue between cultures and religions."
"And the area where we could really achieve great success is precisely Cyprus."
"Cyprus needs to have a dialogue between cultures and religions so that those 200,000 innocent people can have an opportunity to become members of the European Union."
"Also, Cyprus has just accepted the Euro as its new currency."
"In the north they are still using the lira."
"And finally, Prime Minister, when you spoke about your culpability, that you were tried in a foreign language, I would rather you had said Serbo-Croat, or Serbian."
"Some people in this hall might think that you were perhaps tried in Russian."
"Once again, I wish you complete success in your Presidency."
"- (PL) Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Prime Minister Janša on taking up the Presidency of the Union."
"This is a historic moment in the history of European integration, it being the first time that a new Member State has taken up the Presidency."
"Slovenia is a country which has been affected on many occasions by the border changes that have taken place on our continent."
"It is therefore a good example of European unification, not only from an economic, but also from a geopolitical aspect."
"For this reason I believe that the next six months will be fruitful in stabilising the situation in the Western Balkan region."
"I would like to express the hope that the Union's neighbourhood and enlargement policy will be given priority during this period."
"I am counting on the aspirations of our eastern neighbour, Ukraine, also being received with more understanding."
"I am glad that energy policy will also be one of Slovenia's priorities."
"We are only too well aware that a secure Europe cannot exist without us ensuring our energy security."
"There must be no future blackmailing of the European Union on energy by anyone, and I am convinced that Slovenia, a country that bore the burden of communism for more than 40 years, has an excellent appreciation of this."
"Mr President, my congratulations to Slovenia, and welcome to Prime Minister Janša: only four years a member of the EU and already the European Presidency."
"It means work and responsibility, but it is also a proof of confidence in your young state, President-in-Office."
"What worries and disappoints me - us, I should say - is that an impressive number of MEPs from very different countries and groups have still not received a clear answer to their repeated request as to whether Slovenia is going to host the first annual Roma conference."
"A big thing, but also a huge challenge - and you are not alone."
"The European Commission has offered financial support."
"Moral support comes from the European Council which, in the Conclusions under point 50, underlines that the EU should appear with concrete steps on Roma issues."
"Logistical support comes from the European Roma community, who expressed willingness to cooperate closely wherever they can."
"Political support comes from many MEPs from different groups in this House who are aware of Europe's forgotten nation, the Roma, many of them still victims of the latest Balkan wars, living as refugees spread all over Europe."
"Slovenia had a narrow escape, but it deeply experienced lack of freedom and safety itself."
"I hope that Slovenia will take it as an honour to host the first annual Roma conference."
"It knows it has many supporters - and maybe, I should say, fans."
"Mr President, I too would like to wish the Slovenian Presidency well."
"Today is indeed a historic day."
"I do not doubt for a moment Slovenia's capacity as a small Member State to preside over a successful presidency."
"I hope, President-in-Office, that you are really serious when you say that you wish to see a Europe that really cares and a Europe that puts the citizen at the centre."
"I have to say to you that, if we were serious about making that more than rhetoric - making that reality - it would in fact require a radical step change in our approach and in the content of our policy in this institution and across the institutions of the European Union."
"I share the concerns of a previous speaker at the fact that referendums will not be held in Member States on the issue of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I come from a jurisdiction in which there will be a referendum and the people will have an opportunity to assess, in a real-life way, how they reckon this project is advancing and developing."
"President-in-Office, in Ireland you caused something of a stir: you were reported in the media as saying that it is important not to launch some discussions that might cause problems in our country."
"This indicates to us that you propose postponing controversial or difficult issues."
"We would like to know what those issues are."
"If we are serious about democracy in the Union, if we are serious about a Union that cares, we certainly have to ensure that full information on policy initiatives and direction are given to the people."
"- (PL) Prime Minister, not long ago you said that the European Union was united not only by a common economy and policy, but also by the values of a common memory, culture and creativity."
"I agree."
"Greetings to you, Prime Minister, from Poland, the land of Adam Mickiewicz."
"That prophet, as the French call him, once asked: Slavs, what can you offer that is new?"
"What do you bring with you to the world stage?"
"His message was that the Christian spirit has particularly penetrated certain European peoples, and all Christian progress also contains within it the progress of nations."
"Europe - the mother of nations - is united by a Christian culture in both the west and the east."
"Here in this Parliament the French President Valéry Giscard D'Estaing told me recently that he was always in favour of including a reference to the Christian God in the European constitution."
"Prime Minister, you are right in saying that the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue is an opportunity for Europe to strengthen itself through culture."
"Jean Monnet, now at rest in the secular Panthéon in Paris, used to say that if he were to start over again, he would start with culture."
"Christian culture and religion, as Professor Tadeusz Zieliński, buried in Schöndorf near Munich, used to say, is expressed in human longing."
"So let Slovenia, that small EU country, express this longing through its actions for the benefit of Christian culture in Europe."
"This is where the greatness of your country in the EU lies; this is where the greatness of our Slavic EU countries lies."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that the Slovenian Presidency wants to deal with the subject of the threat of climate change and with the policy of safe and sustainable energy."
"I think that it is about time we take off the green populist spectacles and free ourselves from the unjustified scare of nuclear reactors."
"We have an opportunity to stop taking money out of the citizens' pockets by immoral trade in emission permits, which are nothing but indulgences for the greatest polluters."
"We have the opportunity to discard ludicrous taxes on fuel particles as well as technical pseudo-solutions, expenditure on which far exceeds their benefit."
"Ladies and gentlemen, according to documented scientific conclusions nuclear energy is the form of energy that does not produce CO2 and minimises the aggravation of climate change."
"It is also the cheapest low-carbon energy, it is reliable and it is safe."
"In addition, nuclear energy reduces a country's dependency on the supply of fuel from unstable territories."
"I am convinced that if we wish to act in the interest of the citizens of the Union and deal with climatic change, we should invest in research, development and education in the field of nuclear energy."
"- (DE) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Slovenian Presidency of the Council on its comprehensive programme, the final phase of the programme of the three Council Presidencies, and also on the successful development of your own country."
"You are part of Schengen, you are part of the euro area, and it really is a historic Council Presidency, of which I make the request that you do not do as all the others before you have done and present a programme that even a large country would not be able to accomplish in six months."
"As a smaller country, you have the solidarity of the larger countries as well as of the European Parliament. My request, however, is that you do not overdo things."
"UN reform will certainly not be possible within six months under a Slovenian Presidency of the Council."
"There are some very pressing problems pending, a few of which you have listed."
"The most difficult will be the Kosovo issue."
"Here, too, you are in a particularly difficult situation."
"Another is the continuing development of the internal energy market, the agreement with Russia - these are the priorities you will in reality be able to address."
"And if you succeed in moving ratification of the Lisbon Treaty forward, then you will be able to say at the end of this six-month Presidency: yes, as the first country from the former communist block, we have managed to shape this Council Presidency as a positive role model for prosperity, freedom and peace."
"Finally, a minor observation for our colleague, Mr Schulz, who is no longer here."
"He talked about the Socialist Group here - in Germany he keeps quiet about this - but we do know he has done so."
"At the end he warned against right-wing radicalism, as though communism might have been a right-wing extremist system!"
"If I quote him correctly, he has also assigned you the task of bringing Turkey's membership forward."
"The Commission has already confirmed that it is dealing with Croatia and Turkey even-handedly."
"Do not get involved!"
"Leave this to the larger states, which have not been able to resolve it to date."
"If you concentrate on the Western Balkans, you'll be doing Europe a great deal of good and you will potentially have a lot more success in this than in trying to resolve Turkey's problems!"
"- (DE) Mr President, Prime Minister, do not be reduced to your role in the Balkans."
"Continue to be a European Presidency!"
"I shall begin, however, with small matters, and I hope that my country, Austria, will also make an effective contribution to your Presidency by solving the outstanding problems concerning the Slovenian minority in Austria and that the Slovenian minority will now finally come into its own."
"As rapporteur for Croatia, I do hope that Croatia will be able to make great progress during your Presidency."
"You must contribute something to this, as must Croatia."
"From you I expect that during your Presidency, you will implement the Treaty that you concluded with Prime Minister Sanader and that a solution will then be found to the disputed borders through appraisal by a third party."
"I expect greater efforts from Croatia and, as regards the ecological fishing zone, I expect the promise to be kept not to extend and apply this zone to Croatia and Italy."
"The greatest problem is certainly that of Kosovo and I am of the opinion that you are going down the right path."
"You are acting with caution, calmly, but purposefully."
"This is the solution to which we aspire in Kosovo because, let's be honest, it is not possible and not reasonable - either for Kosovo or for Serbia - for Kosovo to have a shared existence within Serbia."
"This does not mean, however, that we do not share Serbia's concern and cannot understand why Serbia has great problems here."
"However, one thing should also be stated very clearly for Serbia's ears, specifically to Prime Minister Koštunica: we believe that the future of Serbia, of a democratic Serbia, a Serbia that also cooperates with the ICTY, lies in Europe!"
"If Mr Koštunica believes that Serbia's future lies in Russia, that's his problem, but I do not believe that the population of Serbia would agree with him."
"A clear signal should therefore be sent to Serbia under your Presidency: you must choose between Russia and the European Union on this issue."
"We are making a straightforward offer to the entire region, and specifically to Serbia, to continue on the path towards the European Union in a reasonable period of time."
"This is a massive task to perform and I'm sure you will perform it well!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I want to combine two of the topics for the Spring Summit."
"Firstly, climate change and the climate and energy package."
"Of course, it is very difficult when you have to go from targets to tools."
"This creates a burden on all our Member States."
"Still, this is something we have to do."
"I want to point out two areas where we have to be very cautious when we enter negotiations on this green package."
"The first one is the social issues."
"In this Chamber we have had a lot of debate when it comes to the Lisbon Strategy and to adding economic development to sustainable social development and environmental issues."
"It is very important that sustainable economic development is reflected in the green package when it is delivered next week."
"The second thing is technology neutrality."
"Slovenia is a forestry country, as is my own country, Sweden, and I think it is very important that you have all the different alternative fuels on the table so that you can pick and choose and let innovation get the full potential of the whole thing."
"Do not forget methanol and cellulose!"
"Finally, the Lisbon Strategy has to be a combination of climate and economic development."
"Look at the transport sector, which is a perfect example of how trains and cars can achieve not only economic development and a better internal market, but also the goals of the energy package."
"It is only by starting that the unachievable can become achievable."
"I wish you all the best luck in the world, President-in-Office."
"- (PL) Mr President, Slovenia is the first of the new Member States to take on the Presidency of the European Union."
"This Presidency coincides with the year 2008, which has been designated as the Year of Intercultural Dialogue, so this is one of the main foundations of its programme."
"It should be remembered, though, that such dialogue is possible only when the parties have a strong sense of cultural identity and wish to share this wealth with others."
"The cultural foundation of Europe is Christianity, so Christian values should be promoted and strengthened, and not undermined."
"It is difficult to discern such a positive approach in the most important EU documents that have been passed, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Reform Treaty."
"They contain no references to Europe's Christian roots."
"There has also been no serious debate on this subject in the forum of the European Parliament."
"In this context there must be doubts as to whether the European Union, while neglecting, and thus eroding its own roots, is sufficiently prepared for an intercultural dialogue with strong partners from other regions of the world."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Barroso said, the Slovenian Presidency in itself represents a historic achievement and this allows us to reflect on the relationship between Europe and the Balkans region."
"This has certainly been subject to criticism, partly because of the aspects of disintegration which it has involved, and Europe should now counter this by promoting peace and rapprochement, encouraged by the very relationship with Europe."
"That is why we should avoid unilateral action on Kosovo, on which there should be a common European policy, as the new treaty, in any case, states."
"We need to tackle the problems of the new external borders which have arisen as a result of some countries' accession to the European Union."
"We need an active policy for social, economic and environmental integration which encompasses the entire area, and frankly I do not see nuclear power as a solution to energy problems."
"Finally, I would like to remind the Slovenian Presidency of the problem of the 'erased', that is, those former Yugoslav citizens who still have citizenship problems in Slovenia, so that it may be definitively resolved."
"- (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, we were told very graphically as children how General Tito tore through the streets of Belgrade, people jumping aside - it was closed, no traffic regulations were in force."
"To our youthfully naive way of thinking, this was the epitome of the arbitrariness and ruthlessness of a particular system."
"Later we then noticed how proceedings were arbitrarily initiated against dissidents, against critics in the country from which they were able to escape."
"Now you are here, and your joy is understandable, but be vigilant!"
"The Tito here, in his attitude, for instance, is our Secretary General, Harald Rømer, who tears through this city of Strasbourg and does not fear the consequences even if it is at 100 kilometres an hour and people also have to jump aside."
"And unfortunately there are arbitrary proceedings against unwelcome critics even in this European Union."
"I resolutely reject these attacks against the Secretary General of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, may I warmly welcome the Prime Minister to Parliament and wish him well in his period as President-in-Office of the Council."
"I feel sure that Slovenia will carry out the task ahead with great competence."
"I welcome the emphasis given to the next stage in the Lisbon Strategy."
"There remains much to be done to persuade Member States to reform their economies and I hope that the Presidency will advocate greater liberalisation, reforms to labour markets and ensure European business benefits from globalisation."
"Europe needs to be more competitive, more focused on creating new jobs and less concerned with protecting a social model that hampers employment growth."
"I want to see action on completing the internal market and, in particular, the telecoms sector."
"I welcomed the announcement by the Commissioner last year on further liberalising the telecoms market."
"We now have the opportunity to reassess the existing framework to get rid of bottlenecks and to map out a more competitive future for this crucial industry."
"I look forward to hearing in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, where I am also the PPE-DE Group spokesman, how the Presidency intends to take matters forward."
"I also welcome the commitment to pursue vigorously the energy and climate change agenda."
"The EU has established tough carbon emissions targets and it is now incumbent upon Member States to follow through with real action, and not just words, to ensure burden sharing does not just end up as load shedding."
"I read with concern in the press this week that some Member States are trying to undermine the EU agreement of last year on climate change, and we will pay particular attention to see that the British Government lives up to the commitments it has entered into."
"(NL) Mr President, I would like to return to the situation with regard to Serbia."
"I think that it is a good idea to set up a task force analogous with that for Croatia, as proposed by the Slovenian Presidency, to help Serbia cooperate fully and effectively with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague."
"That could also clear the way - as far as I am concerned - for the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"I would also appeal to the government of my own country, the Netherlands, to cooperate and to support the Slovenian Presidency's proposal, and also to take a look at how well this has worked in the past with Croatia."
"I would like to make a second comment about our neighbourhood policy."
"Ukraine now has a new government, and negotiations are to start on the successor to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with that country."
"We would like to know about the Slovenian Government's proposals and ideas, the form the negotiations should take and the intended result."
"We are not in favour of offering membership to Ukraine at this time - that is definitely not on the table - but it is important to offer the country something more tangible in terms of its links with the European Union."
"I would now like to say a few words about the situation with regard to Georgia, another country covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"Personally, I found the European Union's reaction to the election results and to the elections themselves rather too hasty and rather too positive."
"There were large demonstrations afterwards."
"A discussion is still under way about the irregularities that occurred in the course of the elections."
"What I consider important now is that both the European Union and the Presidency take initiatives to at least foster links between the opposition in that country and President Saakashvili."
"Finally, I would like to comment on the situation with regard to Russia."
"Presidential elections are to be held shortly."
"It appears that the way is clear for the opening of negotiations on a new partnership agreement with the country."
"In our opinion, the whole issue of energy transparency is of particularly great importance in the preparatory negotiations for the new agreement."
"We also want to engage in dialogue with Russia about the quality of democracy in that country, however, and in particular the problems we have experienced recently with election observation and the way we see this versus the way Russia sees it."
"I hope that this subject, too, will be on the Slovenian Presidency's agenda."
"- (PL) Mr President, I think we are anticipating that in 2008 the Slovenian Presidency will enable the European Union to settle the matter of the Constitutional Treaty and make preparations for its ratification, and that it will also enable a solution to be found to one of the awkward problems that Europe faces - the problem of Kosovo."
"I think it is important to say, however, that besides these priorities there are certain tasks that favour them."
"I would request that intercultural dialogue be seen as one such task."
"I think that it lies among the values that create European unity, and that it also underlies a certain geopolitical value that EU policy may have."
"It seems to me that in this particular context Europe may play the role of a bringer of peace in a situation in which the world appears to be in a state of international disarray."
"I would further add that where Kosovo is concerned, it is exceptionally important for the problem of intercultural dialogue to be its context."
"This will be the problem of the future for Kosovo."
"Prime Minister, I wish the Slovenian Presidency success."
"- (PL) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, I congratulate Slovenia on its Presidency of the Union and I wish Slovenia success, especially in ratifying the new treaty."
"Little Slovenia has got in ahead of great big Poland, and that should be food for thought for us Poles."
"Perhaps through Slovenia's example we will see a reduction in our fear of the Union and an increase in our faith that it makes sense."
"After all, you, sir, are the second Slav, after John Paul II, to come to lead the culture of the whole of Europe, including its western part."
"After its expansion in 2004, the Union looked forward to an influx of fresh blood, new brains and a new outlook, and through your proposal of a fifth freedom for the Union - the free movement of knowledge - you are meeting that expectation."
"Your country, once a part of the former Yugoslavia, with its awareness of the problems of the worlds of Christianity and Islam, will certainly provide the impetus for a fair outcome for Kosovo, with respect for the rights of Serbs."
"(SL) It is with joy and pride that I am sharing with you festive feelings accompanied, of course, by a strong feeling of responsibility and great opportunities."
"I am convinced that Slovenia will also show through the Presidency that its inauguration, years ago, was not just a geo-political decision, but also an acknowledgement that we were willing to cooperate responsibly in the creation of a free, democratic and successfully united Europe."
"I strongly support the ambition to implement the Lisbon strategy, which is crucial for our future."
"In this sense I expect that Slovenia will do everything for advancement of the common policy in telecommunications and information technology."
"That is essential for implementation of the Lisbon strategy, not only because of the contribution to the essential increase in competitiveness, but also to get closer to the citizens."
"The citizens of Europe like to feel the common policy in their pockets and we were successful with the directive on roaming, which enables us to phone cheaper within Europe; the common policy in this area will certainly make it possible for us to feel the benefit of such policies more often."
"My second emphasis is in the area of health."
"I am very pleased, and I am not the only one in this Parliament, that the priorities of the Slovenian Presidency also include the fight against cancer."
"It should become a permanent item on the agenda of the European Council."
"Cancer is not only a matter for Health Ministers."
"Every third citizen of Europe can expect to contract this disease and the trends are not promising."
"It is a wide social and political question that is also connected with implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"If increasing numbers of people become ill, we will not be able to achieve higher productivity and better competitiveness."
"Health is a vision, a dimension, and not just an activity sector."
"I will be pleased if we achieve two things during the Slovenian Presidency."
"Firstly, more attention should be paid to prevention in the fight against cancer, and secondly, interinstitutional working groups for the fight against cancer should be established."
"This fight requires good, united coordination between the European parliament, the Council and the European Commission."
"President of the Council, I wish you a successful Presidency."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Prime Minister, with your Presidency the new Member States have taken a new step on the road towards coming of age."
"It is likely that your Presidency will contribute to melting the reservations that have never existed in the European institutions but which have been present in the everyday life of the European Union."
"You have the first Presidency in the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"Our region knows that, next to the big red blob on our globe, Eastern Central Europe became a blob that was painted pink, but this region has never been all the same colour."
"This region has always preserved its historical multicolour and diversity."
"This is particularly well known in the Western Balkans, since Yugoslavia papered over the dividing lines, but could not bridge them."
"It is therefore no accident that we struggle the most with rethinking and reinforcing our national, linguistic and cultural identity, and we expect you to help us with this, since your Presidency can help in rebuilding an identity that is now inseparable from the consciousness of European citizens."
"The opportunity and duty for the Slovenian Presidency is taking further steps to take the region's European mission and enlargement into a new phase."
"Slovenia is the gateway to the Western Balkans, and Europe's path leads through this gateway."
"The Member States' enlargement fatigue cannot become reform fatigue in this region, since it would endanger the stability of our region."
"Finally, concerning the Reform Treaty, I am proud that Hungary was the first to ratify the Reform Treaty."
"Although there are only very few matters in which political agreement can be reached in Hungary today, Europe has been one of them."
"Our region needs a Europe that works more and works better, and we are sure of the cooperation and help of the Slovenian Presidency."
"I wish you great success in your Presidency."
"- (DE) Mr President, the Alps are important this year for Europe."
"Slovenia has the Presidency of the European Council, Switzerland and Austria are hosting the European football championships and all eyes are on the mountains."
"I congratulate the Presidency on taking over the official functions."
"It is an important Presidency."
"The Lisbon ratification process is quite rightly your first priority."
"The ESDP is being put to the test in Kosovo."
"In Parliament we are looking to you to make clear to us - if we don't manage to achieve a Security Council resolution - that Resolution 1244 is a watertight legal basis for all ESDP measures."
"My Group Chairman has said: we are against an accelerated stabilisation and association agreement for Serbia without cooperation with the ICTY."
"We celebrate the fact that Slovenia is the first Member State from the accession countries to take over the Presidency."
"We Liberals have always fought strongly for this enlargement."
"We have also advocated it whenever we encountered antagonism at home."
"We do not feel very much like celebrating at the moment, however."
"I am from North Rhine-Westphalia and learnt from 2 300 people in Bochum yesterday that Nokia are closing their production facilities and will be relocating to Romania."
"The impression was then created that it was happening with EU money."
"I want to make it crystal clear for the FDP that the relocation of jobs within the European Union must not be facilitated with EU funds!"
"We shall be doing everything we can to ensure that no EU subsidies are flowing in this case."
"I see that the President of the Commission is nodding."
"I hope that we get a clear response to this from the Commission."
"This is a very important subject, which scares people and makes them afraid of Europe."
"This should not be!"
"We shall also ensure that eligibility for assistance is checked if national subsidies are directed into Romania."
"This is a problem and we hope that the skilled and motivated people in Bochum will soon find work again."
"- (PL) Prime Minister, you have my sympathy and commiserations."
"Following your entry into the euro area, inflation in your country is 100% higher than it was a year ago."
"Despite this, as Commissioner Almunia said two months ago, Commission President, you have conceded that this rise in inflation is one of the consequences of accession to Euroland."
"One of your stated priorities is the matter of Kosovo."
"Please bear in mind that its independence would be the first unilateral alteration of boundaries in Europe since the Second World War."
"This is exactly what Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia are looking for, but Moscow is also interested in destabilising the situation in the South Caucasus."
"This may actually threaten war in that region, and the greatest military conflict in Europe since the Balkans flare-up of the early 1990s."
"Clearly we must respect the right of the Kosovars to self-determination."
"(ES) Mr President, I wish the Slovenian Presidency well."
"It is an excellent symbol of the transformation of the European Union."
"Some very important matters will be dealt with over the next six months, and I will mention a few."
"Firstly, there is the Spring European Council, which will focus on the Lisbon Strategy."
"The truth is that we are in a difficult economic situation: growth forecasts are declining as a result of the financial crisis, rising inflation, the strength of the euro and a very weak dollar, and the extremely high price of oil."
"Food prices are also rising."
"The public expect effective decisions that will help restore confidence in a time of uncertainty."
"Externally there is the issue of Kosovo, which affects such important principles as the stability of borders throughout Europe."
"Do not be hasty."
"I think that the December European Council acted rather hastily."
"It took decisions such as sending a civilian mission, but apparently with no agreement on the legal basis."
"It is paradoxical that this is happening in the EU, a community based on the rule of law."
"The issue of Kosovo is a delicate one, requiring caution."
"Try hard to achieve a fresh Security Council resolution."
"In May, as you mentioned, there will be the important Lima Summit with the Latin American countries, which are so close to Europe in terms of principles and values."
"Lima should also be used as a lever to break the deadlock in the negotiations with Mercosur and to drive forward the negotiations with the Andean countries and Central America on their respective association agreements."
"In March the expansion of the Schengen area will be a reality at airports."
"This is a decisive time for the EU's external borders, which brings me to the fight against illegal immigration."
"A meeting is planned between the ministers responsible for border control, which I think is very timely."
"There is a need for increased cooperation between those ministers, and the officials looking after external borders need to be fully aware that they are doing not only a national job, but also a European one, and that they share responsibility for what happens throughout the Schengen area."
"Finally, I would also ask you to work on the fight against terrorism."
"The public expect the European Union to produce results in this area that is so significant and important for their lives."
"(BG) Mr. President, Mr. Barroso, Mr. Janša, I cannot fail to note that the Slovenian Presidency is a very important sign to European citizens and in particular for the citizens in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Slovenia has the opportunity to bring them all the self-confidence of being truly equal stakeholders in the European process."
"We know Slovenia as a country which addressed, without much ado, persistently and consistently, the big issues of its transition and today has every reason to be referred to as 'Eastern Europe's best performer'."
"This was made possible through the political consensus in that country."
"This is exactly what we expect from the Slovenian Presidency: to push on, without any flourish of trumpets or big promises, in dealing with issues that are key to the European Union's future as highlighted in the programmed presented."
"You have every chance of achieving this because today's discussion showed both political and institutional consensus in your support."
"I believe that the Slovenian Presidency comes at the right time, especially in view of the challenges related to the Western Balkans."
"Slovenia's historical and political experience will enable the European Union to be more effective in its policy towards these countries."
"They need a new impetus to continue reforms and speed up their progress towards the European Union."
"A goal entirely within reach as Slovenia, a former constituent republic of Yugoslavia, has shown in practice."
"I believe that through Slovenia, the European Union will speak in a voice more understandable for many of the Western Balkan nations."
"In both the direct sense of the word, and figuratively."
"I feel I must mention that for the first time the Council will be speaking a Slavic language."
"It seems to me that no one else could deal more successfully with the 'Kosovo issue' than Slovenia."
"The risks faced by the entire region are huge, and that is why our expectations of you, Mr. Janša, are also high."
"We expect you to succeed in preserving the unity of the European Union, both in regard to the resolution on the status of the province and in regard to the commitment of the Union in the difficult period thereafter."
"Mr. Janša, for us, Socialists, it is important that the Slovenian Presidency be a success, and we will not just sit aside and observe, we will yield our real support for your efforts as best as we can and as far as our powers go, so that you can implement your programme."
"I wish you success, so that you can prove that a small country can be big in Europe."
"(IT) Mr President, Prime Minister Janša, ladies and gentlemen, welcome, Prime Minister, on behalf of that radical party and those comrades who rushed to achieve your release, with the comrades and friends of the Mladina magazine, in late 1988."
"You were in prison for the sake of democracy and for the sake of Europe."
"Today you find yourself President of a European Union which is eliminating and abolishing the anthem and the flag, which with the Eurogroup is even distorting - please note this, Prime Minister - the traditional geopolitical borders on our European coins."
"You are in favour of enlargement, but this is the same Europe that was deaf to the tragedy in Yugoslavia, and today is deaf to Turkey and all the enlargements that we hope for."
"We - myself included - were also at Ljubljana when the Serbian air raids took place."
"At that time we met with Mr Skolk, with the young people of the AZMSS, with President Kučan and even with our friend Mr Kacin."
"At that time you were fighting for a Europe other than the Europe that was betraying you, which wanted to see a neutral Yugoslavia because it was convenient for it."
"Welcome."
"If, on behalf of your country, Slovenia, you are going to be what you have been, then you will be the one here standing for the Europe of Altiero Spinelli, not we who represent Europe, not we who often represent its disintegration."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"- (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the night between 20 and 21 December 2007 we extended the Schengen border."
"We gained a bit more freedom again and came another step closer to each other."
"The barbed wire has finally been removed and Slovenia took over the Presidency of the Council of a reunited Europe on 1 January."
"As a European, but particularly as an Austrian, a friend, a neighbour and an ally, I am very pleased about this."
"President-in-Office of the Council, this debate revolves around six items."
"Firstly, the fact that you hold the Presidency has more than merely symbolic value."
"It makes us aware of historic developments that for many have either already become self-evident or are unfortunately seen as a threat."
"Secondly, the ratification process started in Hungary."
"You need to structure and galvanise the process and provide sufficient coordinated information to the citizens of Europe."
"Thirdly, please use the targets for climate change and greater European energy independence to provide further impetus for growth, employment and social cohesion when implementing the Lisbon Strategy."
"Fourthly, your geographical position, experience of history and the timing of your Presidency give you special responsibility in terms of Croatia's accession, freedom for Kosovo and the agreement with Serbia."
"Fifthly, we are embarking with you on the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"Let this Presidency be one of cooperation, of mutual respect, thoughtfulness towards one another and mutual understanding."
"The sixth and final item: do not confuse your European responsibility with the bilateral issues to be resolved or Austria's responsibility towards the Slovenian minority in Austria."
"Bilateral treaties between two Member States do not fall within the European Union's remit."
"(FR) President-in-Office, you have come before us with modesty."
"You have even mentioned potential errors, and admitted to possible naivety."
"Within the context of the Troika, I suggest you pass on this sense of humility to the French President, who will succeed you."
"I have just one message for you: teach Europe some of the best lessons from your history."
"You are Celts - me too!"
"You have been dominated by Bavaria, coveted by the Republic of Venice, incorporated into the Austro-Hungarian Empire, occupied by Napoleon - my apologies for that one - divided up between Germany, Italy and Hungary and integrated into the Yugoslav Federation, and you have been independent since your referendum in 1990."
"What a history!"
"Who is better placed than you to talk about intercultural dialogue?"
"Who has greater credibility than you to do so?"
"So make it a higher priority."
"You have placed it fourth; I suggest you move it up a rung or two!"
"Having said that, please do not restrict intercultural dialogue to interreligious dialogue."
"Also think about the contribution to Europe made by those who believe that religion and politics should not be mixed, because history has shown that when one meddles with the other, it always leads to problems."
"To conclude, if you would permit me, in the spirit of what I have just said, I would like to read a short passage from your national anthem to our fellow Members, because it is beautiful!"
"'God's blessing on all nations, Who long and work for that bright day, When o'er earth's habitation no war, no strife shall hold its sway;"
"Who long to see, that all men free no more shall foes but neighbours be'."
"That is the spirit of your Presidency, and that is the spirit of Europe."
"I am French, and I am not going to give up the Marseillaise, but for six months I am very happy to be Slovenian!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr Poignant, listening to you singing the Marseillaise or even the European anthem would certainly be a great pleasure."
"- (PL) Prime Minister, the aims you have stated for your Presidency include the Treaty, the Strategy, the climate, energy, the Western Balkans, and if we add to this intercultural dialogue, that will be quite a lot for this small country, following the great success on which I congratulate you and all the Slovenian people."
"At the last meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Foreign Minister Luís Amado made no mention whatsoever of the Eastern dimension, while you have addressed it only in the most general terms, but I think that it is one of the aims, and particularly as a representative of the Slav countries, you should have a better appreciation of the Eastern dimension of the Slav countries than even the Portuguese have - not that I have any complaints in this regard."
"The question is whether enlargement, as in the forecast made now by the French, prior to their Presidency, will concern mainly the Western Balkans, or maybe something more."
"I would like you to clarify your views on this."
"A second matter is that your country's Presidency coincides with the pre-election period for the European Parliament and, as we know, a turnout of just over 20% of European citizens is not very big and the trend is for it to get smaller."
"Do you have anything to offer in this regard?"
"How will you convince Europeans that this edifice is a good one and that participation in it is worthwhile?"
"And the last matter I wish to raise, which is linked to the first, is that the Slovenian Ambassador to Ukraine has said that Ukraine should enter or will enter the free trade zone during this Presidency."
"This would, of course, be good; there are just a few conditions there that would need to be met, such as the approval of the Duma and properly functioning borders."
"In what way will the Presidency assist Ukraine in this process?"
"And, Mr President, I wanted to finish by saying that:"
"You have the power and the responsibility to control speaking time and I'm asking that you do so in the future."
"(FR) President-in-Office, during a presidency, there are some subjects you can choose and others that gatecrash the party, like security in the Middle East, or Iran."
"In this regard, Iran's nuclear dossier is part of a complex process that touches on security in the Middle East and the Muslim world."
"To restore trust, we need to talk about Iraq, Palestine, Lebanon, extremists, human rights and poverty."
"Many of the region's inhabitants are living on less than two dollars a day."
"Is this acceptable?"
"I am not speaking from a moral point of view, but from a security one."
"These people end up becoming extremists because they have nothing to lose and feel humiliated."
"Nobody is born a suicide bomber, nobody is born a terrorist."
"We have to create an environment that will enable everyone to live with dignity, in peace and freedom."
"These are not my words, they are the words of Mohamed El Baradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency and a Nobel Peace Prize winner."
"They imply that the beginnings of a relationship of trust should be established with the Arab world, in particular Iran, that it should not exclude any inflammatory subjects - neither that country's shocking revisionism regarding the Holocaust, nor the security of Israel - and that it should be conducted on the basis of mutual respect and dignity."
"Does the Slovenian Presidency want to take up these words?"
"Most of all, does it really think it may one day be possible to denuclearise the region by avoiding any mention of the taboo that is Israel's nuclear programme?"
"(RO) Prime Minister, I would like to congratulate you on addressing us today as President of the Council."
"Slovenia has the admiration of the other European nations for its remarkable development since 1990 and for meeting the standards for accession - be they negotiation chapters, adoption of the single currency, or the Presidency of the Council."
"I would also like to congratulate you on defining the priorities of the EU for the next 6 months, in cooperation wth the German and Portuguese governments."
"Undoubtedly, it is desirable that the Lisbon Treaty, which puts and end to a prolonged identity crisis in the European Union, be ratified as soon as possible and acknowledged as an authentic democratic act by all European citizens."
"At the same time, it is also desirable that the goals of the Lisbon Strategy should be put into practice as soon as possible, because we are facing a wave of pessimism among the citizens concerning this policy."
"The latest European Commission Eurobarometer of December 2007 indicates a relative drop in citizens' confidence in both of the Strategy's components: economic growth and employment."
"Unemployment remains a major concern for European citizens, although there has been significant improvement compared with 2006."
"With the new cycle starting in 2008 for the Lisbon Strategy, the European Parliament will adopt an action plan concerning workforce mobility, in order to strengthen employment at European level."
"However, there is still the issue of restricted access to the European labour market, affecting over 100 million European citizens."
"I therefore urge you, Prime-Minister, to support the initiatives of the Parliamentt and the European Commission concerning free access to the labour market."
"I firmly believe that in this way Europe will secure its economic future by safeguarding the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaty."
"(IT) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as an Italian I would like to welcome particularly warmly the fact that Slovenia holds the Presidency of the Council; that, of the countries who have recently joined the European Union, it falls to Slovenia to be the first to hold the Presidency; and that Slovenia is now in the Schengen area together with other European countries."
"As holder of the Presidency, your fundamental task is to give a strong impetus to the process of ratifying the Lisbon Treaty."
"This is a treaty that will enable this Parliament to have greater co-decision powers, that will make it possible to take decisions by qualified majority on some absolutely strategic issues and all within sectors where the fundamental rights of citizens will be given more attention and more protection: I am thinking of judicial cooperation and legal immigration."
"Our suggestion is directed to this end, and we will have to attempt over the coming months to find room for an interinstitutional agreement to regulate the transitional stage on various issues: I am thinking, for instance, of the Europol package to be voted on tomorrow, and tomorrow this Parliament will ask you to make an undertaking for the Council to consult the European Parliament once again within six months of the entry into force of the treaties in the light of the new legal provisions that these treaties will offer us."
"Again, on the common immigration policy I would ask for your commitment to a secure framework, as illegal immigration can only be combated while respecting fundamental rights with tenacity, conviction and accuracy, partly in order to avoid a recurrence of what happened a few months ago when hundreds of human beings clung to tuna nets in a vain attempt to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe."
"- (LV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate Slovenia on being the first new Member State to hold the EU Presidency."
"I believe that other new Member States, when preparing for their presidencies, will be able to learn a lot from Slovenia's experience."
"Certainly, one of the most important tasks of the Slovenian Presidency is to promote a successful ratification process for the Lisbon Treaty."
"For my part, I can announce that Latvia plans to ratify the Lisbon Treaty in May, during the Slovenian Presidency."
"The Slovenian Presidency's undertaking to strengthen the EU's role as a global leader in combating climate change and the use of renewable energy is to be welcomed."
"For several years climate change and energy problems have been a focus of attention for the public and politicians."
"It is, however, important that this priority is not only expressed as a fine undertaking, but can also be reflected as a priority in the EU budget."
"In view of the fact that work should begin on the mid-term review of the Financial Perspective this year, it would be important to hear the Slovenian Presidency's thoughts about possible EU budget priorities within the context of the mid-term review."
"I think that climate change and energy issues ought to be among these priorities, including directing a larger portion of the EU Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund towards increasing energy efficiency and fostering the use of renewable energy."
"The Slovenian Presidency's undertaking to pay more attention to the western Balkans, including the Kosovo issue, is understandable."
"The view expressed by Slovenia's prime minister, however - that the security situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina might be worse than in Kosovo - has met an equivocal reaction."
"Therefore, it would be important to have a precise understanding of the Slovenian Presidency's position concerning the state of affairs in the Balkans and its proposals for stabilising the situation."
"Thank you for your attention, and I wish the Slovenian Presidency every success in its work."
"(NL) The President-in-Office of the Council bears the important responsibility of launching a new cycle of the Lisbon process at the forthcoming Spring Summit."
"To be frank, my group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, takes the view that the proposals presented to us by the President of the Commission in December lack ambition."
"It is true, of course, that the previous cycle of the Lisbon Strategy created growth and jobs, but it is also true that Europe is now required to function in the context of accelerated globalisation and new world players."
"The Socialist Group is convinced, therefore, that Europe will only be able to continue to play its role if it puts the maximum focus on sustainable development, on research and innovation, on investment in people; in short, on quality rather than low costs or low standards."
"It is also clear to us that this needs to involve everyone in Europe."
"Lisbon did not prevent a situation in which 78 million people risk descending into poverty and in which a large proportion of the jobs created are precarious and do not offer a decent income."
"Therefore, Lisbon cannot succeed without genuine reinforcement of the social dimension."
"This requires more than comments, Commission President; it must occupy a visible, prominent position in the guidelines and in an ambitious social agenda."
"President-in-Office of the Council, we are counting on the Slovenian Presidency to make this clear at the Spring Summit."
"- (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I, too, am happy that Slovenia is taking over the Presidency of the Council."
"I was this Parliament's general rapporteur for the enlargement round of the 12 countries and now seeing a country from this line-up take over the Presidency for the first time personally gives me great pleasure."
"Slovenia is also the most successful of the new Member States, as a member of both the Schengen area and the euro area, and has proved that these new countries get on very well in Europe."
"And it must be said that small countries are often the most successful as regards the Presidency of the Council because they get fully involved in this business."
"I therefore wish you every success with it."
"You have a multifaceted array of tasks ahead of you."
"You have to see through and deliver ratification of the crucial Lisbon Treaty and you must already be preparing to implement this Treaty, which is at least as important."
"You have a difficult problem ahead of you with Kosovo, and you have an exceptional opportunity to sort this out for us because you know this region very well."
"However, this also shows that the European Union is often pushed on foreign policy issues so that we are played off against the Americans and Russians."
"When I see that at the same time as we are discussing strategies for Central Asia, and Gazprom is concluding gas contracts with Kazakhstan, then I have to say that we are not really taking strategic action on issues that are crucial for our future and I think that perhaps something needs to be improved here."
"Please allow me one final comment."
"I too, coming as I do from North Rhine-Westphalia, would be grateful to the President of the Commission if he were able to provide clarification on the subject of Nokia."
"Relocations may, of course, take place."
"To put it clearly, Germany, more than almost any other country, gains extensive benefits from the European internal market or an enlarged European internal market, but it is very difficult to make this clear to those concerned if the loss of their jobs was facilitated with European funds or if unlawful national subsidies were used for this."
"We therefore request clarification on this because if these rumours were to be repeated, great harm would be done to the European concept."
"- (EL) Mr President, the Slovenian Presidency is very fortunate to be following on from two successful presidencies."
"Slovenia is also the first of the 12 new Member States to take on the Presidency, and this makes its responsibility all the greater."
"The Slovenian Presidency's programme undoubtedly contains worthy elements."
"For my part, however, I believe that greater weight ought to have been given to the attempt to achieve greater understanding and acceptance by the public both of the Reform Treaty and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The Slovenian Presidency supports the plans for the accession of the Western Balkan States."
"This is also the position of my delegation, but, as experience has taught us, it should be borne in mind that the premature setting of the date for the commencement of accession negotiations can lead to deadlock."
"We should also very seriously consider that the overwhelming weight of European public opinion appears to be particularly cautious about any further expansion, and this is something that we cannot ignore."
"We must all be particularly careful on the subject of Kosovo."
"We should realise that a power game is being played in the region."
"On the one hand, US policy seeks to fully control the whole region, while Russia for its part wants to maintain contact with a region with which traditionally and for centuries it has maintained special relations."
"In this game Kosovo is like a ping-pong ball."
"At the recent Summit Meeting the European leaders did not take a decision on whether they would recognise a unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo."
"Let us hope that we shall all weigh up the dangers inherent in unilateral recognition and act with particular care, because unsuccessful manoeuvres might set off chain reactions in the wider region, with unforeseen consequences."
"Mr President, I am told that, when Slovenia opened its borders recently, the crowd there compared notes on how much they had smuggled across during the Communist days, even to the extent of having a model confessional box there for anyone who confessed their sins, who was then rewarded with coffee and brandy, so I can understand why President Barroso rushed to be part of these celebrations!"
"But, Prime Minister, you gave us, initially, a moving account of your country and indeed your own history."
"You talked with pride of Slovenia and you talked with some emotion of your experience in the prison cell."
"I hope that those are the emotions you will bring to the Presidency - the belief in human rights and the determination that Europe shall have that pride too."
"There are two areas that I want to raise with you as you do that."
"One is on our environment, because alongside human rights and our Lisbon Agenda goes a clean environment, a healthy environment and, indeed, a healthy people."
"That environment needs to move on from Bali, which was a great talking shop."
"We now need the action."
"We need real action, realistic action, and that must start next week with our climate change package."
"On the health field, we need legal certainty on cross-border health."
"There is a great new opportunity for Europe's citizens - its patients - if we get this right."
"We waited and had this delayed."
"That must wait no longer."
"We must make sure, please, that it now comes forward."
"If we do not, it is not an option to do nothing."
"The alternative is that the lawyers go on making policy for us."
"Thirdly, on that, I ask you to pay particular attention to mental health."
"If there is any criticism of Slovenia I have, it is the slowness with which it has enacted its mental health laws."
"Now you have an opportunity to lead on mental health following the Green Paper and I hope you will take that up."
"You are a small country, a proud country, and the small countries of Europe are usually the best Presidents of the European Union."
"I wish you success in that. I have confidence that Slovenia, under your leadership, will meet that pride in success and achievement by the time you finish in six months' time."
"We still have another 10 minutes' 'catch the eye', each with a minute at the most."
"(SL) The many good wishes addressed to Slovenia as the first of the new Member States to take over the Presidency of the Council indicate that the activities of Slovenia will attract special attention."
"The expectations are great and so is the responsibility."
"People outside the political institutions in the new Member States often think that the Union is led by just a few of the large countries."
"This is where Slovenia has an exceptional opportunity to prove that the Union consists of 27 States which together are responsible for shaping the common policy."
"In implementing the priorities and the inherited agenda, I expect Slovenia to pay great attention to cohesion and the reduction of differences in Europe."
"In this short minute I would like to mention climate change and the energy policy, because Europe has set extremely ambitious aims for itself to develop into a society with low carbon emissions."
"And that is what is important: a society with low carbon emissions."
"I would like Slovenia to put forward some concrete proposals and projects and to achieve results in that area."
"- (PL) Mr President, Prime Minister, Slovenia's Presidency is facing many ambitious tasks."
"At the forefront of these ambitious tasks is ratification of the Treaty."
"You will be the watchman, you will have the entire procedure in your hands."
"I therefore have a request, and that is to spare a thought, please, for those countries which have not adopted the Charter of Fundamental Rights, those who have opted out."
"It is a fact that Poland and Great Britain have opted out, but I am certain that these two countries will realise that they have made a mistake and will want to adopt the Charter."
"They will want to offer their citizens the Charter."
"They must be given help in this, and so I am calling on you to make provision for a simplified return procedure, a procedure that will be easy and quick, that will be an opt-in and will not require further ratifications."
"The success of a Presidency, Prime Minister, is generally inversely proportional to the size of the country."
"I am sure you will apply this principle."
"(SL) Prime Minister, I welcome the points which you devoted to human rights today."
"As a liberal MP from Slovenia and a former journalist, I am of the opinion that freedom of expression and freedom of the press are the two most important human rights."
"For that reason I would like to use this solemn occasion to point out the great seriousness of the petition with which a quarter of Slovenian journalists are protesting against the overt and covert pressure they are experiencing."
"The public discrediting of the signatories using their statements taken out of context, with the intention of portraying them as untrustworthy people, is an inopportune act."
"In my opinion, it is a duty of the Presidency of the European Union to ensure that its representatives deal with the content of the statements and evidence in the petition."
"- (EL) Mr President, our greatest concern regarding the proposals for a solution for Kosovo relates to the attempt to place a unilateral declaration of independence on a legal footing, and this would have momentous consequences for international law."
"The recognition of Kosovan independence outside the framework of the United Nations, by means of a unilateral declaration, would constitute a dangerous development; it would perhaps lead to further bloodshed and a redrawing of the borders."
"We believe that, as a very clear infringement of international law, it would also be used in other conflict situations as a method of resolving disputes."
"Perhaps this could also happen in the case of EU Member States such as Cyprus."
"The situation in Kosovo is a continuation and a result of interventionist policies and is a problem that can be resolved only within the framework of the UN and existing international law, without external intervention and infringement of the principles of its very charter."
"The impact of measures that are taken unilaterally can currently be seen in Iraq."
"It is only by means of legal, agreed political solutions that peace can be ensured."
"Mr President, I join my colleagues in welcoming the Prime Minister here today."
"President-in-Office, what a journey in 20 years: from languishing in jail to Prime Minister of the Republic of Slovenia, to President-in-Office of the European Council, and now a member, as you tell us, of the EU, NATO, the euro zone and the Schengen area."
"It is true that the current Balkan situation represents unfinished business; peace in the region is very important to all of us."
"Thank you particularly for your sensitive handling of the forthcoming Irish referendum needed for the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Perhaps I could add to our referendum slogan your words in your concluding remarks when you said: 'I care about Europe because Europe cares about me'."
"What better slogan for the Irish referendum!"
"We can take nothing for granted - it will be hard to deliver - but, believe you me, the Fine Gael Party, of which I am a member, our leader and all the Members of the European Parliament will leave no stone unturned to ensure a 'yes' outcome to the referendum of the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland."
"Thank you, and we look forward to delivering it to you during your Presidency."
"Mr President, as a Finn I am a big fan of ski-jumping, and - to use an allegory - I would say to the Prime Minister that the task of the Slovenian Presidency is like the Planica hill, the instruments that you have are like Elan skis and I hope you have the willpower of Primož Peterka."
"I think that this is going to be a successful Presidency for three reasons: one, you have prepared extremely well; two - and we heard it in your speech today - you are extremely humble; and three, you are very businesslike."
"That is a recipe for success."
"You have three big tasks."
"If you can pull them off at the end of the Presidency, I think you have done it."
"One, the Treaty: if you have got a lot of Member States to ratify without problems, you have done a great job; two, the energy package: if you have got some of that done, you have done a great job; and three, if you have succeeded with Kosovo, you have done it."
"I think the Slovenian Presidency is going to be one of the best ones that we have seen for a long time."
"Good luck!"
"Mr President, Slovenia is the first Member State which, having suffered under totalitarian Communism, can now take the lead in Europe as a whole."
"Therefore it is your historic challenge and chance, Prime Minster, to take the lead also in promoting integration of different historic experiences, to create a united and balanced perception of our history as a common European history."
"I think you, and all of us, need to be confident that the mass murders which happened under Communism will never be repeated again."
"This can only happen if, in Europe as a whole, we pass the same moral and political verdict on totalitarian Communism as was passed on Nazism."
"Two more speakers have come forward, both from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which was the group most strongly opposed to the 'catch-the-eye' system."
"In this respect it is interesting as to who makes the most use of it."
"(SV) Mr President, first let me offer my heartfelt congratulations to Slovenia and wish you all the best for the Presidency."
"Janez Janša, a colleague of mine, has already put a question regarding your statement that the security situation in Bosnia is worse than that in Kosovo."
"I want to be sure that you really answer this question."
"I therefore ask it again: on what do you base this assertion?"
"For it is quite simply not the case."
"By making this statement you showed not only a lack of information but also a lack of diplomacy."
"If the situation had been so complicated in Bosnia and worse than in Kosovo, your statement would have been positively dangerous."
"I therefore expect an answer."
"(DE) Mr President, Prime Minister, we have various projects that are very important for us, including the 'Research on Small and Medium-sized Enterprises' project."
"I would ask that the Council's conclusions insist that we are able to complete this at first reading because I believe that this is a pressing concern for our small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The second point is that energy efficiency in production and consumption should be for us a focus of the debate."
"A large number of jobs can be created here."
"The Lisbon Agenda for new jobs and employment is very important for us all."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for the debate, questions, proposals and suggestions with such lively and interesting content."
"Much of what has been said will happily be considered in the next six months."
"I was pleased with your support for our priorities and especially touched when I heard the Slovenian national anthem being quoted, not by one of my Slovenian colleagues but by a colleague from France, and also when Slovenian products were mentioned, such as Elan skis, etc. In short, I enjoyed listening to the debate and I will be happy to answer some questions."
"Sadly, time will not permit me to answer them all."
"Ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon is certainly one of the key political priorities of the European Union in 2008."
"We were particularly aware of the importance of the Treaty in the period before it was signed."
"At that time, everybody was talking about a crisis."
"Now that the Treaty has been signed, it is still just as important, although it has not yet been ratified, and this is where our responsibility lies."
"More precisely, it is a concrete responsibility of every Member State to bring about the ratification in accordance with procedures laid down by its national constitution or legislation."
"If possible, this should be done within an agreed deadline."
"We do not wish to interfere in the internal affairs of any country, either as a Member State or as the State holding the Presidency for these six months."
"Some countries in particular misconstrued some of the statements."
"We never asserted otherwise and we always appealed for solidarity in discussing sensitive issues that may affect the process of ratification in those Members States where this topic may sometimes even be controversial."
"The progress of the European Union does not begin with the Slovenian Presidency and we are convinced that it will continue in all areas."
"The stated priorities were not mentioned in any particular order in the sense that we would approach one when we had completed the previous one."
"We will attempt to accomplish as much as possible in all the areas listed as priorities, as well as in the others."
"I am pleased that the President of the European Commission was somewhat more specific on points where I had run out of time."
"Certainly, the environment and energy package will be one of the key challenges in the next six months and up to the end of this year."
"We must demonstrate in practice that our aims, set out in March last year, were intended seriously."
"I would like to emphasise once more that I have no doubt that healthy economic growth is the only basis of prosperity."
"Certainly, that must be a priority."
"The Lisbon strategy is clear about that, and I would like to emphasise that the story does not end there."
"This is where the story of social justice begins and both stories are important."
"However, we must recognise that we first have to create before we can share equitably."
"As regards the most frequently raised questions relating to the situation in the western Balkans, I would like to answer some very specific questions and firstly those relating to the legal foundations of the solution to this problem."
"We would not like the European Union to start a long discussion about the legal foundations, which of them are stronger and which weaker, once we have reached the end of a long search for concordant solutions."
"There is absolutely no need for Europe to be divided on this issue just because other bodies are divided."
"The unity of the European Union in solving this problem will be one of our priorities."
"I would like to remind you that a similar question and discussions about legal foundations in the mid-90's of the last century led to more than 100,000 deaths in Bosnia and Herzegovina and one million people being displaced."
"It is difficult to make up that lost time, but we can learn something from it."
"Bosnia and Herzegovina was never said to be a bigger security problem than Kosovo."
"However, what was said was that in some aspects it was a very serious problem, for instance the return of the refugees."
"In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are still many refugees who have not been able to return to their homes."
"Many things that need to be done in that country have been planned, but they cannot be implemented until the refugees have returned to their homes."
"That is one of the challenges awaiting us and I am afraid that some of the things said about it have been misinterpreted."
"Therefore, Ladies and Gentlemen, President of the Parliament, President of the Commission, the priorities presented are our common challenge."
"I am pleased with your support in realising them together."
"Once more I would like to emphasise the significance of the cooperation and synergy which we can achieve with the joint participation of all three key institutions of the European Union - the European Parliament, the European Commission and, of course, the Council."
"We will do everything in our power to maximise that synergy."
"I am looking forward to being here with you on many occasions during the Slovenian Presidency and to fruitful and, as we have already seen, very lively discussions with you."
"(Applause)"
"President-in-Office of the Council, my sincere thanks to you for the cogent introduction to your programme for the Slovenian Presidency."
"All contributions to the debate from the responsible group chairmen and other Members have created the impression that you can count on the enormous and unreserved support of the European Parliament."
"On behalf of us all I sincerely wish you every success in your work."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for this very interesting debate, where I think there was a very large consensus supporting the priorities that were presented by the Slovenian Presidency."
"During my first statement I highlighted some - because I could not go into detail on all aspects - of the priorities for our work during these six months: the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, the new cycle of the Lisbon Strategy and also our climate and energy package."
"Specifically on this point, I was very encouraged by the support that many of you gave to our work on this matter."
"It is very important that we now deliver on our commitments."
"The Heads of State and Government agreed on ambitious targets - a 20% reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases and 20% for renewables."
"We cannot have the targets and then not deliver on the means of achieving those targets."
"It is a question of coherence and of credibility, and I was very encouraged by the support given to this during today's debate."
"I would like just to answer one question that was brought to the debate by Mr Schulz, Mr Lambsdorff and Mr Brok regarding a specific problem that is now being discussed in Germany - the question of possible funding for relocation of a company in Europe."
"I can tell you that the operational programme on competitiveness for Romania has a specific clause banning the use of Structural Funds for the cofinancing of delocalisation."
"The European Commission has not received any project relevant to this issue, so the Commission can confirm that no European regional development funding is implicated in this relocation."
"Of course we consider that it would be unacceptable to use funding from European Union funds for relocation inside the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"At the same time it is true that the European Union, through the PHARE programme, has funded an industrial park in Romania where several companies are now investing."
"This is important and I will draw the attention of all my colleagues here, especially our German friends, to this debate and how important it is to have a responsibility in this debate."
"We have to make a distinction between delocalisation outside the European Union and relocation in Europe."
"If investment goes from Finland to Germany, it can also go from Germany to Romania."
"Let us be honest about it."
"We have to make clear that this is not delocalisation outside the European Union."
"As you remember, the Commission and I have proposed a Globalisation Adjustment Fund that is already working precisely for cases where some jobs could be affected by delocalisations outside the European Union."
"It is very important that European leaders at all levels in the European Union - in the Commission, in the European Parliament, but also at national level - also have the courage to explain the benefits of enlargement."
"(Applause)"
"Germany is the country that is now exporting more to the new Member States."
"The enlargement of the European Union is creating jobs in Germany too."
"German companies are also investing a lot in the new Member States."
"So it very important from a European perspective that we all explain that enlargement of the European Union is not only good for the new Members but it is also an opportunity for the European Union as a whole."
"(Applause)"
"At the same time, I agree that we have to check that no Structural Funds money is used to finance a specific delocalisation of a company."
"That would be unfair competition."
"But I call on all those who are pro-European to stand up and defend this united enlarged Europe, and also to exploit the benefits that we all, in all the new Member States, are getting from this more dynamic Europe that we can build today."
"(Applause)"
"Many thanks, President of the Commission, for this statement."
"We wish the Slovenian Presidency every success."
"We will now go together to the press conference."
"Voting will then take place here."
"Thank you for the very intensive and good debate."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FR) Congratulations, Prime Minister Janša, for your speech to our European Parliament."
"You are the first leader of one of the nations freed from the yoke of communism that joined the European Union in 2004 to be President of the European Council."
"It is a challenge for you, for your people and for your government."
"There are no large and small countries: there are good and bad ones."
"Your economic results, your recent acceptance into the euro area and the prosperity of your people make you an example that should inspire many countries teaching lessons to others."
"You are the final part of the 'troika' that began with Germany and continued with Portugal, and you will pave the way for the success of the Presidencies in the next 'troika': France, the Czech Republic and Sweden."
"As I write these lines, I am thinking of Kosovo, your brothers in the Western Balkans, and their future in Europe."
"in writing. - (IT) Thank you, Mr President."
"The Slovenian Presidency commences at a time when, in Europe, a sense of moderate optimism regarding the EU's future is again beginning to be felt."
"After a few years of confusion and uncertainty, the time has really come to make the EU 27 project take wing."
"Once again, I would like to ask the Presidency-in-Office to reflect on one particular issue, and that is the two meeting places of the European Parliament."
"Now, when we are constantly asking the citizens of our various countries to make sacrifices, we will give a really strong signal if we decide to focus all our work in Brussels."
"The cost, in terms of financial resources and organisational inconvenience, incurred by Europe due to this monthly change of location is becoming truly unacceptable in the eyes of citizens, who cannot understand the reasons for such an absurd situation."
"The seat in Strasbourg, which is of course a magnificent city, could be used for other prestigious purposes within the EU's activities."
"Let us give a good example and, on that theme, let us turn words into action."
"in writing. - (PT) With the Slovenian Presidency of the Council comes the opening of the third act of the farce orchestrated by the forces promoting federalist, neoliberal and militarist integration in Europe, in which the EU - with Germany at the helm - imposes a treaty that was previously rejected, avoiding the holding of national referendums."
"They say that there is no need to hold referendums:"
"Because there is a 'broad consensus' in every country on what the Treaty proposes, especially in the national parliaments."
"However, one of the main lessons of the referendums in France and the Netherlands was surely that they revealed a profound contradiction between the will of the people and the 'parliamentary majorities'."
"Because ratification by the parliaments is as legitimate and democratic as ratification by referendum."
"How then should we understand the claim that holding a referendum in Portugal would aggravate the risks of the Treaty not entering into force?"
"What they fear is a referendum result that differs from what they want, and so do not hold any."
"Because the Treaty proposal is different from the one that was rejected previously and involves 'substantial change'. Yet they do not say what."
"However, do the promoters themselves not claim that the substance is the same?"
"Read the statements by Giscard d'Estaing."
"They are motivated by fear..."
"in writing. - (HU) Before I start, I would like to welcome the ambitious programme of the Slovenian Presidency, which is treating the important cohesion of the Western Balkans as a prominent question for the whole EU."
"According to the Commission's annual report for 2006, the accession of 2004 was a great result for the old and new Member States, but the smooth management of the process was the key factor in its success."
"The EU currently has to confront new challenges that require greater efforts."
"Maximum support from the Slovenian Presidency in fulfilling all the priorities of its programme is essential for handling these matters appropriately, including the creation of the preconditions for Croatian and Turkish accession."
"The fundamental interest of the EU is supporting the processes of reform in the Western Balkans, and in sorting out the Kosovo situation within the framework of the European Perspective in a way that is acceptable to everyone."
"Enlargement is a strategic and security policy interest for the EU, and requires an effective development policy and cooperation in partnership."
"The emphasis must also continue to be placed on dealing with programmes for the Western Balkans that serve to reduce differences in the state of development and strengthen social, economic and regional cohesion."
"However, stimulating investment in human resources and supporting the development of a knowledge-based, creative society are essential for ensuring balance between increasing competitiveness and cohesion, and encouraging the development of the Western Balkans."
"In accordance with the principle of European solidarity, efforts must be made to end poverty and guarantee 'direct aid' for the countries of the Western Balkans too."
"It is our joint responsibility to support the programme of the Slovenian Presidency so as to achieve the main objectives of the Union."
"All the countries that have joined the European Union since 2004 are proud of the fact that one of them - Slovenia - is taking on the Presidency."
"We welcome the new Presidency's announcements and the first steps it has taken."
"The priorities for the first half of 2008 are to a large extent evidence that the work of Slovenia's predecessors is being continued, primarily in the sphere of revival of the Lisbon Agenda, ratification of the new Treaty and action to prevent global warming."
"Continuity of work is a desirable feature in the European Union, bearing in mind the half-yearly cycle of the Presidency."
"Independently of its declared priorities, Slovenia, because of its geography and history, is seen as a country with links to the Balkans."
"This brings with it both opportunities to enlarge the Union further and, first and foremost, serious problems regarding the question of Kosovo's independence."
"An understanding of this problem area is a clear ace that the new Presidency holds."
"We also hope that a country which has gone through the labour of transformation and adaptation to EU standards will appreciate the problems new Member States face in terms of unreasonable obligations regarding renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions."
"A balance needs to be found between care in protecting the natural environment and the need to keep the European economy competitive in global terms."
"I wish you success, and thank you for your attention."
"in writing. - (SK) The start of 2008, of 'Together in Diversity: the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue', is a significant period for the EU, all the more so due to the fact that the EU Presidency in the first half of the year will for the first time be held by a new Member State, Slovenia."
"Four priority areas that emphasise the implementation of the new Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment, energy, climate change and relations with the Western Balkans can contribute towards synergy in Europe."
"Slovenia has an opportunity to become the architect of EU world leadership in the fight against global warming."
"The acceptance of the euro is currently a hot topic in Slovakia."
"Slovakia's acceptance into the euro zone will be decided during the Slovenian Presidency of the European Union."
"Slovenia is an example to Slovakia: it was the first of the EU-10 countries and the thirteenth of all EU Member States to introduce the euro, which it did in 2007."
"Slovakia can learn from many of Slovenia's experiences and can use them in its own preparation for the introduction of the euro."
"I expect that Slovenia will do everything possible to make sure that the decision on whether to introduce the euro in Slovakia by the planned deadline of 1 January 2009 has a positive outcome."
"I hope that by its actions the Slovenian Presidency can convince 500 million European citizens that even a small country with 2 million people is capable of successful leadership of the EU during its six-month presidency."
"I believe that Slovenia will indeed succeed."
"in writing. - (FR) I would like to give my warmest wishes for success to the Slovenian Presidency, which represents a form of consecration of the reunification of a Europe divided by the Cold War."
"Slovenia, which has cooperated with Germany and Portugal to prepare an 18-month programme, ends a cycle of presidencies marked by a successful relaunch of the institutions and the heavy responsibility of seeing through the process of ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It is a major challenge to which we must all contribute, in each of our respective Member States, to ensure that the forthcoming French Presidency can put this new common foundation definitively in place before the European elections in 2009."
"The Slovenian Presidency must also continue and complete the Lisbon Strategy to meet the challenges Europe has to face on energy and climate change, growth and employment."
"I sincerely hope that the Slovenian Presidency will manage to guarantee peace and stability in the Western Balkans and produce a unified EU approach to the issue of the final status of Kosovo so that 2008, the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, can truly be a chance for all Europeans to reaffirm their values of tolerance and mutual understanding."
"in writing. - (HU) It is of historical significance that a new Member State that joined the Union in 2004 is leading it in the first half of 2008."
"This is a major step forward in the recently acceded countries taking the places they deserve at the Union table."
"There is a huge amount at stake for the first Presidency from one of the new Member States, and Slovenia is leading the Union at a key time."
"The most important duties of the Slovenian Presidency are helping with the ratification process for the Lisbon Treaty, dynamically setting in motion the new three-year cycle for the Lisbon Strategy and continuing to develop the integrated energy and climate protection policy."
"The Slovenian Presidency is handling the integration of the Western Balkans, especially the question of Kosovo's future status, as a priority."
"Slovenia's sensitivity and knowledge of the region may make the complicated organisation process a little easier and promote preservation of the unity achieved by the European Council of December 2007 with regard to the missions to be sent to Kosovo."
"In March, during the Slovenian Presidency, the European Commission will propose legislation for a health check on the Common Agricultural Policy, which will be the overture to comprehensive conceptual and funding reforms for the CAP."
"The Presidency will also emphasise programmes for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue in 2008."
"We are cheering on our Slovenian friends, so that they have a successful Presidency."
"I am sure that the Slovenian policies and diplomacy will successfully solve the difficult tasks, and that, as a new Member State, we can be proud of our neighbour."
"Agenda"
"We have an announcement before we start with regard to this afternoon's debates."
"I should like to propose bringing forward the debate on the report by Díaz de Mera García Consuegra on EUROPOL and taking it as the second item before the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Pakistan."
"The order of business this afternoon would, therefore, be as follows: from 15.00 to 18.00: first of all, the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Kenya, then the report by Díaz de Mera García Consuegra on EUROPOL, then the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Pakistan; then at 18.00, as normal, we would go on to Question Time with the Council."
"Are there any comments?"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, for once we can agree, but I should like the Commission to note that it is Parliament that sets the agenda and only in exceptional circumstances can we respond to the wishes of individual Commissioners."
"We can agree today, however, by way of exception."
"Thank you for that point, Mr Swoboda; it clearly is an exception."
"But I thank the House for its agreement."
"(Parliament agreed to the request)"
"1. ("
"2. ("
"- Before the vote:"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to take the opportunity to clarify a point which was raised in yesterday's debate on the proposal for a Consumer Credit Directive."
"This point concerned the new version of Article 8 concerning the obligation to assess the credit-worthiness of consumers."
"Both amendments 46 and 45 foresee that Member States whose legislation requires creditors to assess the creditworthiness of consumers on the basis of consultation of the relevant database may retain this requirement."
"As I understand it, this also means that the sanctions foreseen in this national legislation for a failure of the creditor to fulfil these requirements could also be retained."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, as we have now been debating this guideline in the institutions for six years, I would therefore like to make a few comments."
"Firstly, I would say that this should not be taken as a criticism, but this lengthy period shows how European legislators have dealt very earnestly with this complicated subject and how close consumer protection lies to our hearts in Europe."
"I am confident that the legislative procedure will be finalised with today's vote, which is also my intention, despite all the differences on the subject at various points."
"I want to expressly put on record that in my view all the joint amendments now available without exception improve the Council's text, the joint position."
"They certainly also hark back for the most part to my own proposals."
"To clarify matters, I wish to say that we have wanted to reach an agreement, and in order to come to an agreement, on Article 16(2) as well, which until recently had actually been disputed merely on account of the wording, we have decided to approve the proposal by the Socialists and Liberals in order to resolve this issue amicably, just as we have also withdrawn a few other amendments for the sake of harmony."
"I also wish to thank the Commission, the Council and Members expressly (we have had intensive, even heated discussions) for the cooperative and enjoyable teamwork."
"As regards the remaining proposals, I would emphasise the statement that in my view they are merely an additional improvement to the joint position and would in no way compromise consumer protection and the benefit this would have from the directive, because it is also a high priority for us."
"I wish to conclude by expressing the hope that the positive expectations arising from the directive will also be met."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, yesterday the IND/DEM Group asked for all the votes to be roll-call votes."
"I note in today's votes that, again, all the votes are roll-call votes."
"Yesterday the President said that he was going to examine whether it was in fact possible for the IND/DEM Group to ask for roll-call votes."
"Am I to understand that it is possible, and that from now on all our votes will be roll-call votes?"
"Mr Matsakis, it will be discussed at the Conference of Presidents tomorrow but what I would say is that this is an important vote, so it is probably in all our interests that it is by roll-call vote."
"Mr Bonde has asked for the floor."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, I had asked for the floor before."
"Our voting yesterday went very well."
"It was quicker than normal - smooth, calm and there was not a single request for the time-consuming and irritating check."
"Therefore my group proposes we should continue with electronic voting."
"Some six months ago I was promised an exercise where the numbers of the reports and the numbers of the amendments would be shown alongside our voting."
"The new, much bigger screens can show the full voting list and save us much more time because we can vote immediately when we see the numbers in different colours on the screen."
"We will not need to wait for the interpretation."
"We will avoid the situation where those waiting for interpretation through a relay are voting on one issue while those who vote without relay are voting on the next item."
"We would save a lot of time."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mr Bonde, we have noted that."
"Work is ongoing on that project, but now I think the House would like to move on with this morning's vote."
"3. ("
"- Before the vote:"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to raise a point of order: without wishing to interfere with the procedure, I would like to know if there is a rule by which it is compulsory each time to state, as well as the result, the number of voters, the number of abstentions and so on, or whether this is your own choice."
"If you do not wish me to tell you I will not, but it is, clearly, good to be certain."
"- After the vote on paragraph 60:"
"Madam President, could you at least put the results on the screens in front of us if you are not going to call them out?"
"You just have to raise your eyes if you wish to see the result."
"- After the vote:"
"Madam President, I am advised by the services that each additional roll-call vote costs EUR 400, which makes the cost of yesterday's escapade in excess of EUR 25 000."
"So, I would ask those who are calling for roll-call votes all the time whether they think that is a good use of taxpayers' money."
"Madam President, if the cost of every roll-call vote is really EUR 400, I suggest that this Chamber is running itself with all the efficiency that it also applies to the common agricultural policy, to structural aid, to international development and to the rest of the European Union budget."
"Surely we can do it more cheaply than that!"
"Madam President, here is a practical suggestion."
"One of the expenses is that we translate votes, but these are only numbers, so we need only one edition of the votes."
"We do not need to put them into every language because we are dealing with numbers, and the names are the same in every language."
"So we can cut expense there."
"I think of all the bits of paper we produce in this Parliament."
"The most important thing for the citizen is to know how we vote."
"(Applause)"
"4. ("
"- After the vote:"
"President of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - Madam President, I wanted to intervene after the vote on the Lechner report."
"I did not want to interrupt the voting, but I merely wanted to thank the PPE-DE Group for supporting the common position so that we now have a very strong majority, which will be a very good signal to both consumers and businesses that we intend to open up the market and protect consumers."
"Madam President, I know that you have taken a very active role in this dossier and I think it is a credit to all the parties that we just got a tremendous majority in the end after many doubts and reservations."
"Voting time"
"The next item is the vote."
"(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"Madam President, as someone who has followed, through the Committee on Budgetary Control, a number of the Court of Auditors' reports concerning misappropriations and fraudulent spending of monies from the agriculture budget, I must say how pleased I am to see this Parliament welcoming new technology in many different ways, especially in this field of agriculture."
"I hope that in future years this information - as one of the amendments in this report suggested - can be spread via the internet to all those people across the European Union who would like to see it, especially to the various national audit authorities in each Member State so they can see, for example, if in Greece they are claiming more acreage for olive-producing land than they actually have."
"I am also standing up because I want to talk about the Constitutional Treaty."
"I want to make sure that this House gets a say and that people get a referendum in the future, and that is why I am giving explanations of votes on all reports."
"Madam President, it may not be obvious why, as a representative of London, I am giving an explanation of vote on a matter concerning farming and the common agricultural policy."
"But we have to recognise that the common agricultural policy also affects consumers right across the EU in the form of higher prices."
"Therefore it is incumbent on all of us to make sure that we are monitoring how taxpayers' money is spent in a number of areas, including the common agricultural policy."
"I understand that, in response to the common agricultural policy management needs, there is considerable need for information on land use, and that is why I think we all welcome the use of better technology."
"I hope that many of my constituents will benefit in terms of providing that technology."
"I also have to agree with my colleague that one of the reasons I am giving an explanation of vote is because the people of Europe and the people of Britain should be given a say on the Constitutional Treaty in the form of a referendum."
"I would like to remind colleagues that we are taking explanations of vote on the reports concerned."
"If anybody tries to speak about anything else, I am afraid I will stop your speech, in accordance with the Rules."
"Madam President, I will with pleasure speak on the report itself."
"The Graefe zu Baringdorf report, explaining as it does the new methods to address fraud and agrarian policy under the common agricultural policy (CAP), is dealing with one of the most inefficient, expensive, wasteful, bureaucratic and amoral systems of farm support known to man, and no amount of agro-meteorological gimmickry can rescue it."
"Extrapolate from the experience of the CAP; infer from it."
"Before handing new powers to any organisation, we should first look at how it exercises the powers it already controls."
"Agriculture has been, since 1960, the European Union's chief competence."
"Look at the mess it has made - the ecological destruction, the destruction of surpluses, the poverty inflicted on Africa."
"Is this the institution that we now want to put in charge of foreign policy, of criminal justice, of defence, and if it is, should we not consult the people in the referendums that we were promised?"
"The Elder Cato is supposed to have ended every speech, whatever its subject, with the demand that Carthage be destroyed."
"I shall end mine with the demand that the Lisbon Treaty be put to the people: Pactio Olisipio censenda est!"
"Madam President, I do not think any of us should be unduly concerned about new technology, but it is important that it is properly used and not abused."
"But there is much abuse, particularly in southern Europe in regard to the common agricultural policy, and I trust this technology may do something towards eliminating this."
"If it does, we could save much more than the EUR 400 that someone complained about when it comes to bringing transparency to voting."
"I note that this report talks about remote sensing."
"Well, I would also say this: if Europe could get a sense of democratic sensing, then it would sense across Europe a great resentment at the shutting out of citizens and the denying to them of the right to express their opinion on the most important matter, namely the matter of how they should be governed."
"Madam President, the common agricultural policy is a leftover from the 20th century."
"We are seeing more and more demand for agricultural products driven by demographics and biofuels."
"The idea that we as the European Union should spend a large part of our budget on subsidising agricultural production is, quite simply, out of date and, therefore, there is no reason why we need better technology to do the wrong thing."
"We should stop doing the wrong thing."
"I have to say that I voted in favour of this measure as a loyal Conservative following the whip, but I did so with great reluctance."
"In addition, I have to question the right of this House - the democratic legitimacy of this House - to adopt this measure and any other measure given that we reject the verdict of the people on the Lisbon Treaty."
"Madam President, I sense that this measure of remote sensing would actually be very efficient with regard to cutting out the bureaucracy that some of my farmers in the South East of England have to suffer at present with regard to tagging."
"If this mechanism is to work properly, I recognise that it would be more efficient in the operation of the extremely inefficient bureaucratic system which we recognise as the CAP."
"So in that regard, as a loyal Conservative, I followed the whip and supported this measure."
"However, I recognise that an overhaul of the complete CAP system is long overdue and I call upon our colleagues in this Parliament who recognise the same thing to accelerate that process."
"I do, however, sense - and I feel - that if we can remote sense cows, why do we not remote sense the people's views about the referendum?"
"Madam President, I am very happy to rise to explain my vote on the Graefe zu Baringdorf report, where I voted against it."
"I did so because any kind of remote-sensing apparatus is bound to lead to longer-distance surveillance."
"Where will that end?"
"We do not wish the people of Europe to be surveyed by some kind of remote sensor - cameras in the sky - because that is exactly what the Graefe zu Baringdorf report will lead to by extension."
"Is this, we have to ask ourselves, an excuse to give work for the Galileo project, the enormous expense of which, if not used there, would have paid for all the roll-call votes in this House for the next ten years?"
"If the EU wants to survey anything, let it survey the wishes of the people of Europe and hold a referendum on the new Constitution signed in Lisbon, without delay."
"Madam President, I know you actually share our views on this referendum because I know you personally want one yourself, because it would give legitimacy to this place."
"But leaving that political difference aside, I - happily - am not a Conservative, therefore I do not have to vote blindly for complete nonsense."
"I can vote with common sense, and I voted against the Baringdorf report because I find the whole idea of the spy in the sky and satellites deeply distasteful and extremely frightening."
"I think it can only lead to long-term abuse."
"It is bound to happen - and I know our lady friend down here, who is all motherhood and apple pie, thinks it is absolutely wonderful - but of course we have got to look at the next generation."
"I am afraid I have a deep distrust of politicians."
"If they can abuse a power, they always do, and I see this as being absolutely no different, so I voted against."
"Madam President, I should like to explain why I voted against the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf."
"The CAP has done nothing but ruin our farming industry in the UK for well over 30 years; we do not want interference from the EU; this will extend their interference yet again."
"So the reason for voting against it is that we would like to get the powers of running our own agriculture back to Britain."
"However, there is very little chance of that while we ignore the votes of the people in France and Holland in the referendum that we should be given on the Constitution."
"- (CS) I would like to stress that I voted for the report on consumer credit, because I think that the report is a step in the right direction."
"I am pleased that we have managed to tame the regulatory enthusiasm of the Commission and the Council for more detailed legislation, which, in my opinion, is not desirable."
"There are differences between the Member States as result of their diverse law traditions and cultures of financing and an attempt to erase these differences by force will not, in my opinion, lead to success."
"Therefore, it is good that the European Parliament has focused on the basic elements: principles of harmonisation of consumer credit (here I would like to stress the right to cancel an agreement and the option of early repayment without a financial penalty for the consumer)."
"I consider a two-week deadline for withdrawal from an agreement by either of the parties to be necessary for the legal certainty of all the parties involved."
"At the same time it is important to ensure that in the case of a linked credit agreement this deadline may be reduced to three days at the request of the consumer."
"It will enable consumers to take earlier possession of the product purchased."
"I think that a provision that guarantees that early repayment of credit cannot harm consumers is more than sufficient."
"The Member States will be obliged to integrate this provision into their national legislation and consumer interests will thus be protected."
"(SK) Madam President, I have voted for the Council common position, which was amended by the Kurt Lechner report."
"After more than six years of legislative work, the directive on consumer credit agreements is a significant step forward in the protection of contractual freedom and encourages responsible decision-making by consumers."
"It is necessary to bear in mind that a large number of regulations does not automatically mean greater consumer protection."
"A deluge of information can cause greater confusion precisely in the case of an inexperienced consumer and the objective of simplicity and transparency is missed."
"In addition, it entails higher costs, which are in the end passed on to the consumer."
"In spite of continuing interest in buying on credit and in spite of the use of consumer credit products, very few consumers are aware of the risks connected with consumer credit, for example that in the event of illness or loss of job they might not be able to pay."
"I believe that this directive will help consumers to make the correct decisions on the basis of a quick and simple process of being able to compare more offers from domestic, as well as foreign, providers."
"Madam President, on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection where this report has been gestating for a long period of time in both readings, it is well known that I have had some severe criticism of it from its early stages where it was confusing new products that are available in one market - such as the UK market, such as mortgages where you can offset your credit balance with the same bank against your mortgage - which under initial proposals would have been banned in this report, to where we have now, after six years, new concerns - even though we have been talking about this report for six years - about the early repayment of credit costs."
"This is an amazingly important piece of legislation."
"It will affect huge numbers of people including anyone that owns a home in my constituency."
"I was talking about it in a Conservative meeting in the village of Harpole at the house of a man called Michael Orton-Jones who raised it with me personally, about the consumer credit directive and the money-laundering directives that are passed in this House."
"We have got to be much more careful in the way that we deal with this sort of very important legislation."
"Madam President, I represent London, the greatest city in the world, which happens to be home to Europe's two largest financial districts: firstly, the City of London, which, as we all know, is the pre-eminent financial force in the world, and, secondly, the Docklands - Canary Wharf - which used to trade in all manner of goods all over the world, and now it trades in financial services all over the world."
"I think it was that great group of Swedish philosophers who said: 'Money, money, money, I work all day, I work all night to pay the bills I have to pay, ain't it sad."
"But in my dreams I have a plan."
"I'll get myself a wealthy man.'"
"In my case that is not going to be true, because I do not happen to subscribe to that particular taste."
"But what I will say is that it is important for consumers right across Europe that we continue to look at ways to make it easier to have access to consumer credit, not only for my constituents in London but also for the financial services industry."
"Mr Kamall, I am trying to take this very seriously, but I hope it is not going to degenerate into the radio programme Just a Minute that we know so well in the UK."
"(Laughter)"
"Madam President, one minute without repetition, deviation or - what was the other one?"
"Hesitation! Quite so."
"Let us start, then, from first principles."
"Why does the European Union need to have a policy on the harmonisation of consumer credit laws?"
"There seems to me to be a contextual misunderstanding behind this report."
"Free trade and open markets do not require common laws on every aspect of commercial activity."
"In fact, if anything, the opposite is true."
"Free markets depend upon diversity, variety, pluralism and, although a degree of light regulation at national level may sometimes be in order, that does not equate to euro-harmonisation of every aspect of market activity."
"This is important because it seems to me that the same conceptual error lies behind the extension of EU jurisdiction in the various fields proposed in the Lisbon Treaty."
"As in the field of consumer protection, so in the fields of justice and home affairs, foreign affairs, defence and all the rest."
"If these areas are to be transferred largely or wholly to Brussels, we ought at least to have the courtesy to consult our constituents first."
"The Treaty of Lisbon should be put to the people: Pactio Olisipio censenda est!"
"Madam President, harmonisation, as we all know, has been a primary tool of the EU since its inception."
"It has reached into every facet of our lives and it is quite clear that it is a strategy - a strategy, of course, to diminish the relevance and the import of national decisions and the ability to take national decisions and thereby diminish national institutions."
"So it has been the modus operandi of intensifying European integration and it is something therefore which I come to with quite a hostile attitude."
"Because fundamentally I believe in the right of Member States to govern within their boundaries that which affects their citizens."
"There is one aspect of harmonisation we could help on."
"We could harmonise giving to the citizens of Europe the right to have their say on the Lisbon Treaty."
"Madam President, I think it is relevant when making an explanation of vote actually to say how we voted."
"In my case I voted in favour of this measure, again as a loyal Conservative, again following the whip and again, had I been left to make my own decision, I would have voted against it, for the reasons very clearly set out by some of my colleagues, particularly Mr Hannon's reference to free markets requiring diversity."
"Madam President, I can ask the honourable Member if he can give way to me."
"I just wondered if he could maybe re-assess his comments because, this being a second reading report, there was a ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Sorry, but we will have the explanation of vote from Mr Helmer."
"Each speaker has one minute in which to give an explanation of vote."
"Mr Helmer, please continue."
"Madam President, I agree that credit should be a matter for national governments to decide, subject to local custom and practice."
"The amount of credit taken across borders is not sufficient to justify harmonisation, but may I suggest that the European Union itself is running out of credit with citizens because it refuses to take the necessary action, through referendums, to legitimise itself?"
"Madam President, this reminds me of my days in the House of Commons."
"If this report in the slightest way could have helped Mr Brown and this inept Labour Government back home not to have had the Northern Rock crisis, if this report had been in any way useful in teaching this Labour Government back home how to run an economy, well, I might have said this report is a good one."
"But, being a loyal Conservative I had to support it; I followed the whip."
"But if we talk about credit, credit means trust, and if the European Union cannot trust its citizens and the citizens of Europe cannot trust the European institutions, is that why we are not going for a referendum?"
"Because we do not trust our citizens to decide in the right way?"
"Madam President, I voted in this report in order to help Member States and I therefore pick out these bits: Amendment 46, split vote - Member States' own laws may not be waived."
"I voted for that and I am glad to see that I was supported."
"I voted for Amendment 9, part 1 - extending areas in which an obligation shall not apply."
"I am sorry to see that failed."
"I voted for Amendment 29, where it states that compensation must be according to national law."
"I am sorry to see that failed as well."
"I voted, therefore, in order to help Member State governments, but that should not be read to mean that I want a Member State government to interfere in the affairs of finance houses and banks."
"As my colleague Mr Deva pointed out, they are signally ill-equipped to do so."
"In the case of Northern Rock, they have spent half the Treasury money on trying to rescue it, and who knows if that is at an end."
"What we know is at an end are the referendums on the Lisbon Treaty, and that should not be so."
"Madam President, I have a confession to make."
"I have absolutely no qualifications whatsoever for this job and yet I find myself sitting here helping to make legislation that affects around 400 million people."
"When I look around the full Chamber, I fear that very many of the Members share my lack of qualifications, looking at the level of debate we seem to get here."
"The people, the citizens of the Member States, have an enormous amount of intelligence collectively, yet we deny them the right to make their own decisions."
"In my view, this is in an area that politicians should keep well out of and give the people their own decisions; in particular, please let them have a referendum on the EU Constitution."
"- (MT) I wish to briefly explain the manner in which I voted in order to attract the attention of the Maltese authorities."
"I would like to draw attention to two cases in particular."
"Firstly, the case of the Gozitan boy, Mr Attard's son, which attracted media attention in the last two years because of the way in which his father suffered prejudice by being denied his paternal rights as a father figure and bringing the child to live in his country, Gozo."
"Secondly, the recent criminal case of a 13-year-old girl, in which the authorities did not know where to send her; she was sent first to prison, and then to a mental institution."
"This is a grave failure."
"Thank you."
"- (DE) Madam President, I speak on behalf of the ÖVP-Europa-Club [Austrian People's Party European Club]."
"We have blackballed all articles that include the right to sexual and reproductive health, because the interpretation of this text can also, of course, be used to terminate pregnancies at any point in time and we are against this."
"We voted in favour of Article 127 on the headscarf ban, because young people should not be encouraged to wear political symbols and because we want to guarantee that freedom to vote and freedom of choice continue to be safeguarded for young people."
"We also voted in favour of Article 116, but this does not mean that mandatory legal consequences would be derived from it."
"Madam President, I came to this report actually with some trepidation, because I am always aware that many of these reports call for an extension of powers in this place that we do not actually have already."
"In my constituency I represent a town called Rothley in Leicestershire, which is where the McCanns live."
"They have been very active in calling upon this Parliament to be more active in holding registers of missing children and various other matters."
"I also represent in the town of Northampton a new charity called 'KidsAid' founded by a gentleman called David Mackintosh, who again had strong opinions that most of this report was actually very, very good."
"However, as is always the case in this House, political correctness took over, and you look at amendments 162, 163 and 164 and you see how this place tries to extend its powers."
"There is a motto which is used around this place: if you do not succeed, redefine success."
"It is what you have done on the Lisbon Treaty, and I very much hope that the people in my constituency get to have a say on that."
"Madam President, I rise to offer an explanation of vote on the Angelilli report 'Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child'."
"I note in the explanatory statement that the rapporteur says she 'wishes to point out that the aim of this report is not to draw up a list of problems to be resolved or rights to be taken into account as a matter of priority'."
"I represent a constituency, London, the greatest city in the world, capital of the greatest country in the world, and there are a number of children in my constituency."
"In fact, I am the father of two children and, as the great philosopher once said, I believe that children are our future."
"Therefore, it is important that we do take account of the rights of children."
"But I really have to question whether this should be done at EU level."
"Let us look, for example, at whether we want young adolescents to be given information and education on that dirty word 'sexual and reproductive rights'."
"I think we should be very careful in looking for local solutions - and give the people of Britain a say on a referendum on the Constitution."
"Madam President, Disraeli once replied to a delegation with the phrase 'to the liberalism that they profess, I prefer the liberties we enjoy, to the rights of man, the rights of Englishmen'."
"Our national tradition of rights is not merely different from the European conception of universal entitlements; it is incompatible."
"We point to specific liberties, ones at specific moments guaranteed in specific charters, whether Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights or in simple statute acts; we do not put our faith in universalist human rights codes interpreted by judges for whom we cannot vote."
"I have to say, our tradition has had more success than that pursued by some of the continental states which have taken the universalist path."
"We have not fallen, as other countries have, either to revolution or to dictatorship."
"We believe that all rights are residual in the individual."
"As Aldous Huxley once put it, 'liberties are not given, they are taken'."
"That is why I fundamentally oppose the incorporation of the EU Charter in the Lisbon Treaty without a referendum."
"The people must be consulted: Pactio Olisipio censenda est!"
"Madam President, there are serious issues here and there are serious moral issues."
"Certainly my vote was motivated in great measure by consideration of some of those."
"I find portions of this report offensive."
"I find it offensive to take the position that one must impose upon children what someone perceives to be, in their view, the reproductive rights for adolescents that we find in recital L and in paragraphs 162, 163 and 164 etc."
"It does seem to me wrong and inappropriate to have foisted upon one society ideological and morally prejudicial values which might be at variance with the established ethical outlook of a particular region."
"It is that which I fundamentally object to and, as Mr Hannan has said, it is that which the Charter will bring to us more and more."
"That is why I want my citizens to be able to agree or disagree."
"Madam President, I voted against this measure."
"For the first time we come to an item where the Conservative whip was a free vote and I took advantage of that freedom."
"I agree very much with what my colleagues have already said."
"This measure contains much that I agree with: it contains a great deal of motherhood and apple pie, and we all agree with motherhood and apple pie."
"But, on the other hand, it proposes that we provide sex education for children in order to reduce teenage pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases."
"It is my experience that if you tell children about something and teach them how to do it, the first thing is that they want to go out and do it, and we should not be surprised if they do!"
"We hear far too much about adolescent reproductive rights and not about reproductive responsibilities."
"We should be more responsible in our approach to children, and it should be exercised by parents and locally."
"In conclusion, I believe that, before we go ahead with this, we should have a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty."
"Madam President, I am very disappointed by this report and I have to say, taking advantage of the free vote, I voted against much of the report."
"This report is not about the rights of children."
"It is about the right of children to have sex and the right of children to have abortions, which I find quite difficult to accept."
"But what about the rights of children and their parents to decide the future of Europe, and the future of the Lisbon Treaty, and the future of where we are going?"
"After all, all these institutions are not being built for us - they are being built for our children."
"Are we going to ask what they and their parents feel and want to say about how Europe is going to develop?"
"No."
"We shall decide, without any rights being conferred on them to tell themselves or us what their own destiny should be."
"This is all wrong."
"(Applause)"
"(NL) Madam President, just for the record, I voted against Mrs Angelilli's report."
"This is not, of course, because I oppose children's rights - far from it."
"Indeed, I welcome the fact that the report breaks a couple of this House's taboos, such as the taboo of structural violence against girls in the Muslim community."
"The report even states - rightly, in my view - that the obligation for girls in the Muslim community to wear headscarves is detrimental to the development of their personalities."
"Whilst I agree with all of this, I voted against this report, as it is a further example of enormous European interference."
"I believe that all these matters can be dealt with better at national level and that Europe has precious little to do with it."
"I would like to give a single example."
"This report argues very strongly against prison sentences for minors, whereas in my country there is a broad popular consensus in favour of imprisoning even those serious criminals who are underage to encourage them to mend their ways."
"(SK) Madam President, we need to keep renewing our knowledge throughout our working life, not only during our years at school."
"Education is important for personal growth and better employment opportunities."
"As companies assess the need for new qualifications and the requirements of the labour market, adult education will adapt to these requirements, thus helping to overcome the discrepancies in the labour market."
"All this is taken into account in the Commission's proposal for an adult education action plan, and therefore I have voted in favour of it."
"I agree that the EU Member States should help adult education by adopting active measures, motivating citizens to educate themselves and employers to provide suitable conditions for education."
"There should be economic stimulus in the form of grants, tax allowances, contributions or cofinancing."
"For this purpose a more active use of the Structural Funds, and the European Social Fund in particular, is necessary too."
"I feel that it is exceptionally important for older people to get involved in lifelong learning and thus find a place in the labour market."
"Madam President, I voted in favour of the Pack report, since one of the purposes of lifelong learning is to increase the flexibility of the labour market."
"For people over 50, which also concerns me, such a policy creates a wider range of opportunities to react to changes in the labour market and adapt to the situation without major repercussions."
"The report emphasises the positive effect of lifelong learning on social inclusion and employability, which in any case should not be disregarded in an ageing society, for example in my home country, Estonia."
"- (DE) Madam President, Mrs Pack's report on 'Adult Education: It is never to late to learn' is in my opinion one of the most important programmes of action in the European Union: the motivation to take part in adult education programmes, the learning of foreign languages, the motivation to complete tertiary education and with it the chance of having better job opportunities and therefore a better income, as well as the opportunity for better integration of immigrants."
"It is particularly important for women, however, that the relevant framework programmes for child care are available here."
"In particular we must also pay great attention to the possibility of exchanging knowledge between the generations."
"For this reason the ÖVP-Europa-Club was happy to approve this report."
"- (CS) (Beginning of the speech not audible) ... the introduction to this report on adult education clearly emphasises the attention paid to life-long learning in all the EU institutions."
"However, the accumulation of documentation, kind words, appeals and supporting votes, including my own, are not enough."
"Let us encourage the educational institutions to get really conceptually involved in life-long learning."
"This process must not be seen as some sort of appendix to traditional education, but should become a full part of the education system."
"That requires substantial changes."
"This process could, therefore, represent a significant financial burden for each country, which could be a limiting factor in the development of education."
"When considering where to direct funds when adjusting the funding for individual EU policies, this sphere - and in particular the universities as the natural centres of learning - should not be forgotten."
"Madam President, this report is entitled 'Adult education: it is never too late to learn'."
"I wish the European Commission and those who want the Lisbon Treaty to go through would learn from that statement themselves."
"Adult education is one of the most important parts of the education system."
"Lifelong learning is something that I think most in this House will agree is a very good thing."
"We all had amazing teachers when we were at school and we all remember them."
"I had a brilliant mathematics teacher who taught me there were three kinds of people: those who can count, and those who cannot."
"I had a brilliant science teacher who taught me that radioactive cats had 18 half lives."
"But the most important thing is, I guess, a phrase that you will recognise, a phrase that the youth of today are using more and more. 'We don't need no education; we don't need no thought control'."
"What we are doing with the Lisbon Treaty is putting another 'brick in the wall' between the voters who put us here and the European elites who abuse them."
"Madam President, I should just like to acknowledge how patient you have been during these explanations of vote."
"Thank you very much for laughing at some of the jokes as well."
"You may be aware that I represent London, the greatest city in the world, capital of the greatest country in the world."
"In London there are a number of educational institutions."
"I myself went to school in London; I went to the London School of Economics to do my Master's course."
"However, what I would like to say in regard to this particular explanation of vote is that we should not underestimate the role of the further education sector in lifelong learning."
"In particular, there are some very excellent institutions: Bromley College, with its excellent head, Peter Jones - I would like to put that on record - and Westminster College."
"We all deserve a say on the referendum on the Constitution."
"I could return the flattery and say that up until now I thought we were doing quite well, but it is beginning to get a little repetitive."
"Madam President, may I add my thanks, alongside those to yourself, to your staff and to the interpreters for patience and good humour."
"Let me ask what any of this has to do with Brussels?"
"Under what Treaty article, indeed under what possible consideration of common sense is adult learning an EU competence?"
"Most of us accept that there is a case for multi-state initiatives to deal with plainly cross-border issues;"
"I can accept that argument - or at least an argument for a coordinated European strategy on, let us say, pollution or tariff reduction, perhaps elements of aviation and so on. Although, even here, European coordination does not equate to EU jurisdiction."
"But, adult learning?"
"Surely this, of all fields, is one that ought to be determined by national electorates through their own proper democratic mechanisms and procedures."
"Why do we always assume that the gentleman in Brussels knows better than the ordinary voter?"
"That same unlovely assumption lies behind the EU Constitution, now called the Lisbon Treaty, and that is why we should put that Treaty to the people: Pactio Olisipio censenda est!"
"Madam President, there is much of apple pie and motherhood about this report."
"But the fundamental importance of it is this: it signifies and typifies a belief that Brussels has a right to set agendas and to dictate to Member States how they should prioritise issues and expenditure that quite patently are within their own domain and should be exclusively so, because any region has the right to decide within its limited budget what its priorities are."
"If adult learning and increased expenditure is a priority, it should be so decided by that region or that nation, not by Brussels and not because of Brussels but because it is right for those circumstances in itself."
"We all learn - I have learnt much since I came here in 2004."
"What I have learnt most is the utter contempt in which the European elite hold their citizens and that is why they are denying the citizens the fundamental right of a vote."
"Madam President, I can tell you that, on this occasion, I voted against the measure, but I also voted in line with the Conservative whip, and this time I did so with a good will because I would have intended to vote against it anyway for the reasons that have been so clearly set out by my friends and colleagues, especially by Mr Hannan and Mr Allister."
"This is nothing to do with the European Union."
"I am in favour of education."
"I am in favour of adult education."
"I am absolutely against Brussels deciding how it should be done."
"Like Mr Hannan, I am unable to work out any basis in the Treaties on which it should be done."
"We have no legitimacy in terms of the Treaties for passing a measure like this."
"We equally have no legitimacy in the face of the rejection of the Constitution in France and in Holland for passing the same measure."
"We should now have referendums across the European Union on this question."
"Madam President, on a point of order, could I, being an adult and having had some education, ask Mr Hannon, who has, obviously, greater education than I, what his Latin expression means?"
"I am sure he will tell you after we have closed the sitting!"
"Madam President, this has been one of the liveliest debates in this European Parliament since its inception."
"Had we done this before we might have had the television cameras here and our constituents might find out what we are doing instead of these boring, turgid things we do day in, day out."
"Let me now turn to adult learning."
"It is never too late to learn, it says."
"This surely is a matter for subsidiarity: it is up to the nation states to decide what their priorities are."
"It is surely not for the Brussels Commission, surely not for the European Parliament to decide whether adult learning is imperative or not!"
"But it also says - does it not? - that it is never too late to learn, and surely one of the things we need to learn very fast is that we cannot divide the people of Europe from their decision-makers."
"We must enjoin them on how we want to run the European Union and, therefore, we must have a referendum."
"Madam President, I voted against this measure and I did so primarily because, you see, I am a schoolmaster."
"This measure without doubt leads directly, by linkage, to the European Qualifications Framework, which is a hijack."
"It is going to get people to study at their traditional universities, take their qualifications there, and then overstamp them with a new document with the EU logo, the EU crest, the EU motto, with no reference to the great university or college from which they got their learning."
"That is a distinct and very terrible denial of a seat of learning - and I make that remark for all the universities of Europe and not just those famous ones in Britain."
"To get back to the question of adult learning, I have a suggestion to make to you."
"Let us by all means encourage adult learning."
"Give every adult in the EU a copy of the Lisbon Treaty and then ask them to vote on it."
"Madam President, yes, I voted against this report."
"My explanation is that the UK Independence Party supports the return of the grants system for the UK, and I would like to point out that it is our membership of the EU that caused it to be abolished in England and Wales in the first place."
"However, it is up to Member States, and not the EU, to decide on tax incentives and cuts for employers who cooperate with adult learning."
"As with most things, we need less interference from the EU, not more."
"As I see that I am very well within my time, may I add that the coming ratification of the European Constitution, despite its rejection in two referendums, is undemocratic, cowardly and illegitimate."
"Time, but not your subject."
"(NL) Madam President, I voted against the Pack report; not, of course, because I oppose lifelong learning."
"On the contrary, no one in their right mind would doubt the great importance of adult education in our constantly changing world."
"I do think, however, that Europe, and first and foremost the European Commission, should not interfere too much in what is a competence of the Member States."
"This is not just a matter of common sense; it is also inherent in the principle of subsidiarity that is always being lauded here but in practice is increasingly proving to be a dead letter."
"- (DE) Madam President, I should like to make a verbal declaration regarding the very good Angelilli report on the EU strategy on the rights of the child."
"The radical treatment of the issues of child prostitution and sex tourism is particularly important."
"The victims of these criminal offences can also be found in our own backyards."
"In the border area between Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria, for example, prostitution involving women and increasingly children increased enormously after the opening of the borders."
"However, no attention was paid to this subject at EU level for a long time."
"Problems central to child prostitution, such as the networking of perpetrators through the Internet and the lack of cooperation regarding cross-border surveillance and law enforcement, can only be combated at European level."
"The report deals with these areas and incorporates them into a comprehensive strategy."
"Even though there is still a great deal to be done to combat child abuse, this is an encouraging sign."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the resolution on the report by my German fellow Member Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf and on the proposal for a regulation on the measures to be undertaken by the Commission in 2008-13 making use of the remote-sensing applications developed within the framework of the common agricultural policy."
"I support the proposal that the remote-sensing activities should be financed by a proper budget and not by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF)."
"Though my fellow members believe the focus should be more on improving the existing website of the EU's Joint Research Centre Agriculture Unit so that all relevant research data can be made freely available to the public, I am very much in favour of the creation of a spatial data infrastructure and a website as the European Commission's objectives propose."
"I support the proposals to create an inventory of all spatial data, remote-sensing and agro-meteorological projects, and to consolidate the existing spatial data infrastructure and websites."
"in writing. - (PT) The European Commission considers that, in order to provide a response to common agricultural policy management needs, there is considerable need for information on land use, land conditions and crop conditions."
"It has therefore presented remote sensing as a research method to gain easier access to the information contained in conventional agricultural statistics and forecasting systems."
"The proposal took account of a pilot project on remote-sensing techniques, under the auspices of Council Decision No 1445/2000/EC, initiated in the meantime."
"According to the Commission, this project enabled the agro-meteorological system for forecasting yields and monitoring land and crop conditions (MARS) to reach an advanced stage."
"Now the Commission is proposing the continued application of remote-sensing techniques in agriculture for the period 2008-2013, in the field of monitoring agricultural markets."
"The project will apply from 1 January 2008 for a six-year period."
"The remote-sensing applications would thus constitute a tool for the Commission to implement and monitor the common agriculture policy, although the information could be useful to the Member States."
"The question is how it will be used and who will be using it, hence our abstention."
"in writing. - (PT) While I am in broad agreement with the European Commission's proposal, I am voting in favour of the Graefe zu Baringdorf report since it makes some relevant points."
"I understand, for example, the rapporteur's concern over the impossibility of comparing data between different Member States owing to the different frequency of analyses."
"I still approve of the creation of an inventory and consolidation of spatial data infrastructure and the relevant websites, and the improvement of the Agriculture Unit's website to make the data public."
"in writing. - (SV) We vote against this report because, as usual, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament seeks to introduce amendments aimed at transferring more money from the EU budget to the agricultural policy."
"Amendment 4 from the Committee on Agriculture proposes that EUR 9.2 million be set aside in a separate budget instead of being channelled through the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund."
"We can only interpret that as a way of securing budget increases."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report."
"I feel that the prolongation of any proposal seeking to contribute to making the Common Agricultural Policy more precise in its distribution can only be a positive step to ensure a fair deal for Scottish farmers."
"The ability to more accurately estimate yields and make related information more freely available will allow for the improvement of a policy that so far lacks an image of fairness, transparency and environmental sensitivity."
"in writing. - (FR) Based on the excellent report by my German colleague Kurt Lechner, I approve the adoption by the European Parliament, at second reading of the codecision procedure, of a legislative resolution on the Council common position for adopting a directive on the harmonisation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning credit for consumers and replacing the 1987 Community framework, amended on two occasions."
"I welcome the European Commission's desire to establish the conditions for a genuine internal market in consumer credit, to guarantee a high level of consumer protection and to clarify Community regulations by recasting the three existing directives of 1987, 1990 and 1998 on this type of credit."
"I welcome the important work done by my French colleague Jean-Paul Gauzès, who by the wisdom and strength of his convictions has made a substantial contribution to this important compromise, which is so valuable for economic growth, consumer protection and credit institutions."
"in writing. - (FR) After five years of discussions, European consumers will soon have identical information about consumer credit, enabling them to make better comparisons with foreign offers when buying a car, a dishwasher or a sofa bed."
"Although Europeans already have the ability to take out bank loans abroad to buy consumer goods, few use it: less than 1% of the total amount of this type of credit is currently borrowed abroad."
"However, rates currently vary by up to 100% (Portugal 12%, Finland 6%)!"
"The major obstacles identified are the language barrier, distance and the lack of consumer confidence."
"The directive, which I support, should help to increase this confidence, keep consumers better informed and facilitate their choices, while enabling them to benefit from uniform rules of protection (early repayment, right of withdrawal, etc.)."
"Two questions, to conclude:"
"Are we not in danger of encouraging people to take on too much debt if we do not further strengthen the conditions for lenders to check consumers' creditworthiness?"
"Do we not urgently need to open the way for cross-border competition in property loans?"
"This vote relates to the second reading of the proposal initially made by the European Commission in 2002."
"These compromises are aimed at reaching agreement with the Council on a text that would repeal the current Directive 87/102/EEC and introduce a common legal framework for consumer credit agreements."
"The idea is to facilitate the opening-up of national markets and to promote cross-border consumer credit operations, with the aim of stepping up competition and 'improving' the internal market."
"Among other things, it lays down the formula for calculating the annual percentage rate of charge (APR), the conditions in the event of early repayment and information to be given to consumers regarding credit agreements."
"We voted in favour of the proposals that are designed to offer better consumer protection, which is especially important in Portugal, where families' indebtedness is constantly on the rise, exceeding 124% of available income, and where the major financial groups are making scandalous profits."
"We voted against all the proposals for facilitating the opening-up of financial markets and cross-border credit, designed to remove barriers to the entry of the major financial groups rather than to protect consumers."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report proposing the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States on consumer credit."
"Although European households already have the ability to take out bank loans abroad to buy consumer goods, few use it."
"Problems of language, distance and lack of confidence are the biggest obstacles."
"The new directive will increase the transparency of the market for the benefit of consumers for credit of between 200 and 75 000 euros."
"Consumers will have the information they need to choose in full knowledge of the facts, if they decide to buy across borders."
"In the case of credit offers, the information given to consumers will be contained in a new European credit information form."
"Consumers will also eventually benefit from a single annual percentage rate comparable throughout the EU."
"The directive will give consumers good quality basic information that is easy to compare."
"The right of withdrawal and the right of early repayment without paying excessive costs, as well as the transparent presentation of their rights and obligations, will give them the confidence necessary to compare prices."
"in writing. - (FR) The compromise on which Parliament must give its opinion is certainly an improvement on the position of the Council, but it is still deficient on many key points concerning consumer credit contracts."
"The lower limit of 200 euros, the amount of credit from which the directive applies, is in my opinion much too low given the standard of living in most Member States."
"Similarly, it is not necessary to harmonise the provisions governing compensation for early repayment."
"The differences between the Member States are too great."
"The 'compromise' negotiated by the Council is merely the addition of various national provisions, and introduces more complications than harmonisation."
"In my opinion, the directive is much too bureaucratic, for companies, credit institutions and consumers."
"The minimum amount of information it provides for is too great and too indigestible."
"It is in danger of spreading confusion among well-informed consumers."
"in writing. - (NL) The result of today's vote in the European Parliament means that, after a good five years, an agreement has been reached on the consumer credit directive."
"The dialogue between the European Commission, the Council and Parliament was still fruitless at the end of last week, as the rapporteur had prohibitive objections to a compromise proposal concerning early repayment that all the other parties were prepared to accept."
"The compromise subsequently reached between negotiators from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which was also acceptable to the European Commission and the Council, has today received broad support from Parliament."
"I am pleased that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has now decided to support the compromise, as I am convinced that it represents the best that could be reached for consumers and industry."
"I would like to thank everyone concerned, particularly the rapporteur, for their commitment throughout the process."
"Consumer and housing loans in Greece have reached 95 billion euros: consumer credit is growing at the highest rate of any country in the Euro area, and is approaching the EU's annual budget total."
"This is a sign of increasing poverty."
"Two million households are borrowers, of which 3-4% are unable to service their debt."
"In most cases the debt exceeds 40% of income, which results in constant repossessions by bailiffs."
"The same is also true for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are forced to resort to borrowing."
"The banks ruthlessly pocket enormous profits from high interest rates on loans and low interest rates on deposits, unlawful and irregular deductions and charges, misleading advertising, etc., leading to workers going ever further into the red."
"The EU supports financial institutions by guaranteeing profits and by alleviating the consequences of its unpopular policy, which restricts the buying power of workers and decreases their quality of life."
"The proposed directive safeguards the principle of the freedom to draw up contracts, despite unequal negotiating capacities."
"It strengthens financial capital by transferring responsibility to the consumer."
"It safeguards against compensation for early repayment, promotes the harmonisation of legislative provisions and the opening up of national markets in the consumer credit sector, and is deliberately complex and unintelligible for borrowers."
"The Members from the ΚΚΕ (Communist Party of Greece) are voting against the strengthening of financial credit and campaigning for a genuine people's economy for the benefit of workers."
"in writing. - The call for a harmonisation of the laws on consumer credit across Europe is one that I agree with."
"The report not only creates an internal market in credit for consumers but also outlines a set of requirements to ensure a fair deal for both the consumer and creditors."
"The rules in this area need to be consumer friendly, especially on the subject of early repayment and compensation, and in my opinion the report adequately addresses these concerns."
"The harmonisation of advertising will also help ensure that customers across Europe are equally well informed when taking consumer credit related decisions."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the compromise the PSE Group reached with the Council (Amendment 46), because it allows the balances struck during the German Presidency last spring to be maintained."
"I am pleased that the consumer credits defined in this draft directive have a minimum of 200 euros and a maximum of 75 000 euros."
"However, I would have preferred the upper limit to be set at 50 000 euros."
"I am particularly pleased about the qualified majority obtained in plenary to ensure that the interests of consumers are clearly protected in the event of early repayment of the credit."
"The compensation banks may demand will be strictly controlled and may be prohibited for credits of less than 10 000 euros."
"In any case, the fight against people taking on too much debt should remain a priority and resorting to credit should be done in a reasonable manner."
"It is an illusion to think that you can revive consumption through credits to households: this approach leads only to poverty for the most vulnerable consumers."
"The revival of growth through consumption is achieved by raising pay and not by increasing available credit!"
"in writing. - (FR) The report by Mr Lechner on opening up the European consumer loans market was adopted today."
"It seems to me that changing a market that until now has been strongly national into a European market, while maintaining a high level of consumer protection, is the first step towards harmonising the rules on consumer credit."
"The risk for consumers of getting into debt remains far too high."
"Control and transparency by setting up databases of the creditworthiness of every consumer seems essential."
"Like most of my colleagues, however, I voted against Amendment 29 on Article 16, and I am pleased it was rejected."
"To my mind, this point genuinely penalised consumers who decide to repay their loan early."
"Offering consumers the possibility of paying off a loan before its term constitutes a good initiative."
"It should not be spoiled by giving the lender the option of claiming compensation for any costs where this is not fair or justified."
"It was therefore necessary to set limits."
"The lender will not therefore be able to claim compensation of more than 1% of the value of the credit."
"in writing. - (PT) A common legal framework for consumer credit must lay down clear, simple and concise rules, so as to offer European added value with the aim of promoting the internal market."
"Today, therefore, I would like to congratulate Parliament for the positive agreement reached on this legislation."
"I regard the opening up of the national markets to consumer credit as very important since it will step up competition, with very positive consequences for consumers."
"With this new proposal the EU is clearly favouring competition between financial institutions and is introducing the necessary transparency for the disclosure of pre-contractual and contractual information on the provision of credit, data which I regard as fundamental for consumer protection, and also possibly enabling interest rates to be reduced on account of the increased supply, especially on smaller markets."
"The credit ceilings laid down under this agreement are also a very positive aspect for the Portuguese market."
"I am convinced that the new framework will facilitate more credit opportunities, as there is currently a need to ensure proper protection for consumers and their creditworthiness, preventing excessive exposure to debt, in the context of a healthy social policy."
"The advantages are to be benefited from and not for solving problems by creating new ones."
"in writing. - (FR) It is a highly controversial directive, 'on ice' for almost six years, that the European Parliament passed today."
"Yet, it is a text very close to the hearts of Europeans because it provides for the harmonisation of the consumer credit market."
"This market is worth 800 billion euros (two out of three Europeans use credit to buy furniture, a television or a car), and interest rates currently vary from 6% (in Finland) to more than 12% (in Portugal), and yet transactions have so far been mainly national; less than 1% of credits are currently cross-border."
"The directive opens up European borders to consumers looking for the best credit deals: they can choose the best offer and be guaranteed the same rights and the same standards of information, comparison and, above all, protection against getting into too much debt."
"Assessing the creditworthiness of the borrower, free and fast information in the event of refusal and the 14-days right of withdrawal in principle are some of the main objectives of the directive."
"However, one regret, and it is a big one, is the lack of clarity surrounding early repayment terms."
"Heavily penalising consumers who repay early would make the other advantages of harmonisation completely pointless!"
"in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Lechner report on consumer credit."
"I believe that it is vital for the European Union to equip itself with a general reference framework designed to protect citizens in a sector which has grown significantly in recent years."
"In Italy, in particular, growth in turnover in consumer credit agreements has been exponential."
"Very often consumers, sometimes in the wake of seductive advertising campaigns, have entered into them without being fully aware of their rights and the contractual terms, and have then found themselves bound by a whole set of conditions and obligations."
"Within this context I therefore stress the advisability of increasing consumer protection, including through this directive."
"I am voting in favour of Kurt Lechner's report on the recommendation for second reading on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on credit agreements for consumers and repealing Council Directive 87/102/EEC."
"I feel that the compromise reached during successive negotiations is satisfactory."
"The solution proposed is aimed at simplifying the procedure for granting credit and making it easier for consumers to gain access to credit throughout the European Union."
"Harmonisation and unification of standards will lead to enhanced competitiveness between the institutions that make credit available, will cut costs and will also create a true internal market in the sphere of consumer credit."
"in writing. - (FR) The vote on the draft directive on consumer credit denotes significant progress in the eyes of French MPs from the UMP [Union pour un Mouvement Populaire/Union for a Popular Movement]."
"Indeed, thanks to the contribution made by the European Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Lechner, the final text encourages the opening of borders in an important area of daily life, while preserving the existing rights of consumers, notably French consumers."
"The transposition of the directive will therefore make it possible to offer better credit conditions in future, and to limit the risk of people taking on too much debt."
"in writing. - (FR) Six years after the arrival of the euro, Europe still did not have a single market in terms of banking that would benefit consumers and give them a more tangible experience of the advantages of the single currency."
"Information about interest rates and credit terms and conditions will be standardised to make it easier to compare offers."
"Consumers will thus be able to choose in full knowledge of the facts, and obtain the best credit terms."
"Lenders will also have to give consumers clear information about the advantages and disadvantages of their credit offers."
"The questions of the right of withdrawal in the case of linked credit (immediate delivery of the goods) and of the amount of the penalties imposed if the credit is repaid early are clearly framed."
"These penalties must be 'fair and objectively justified'."
"They may not exceed 1% of the amount of the credit repaid early and will not be permitted on loans at variable rates."
"I am particularly pleased that the Member States can say, as is currently the case in France, that no compensation may be demanded for credits of less than 10 000 euros, and that is why I voted in favour."
"in writing. - (SV) The moderates have voted in favour of the proposal for an EU strategy on the rights of the child."
"We consider that children's rights must be respected in just the same way as human rights and, of course, we support action to combat such things as child pornography and the sexual exploitation of children."
"We must emphasise, however, that many of the points in the report relate to fields which should be regulated on an intergovernmental basis, for example that of adoptions."
"Besides, subjects are covered which are already regulated in existing EC legislation, such as TV advertising and product labelling."
"in writing. - I voted for this report because I believe it makes a good contribution to the fight against all forms of violence and abuse against children, including poverty, discrimination and access to education."
"I particularly welcome EP advocacy of a mechanism whereby suppliers of products manufactured with child labour can be prosecuted in Europe."
"I too urge the Commission to urgently bring forward mechanisms that make the main contractor in a supply-chain liable for violations of UN conventions on child labour."
"However, I deplore the attempts to remove references in the report to adolescents' right to sexual and reproductive health and family planning education and services."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of Roberta Angelilli's report 'Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child' because it is important to draw attention to the fact that many instruments adopted at EU level directly or indirectly affect children's rights."
"I therefore believe that it is essential to establish a legislative framework that recognises the rights of the child so that they can be codified in legal form."
"In this context, this report makes an important contribution towards ensuring that the rights of the child are respected, in that it advocates Community legislation prohibiting all forms of violence against children, and stresses the importance of areas such as education, health, adoption, and combating poverty and discrimination."
"I would also point out that the new Treaty of Lisbon provides a legal basis for the rights of the child, now included in the objectives of the European Union."
"in writing. - (SV) Children's rights are without doubt universal and inviolable rights, and the Junilistan Members are pleased to note that all the EU Member States have ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"This means that we are already bound by international legislation for the protection of children against child labour, trafficking, violence and many other forms of interference in the lives of children."
"Moreover children's rights are an area in Swedish law which uncompromisingly places the child's best interests in the forefront of consideration."
"We have chosen to abstain in the vote on the report for the simple reason that the rapporteur seems to have failed in her report to focus attention on the child's best interests."
"The report focuses almost exclusively on which specific social model the Member States should adopt in their respective countries in order to give effect to whatever the European Parliament thinks is the best solution."
"Everything from banning violence on TV and the sale of violent computer games to forced marriages, illegal adoptions and illegal work is covered in this report."
"Clearly we have voted in favour of the amendments which stress the importance of full compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child as a guarantee of the legal protection and universal human rights of children."
"in writing. - (PT) This report has almost 200 articles and includes some aspects we support and others which we do not."
"Our vote should be understood in the light of that statement."
"However, we should point out that the report fails to address the causes of situations that it sometimes diagnoses."
"The report shirks its responsibilities by failing to criticise the EU's neoliberal policies, which underlie the poverty of millions of people, especially children."
"These policies lead to deep and unacceptable social inequalities, caused by capitalist exploitation and concentration."
"Policies that foster social strife, with the loss of value of workers' wages; easy dismissals and increasingly insecure contractual arrangements; longer and more flexible working hours and the liberalisation and privatisation of public services."
"Policies that have profound adverse consequences on the efficiency and living conditions of workers and their families, and hence of their children."
"The respect and full exercise of the rights of the child requires, among other things, a fair distribution of wealth, jobs with rights, decent wages, shorter working hours, development of strong public systems of social security, health and universal and free education."
"in writing. - While I voted yes on this, I want to clarify my position on paragraph two of the report."
"This states that the IGC decision of 19th October 2007 incorporating children's rights as one of the objectives of the EU in the Treaty of Lisbon provides a new legal basis for children's rights."
"According to Commissioner Fratini's response to my question on this during the plenary debate, Lisbon does not bring in a specific legal base and it is important to clarify this."
"Regarding paragraph 127 I am not supporting this as I do not support a ban on headscarves and hijabs."
"in writing. - (DE) I should like to comment on the Angelilli report on the EU strategy on the rights of the child."
"This is a very good report."
"The radical treatment of the issues of child prostitution and sex tourism is particularly important."
"The victims of these criminal offences can also be found in our own backyards."
"In the border area between Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria, for example, prostitution involving women and increasingly children increased enormously after the opening of the borders."
"However, this subject was not a priority at EU level for a long time."
"Problems central to child prostitution can only be combated at European level (the networking of perpetrators through the Internet and the lack of cooperation regarding cross-border surveillance and law enforcement)."
"The report deals with these areas and incorporates them into a comprehensive strategy."
"Even though there is still a great deal to be done to combat child abuse, it is an encouraging sign."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report because I believe it to be a comprehensive statement, full of good proposals."
"I especially welcome the recognition of a child's right to be involved in decisions that concern them directly and for them to be properly represented in legal or administrative hearings."
"The report is strong on the need for a healthy environment and the right to play."
"It also recognises that those children with the legal right to work should be paid on a basis of equal pay for equal work: too many young people are used to provide a cheap alternative to other workers when they work as well and as hard in many sectors."
"I voted to remove the paragraph referring to encouraging states to outlaw the wearing of the hijab for young girls."
"I believe this to be a misplaced proposal of the Women's Committee, assuming the hijab to be an automatic sign of female subjugation, which it is not."
"Personally, I am offended by seeing pre-pubescent girls wearing clothes with sexual invitations written on them but I would not seek to ban this via a Parliamentary report."
"I am pleased the report passed without that paragraph."
"in writing. - I strongly support the idea of a comprehensive and coherent European strategy on the rights of the child."
"The fight against all forms of violence, poverty and discrimination suffered by children is something that should not simply be treated on a national level."
"The protection of a child's right to education, health and adoption are all rights that Europe as a whole should continue to recognise and protect."
"in writing. - (DE) Violence thrives in parallel societies with an ancient Islamic tradition."
"Children let out the hatred instilled in them for the decadent Western culture in the school playground and on the street or even turn into potential terrorists."
"We have ignored the preliminary warning signs out of a misconceived tolerance and refused to accept what was an explosive momentum."
"The growth in child trafficking and pornography is also alarming; sex offenders, as is generally known, display a high reoffending rate."
"The cover has also been blown in this regard on dubious adoption procedures for children from developing countries, procedures in which there has been no recoil from child trafficking, trade in human organs or prostitution."
"In view of the multitude of orphans waiting for adoption, primarily in the East, and millions of unborn children in Europe, a strict ban on the adoption of non-European children would be a heavy blow against child trafficking, as would the introduction of a Europe-wide sex offenders register and greater penalties for sexual activity with children and for the possession of child pornography."
"Last but not least, domestic violence must also be combated in migrant families and the proportion of foreigners in schools limited in order to defuse spiralling violence."
"in writing. - While the Treaty of Lisbon sets the promotion of children's rights as a broad EU objective, it does not create new legislative powers for this purpose."
"I believe that any movement in this field should be within the existing legal framework."
"There are significant areas in this report which step outside these boundaries."
"Nor is the report offering feasible solutions to children's problems."
"One example is institutionalised care."
"We have voted to restrict this to a temporary measure."
"Yet hundreds of thousands of children throughout Europe are born with or acquire such significant physical or intellectual handicaps that it is a medical or social necessity for them to have long-term institutional care."
"A quadriplegic, spina bifida or hydrocephalus afflicted child can have a life of dignity and happiness with expert staff care and family visits."
"Strengthening the system is the priority, and not its abolition."
"We in Europe are bound to follow the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"This report distorts several important messages contained in the Convention."
"With regret, therefore, I found myself unable to support this report, though I share the concern for children's welfare that its supporters expressed."
"in writing. - (EL) This lengthy report, full of literary rhetoric, attempts to conceal the responsibility of the EU and its Member States for their barbaric policy, which results in the inhuman conditions experienced by children and parents of ordinary families."
"How hypocritical that the EU should show interest in the rights of children while its policy is crushing workers with unemployment, partial employment, a fall in living standards, the privatisation of health and education, and the commercialisation of sport and culture."
"The edifying references to combating violence against children, child pornography, etc. cannot conceal the fact that the system, whose overriding value is profit, treats children themselves as a source of profit."
"It commercialises adoption and drives people into child labour, prostitution and organ trading."
"How dare advocates of the EU talk about the rights of children, when EU/NATO aircraft actually bombed a Belgrade maternity clinic!"
"Let us remember that the European/NATO armed forces are killing thousands of children in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere."
"Let us remember that they are condemning hundreds of thousands of children in Africa, Asia, and across the planet to death from hunger and disease - crimes with regard to which the report remains utterly silent."
"in writing. - (SK) Children are people with their own rights, from the very moment of conception."
"Every child has a right to have a family, which is the basis of his upbringing."
"We must not forget about the street children and the children of migrants, who are also exposed to violence."
"The rights of the child must be the EU's main priority."
"I welcome the initiative to set up a confidential hotline."
"I have expressed my agreement with the EU strategy in the area of children's rights by casting my vote."
"The strategy is dealt with in an excellent report by my colleague Mrs Angelilli, which provides a great deal of useful information."
"We have to realise that we are still lacking the legal basis."
"As part of a long-term strategy, it is therefore necessary to adopt concrete measures in the area of the rights of the child and implement them as quickly as possible."
"Ratification of the Lisbon Treaty will make the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding."
"Its Article 24 deals expressly with the rights of the child."
"In the days ahead we are going to face several challenges: reducing cyber-crime as quickly as possible, putting an end to paedophilia and the sexual abuse of children and minors, and establishing rules for international adoption, which must be in the interest of the child not the adults."
"All forms of violence must be prohibited."
"Now is the time to transform words into actions."
"The EU must listen to the children: they are the foundations of tomorrow's society."
"The European house must be a safe house for children."
"If we have happy children, we will have a happy society."
"In the context of the debate on building a European strategy on the rights of the child, I think we should give priority to the concept of the 'interests of the child', not in opposition to the idea of rights, but to complement them, and also as a guiding theme of the strategy."
"Threats to the rights of the child, in the wider world and throughout Europe, vary in nature and degree."
"While in some places it is a priority to combat poverty and its causes or take action against the use of children as soldiers and for sexual exploitation, in other cases we need to safeguard the right of access to health, protection against sexual abuse or trafficking of children, or the right to be adopted in a timely manner and in accordance with transparent rules, and reinforce the role of the family."
"In all cases, however, the criterion should be 'the child's best interests'."
"That is the standard, the criterion, that should be used to assess the usefulness, necessity and merit of any decision, legislation or action."
"I therefore believe that the most important thing in devising this strategy is to establish this concept, to which the lists of rights must be subordinate, as they are not always reasonable, achievable or appropriate."
"in writing. - (FR) This report has the great merit of clearly defining the rights of the child, but above all of condemning almost exhaustively the dangers children are exposed to: from exposure at an early age to depictions of horror, pornography and violence in the media to honour crimes, forced marriages and genital mutilation on cultural or religious grounds."
"Without actually mentioning the words 'Islam' or 'Islamism', terms that are strictly taboo because political correctness and fear of reprisals totally prohibit any form of comment on this religion, and still less any criticism, the rapporteur still manages under cover of more general comments to condemn within the rules all the discrimination that the practice of Islam engenders. Thus, the banning of girls from taking part in some tuition and sports such as swimming, and all the traditional practices that are barbaric and damaging for young girls of the Muslim religion, are condemned."
"We are delighted by this."
"This report is a first step towards the beginnings of freedom of expression and clear-sightedness."
"We will vote in favour."
"in writing. - (SV) One paragraph was a cause of concern to all groups."
"In paragraph 127 of the original report there was a proposal which called on all the EU Member States to ban the wearing of headscarves and the hijab at school."
"As private individuals we can sympathise with the basic idea, that is to protect the right of children to play freely, take part in school gymnastics and also, as minors, to enjoy a certain protection against the coercive power of parents."
"However, a complicated and sensitive question such as this can hardly be resolved at EU level."
"The nations of Europe balance the rights and responsibilities of children, parents and the State in the light of their own history and political situation."
"We entirely agree that the EU should create a good framework."
"In a reasonable perspective paragraph 127 falls outside any such framework."
"in writing. - I was pleased that the committee and the ensuing report took on board a strong focus on family and recognised the family's position in relation to children."
"I also welcome the strong defence of children in relation to trafficking, institutionalisation, pornography and disability."
"However the report ties EU policy into the UN International Convention on the Rights of the Child which changes competence for children from parents to the state."
"Although not explicitly referred to it is a seismic shift of great concern."
"Despite the positive elements of this report, like those mentioned above, the report was regrettably used to promote the sexual and reproductive rights agenda (which for the UN Convention includes abortion) which was particularly incongruous because we are dealing with children and the protection of children."
"Though I very strongly support all protections for children I found myself unable to support this report."
"in writing. - (NL) Despite the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was signed by many Member States, there are still too many breaches of the basic rights of young people and children."
"Therefore, the Commission's initiative to present a European strategy is very welcome."
"Even though children's rights remain a competence of the nation-states, both the Commission and EP rapporteur, Mrs Angelilli, have highlighted a number of urgent points, such as the combating of all forms of violence and of the poverty and discrimination affecting children, and also respect for the rights of immigrant children."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has managed to add the following points to the report: greater attention to the right of children to participate in decisions that concern them, recognition of a children's ombudsman, prohibition of child labour, equal pay for equal work for those under 18, recognition of the rights of refugee children, and the right to a clean and protected environment."
"I am delighted that Parliament has allocated debating time to this subject, and I fully endorse this report."
"I was unable to support the report on the strategy on the rights of the child, because the Left has succeeded in having as many as five references included to these so-called rights and to reproductive health which, among other things, implies the availability of abortion."
"in writing. - I am in favour of the EU promoting the rights of the child."
"One recent example I would again draw to the Commission's attention is discrimination against children's right to travel with airlines withdrawing facilities for unaccompanied minors to fly."
"If they did the same for the disabled or any other similar group there would (properly) be an uproar, but apparently the EU thinks it is perfectly in order to remove children's rights in this arbitrary way."
"At the same time there has been some controversy over paragraph 127 calling for 'Member States to ban headscarves and the hijab, at least at primary school'."
"I voted against the paragraph because of both the ambiguous wording and the fact that I believe this is too important an issue to be dealt with as a peripheral part of such a report."
"Nevertheless I would be disappointed if such a practice was to become common in Europe's primary schools."
"in writing. - I am the strongest defender of the need to give children a good upbringing in a strong, loving and secure family environment, to protect children from harm and abuse, to give them moral guidance and a first class education, and the best of opportunity in their lives."
"I believe that the role of the state in this is a limited one - it should not seek to abrogate the rights and duties of parents, of the churches and of schools."
"I certainly, therefore, see no reason for the EU to get involved."
"I regret the deletion of the call for a ban on headscarves and the hijab at least at primary school - what hope is there of proper integration into our mainstream western societies if such dress is allowed?"
"I regret also the inclusion of language relating to adolescent sexual 'rights' - a further erosion of the very concept of childhood."
"For these and many other reasons, I voted against the report."
"in writing. - (FR) Based on the excellent report by my German colleague Doris Pack, I voted for the European Parliament resolution on adult learning in response to the Commission's Communication 'Adult Learning: It's never too late to learn'."
"Education and training, particularly adult lifelong learning, are critical factors for achieving the Lisbon Strategy's objectives of raising economic growth, competitiveness and social progress."
"Whether in terms of competitiveness, the social inclusion of adults, or the challenges associated with demographic change, this initiative, which dates back to 2001, is good news for the European Union and its citizens."
"Concerning learning, and more generally, the issues associated with enterprises, I suggest handing the matter over to the social partners who, we constantly need to be reminded, have the legal instruments for constructing European social law under the current treaties, in Article 137 and subsequent articles of the Treaty establishing the European Community, as confirmed by the Treaty of Lisbon currently in the process of being ratified."
"in writing. - I voted for this report because the scale of current economic and social change, the rapid transition to a knowledge-based society and demographic changes resulting from the ageing population in Europe are all challenges which demand a new approach to education and training, within the framework of lifelong learning."
"I voted in favour of the report by Doris Pack on 'Adult learning: it is never too late to learn', because I consider that adult learning, through the acquisition of essential skills, is crucial for achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy of greater economic growth, competitiveness and social inclusion."
"On the other hand, and to complement this I also agree with the viewpoint that lifelong learning is fundamental for facing the current challenges of economic and social change, the rapid transition to a knowledge-based society and demographic changes resulting from an ageing population."
"It is important to pay more attention to adult learning."
"The adult learning agenda needs to be pushed forward."
"Adult participation in education and training is not sufficient if the EU wishes to reach the benchmark goal of 12.5% participation in adult learning by 2010."
"However, it is necessary to ensure the quality of adult learning, paying special attention to the various dimensions of quality in learning, principally the development of educators, quality assurance mechanisms and teaching methods and materials."
"As the report says, adult learning is a vital component of lifelong learning and a very complex sector."
"Adults need to connect learning to their knowledge, experience and cultural background."
"Finally, it is important to emphasise gender equality with regard to programmes relating to lifelong learning, so that both men and women can derive equal advantage from the possibilities offered by such learning, and to make use of all available tools to ensure equality between men and women in measures for preparing adult education policy, in cooperation with the European Institute for Gender Equality."
"in writing. - (SV) We have a high degree of confidence in the Member States' ability to deal with questions concerning the very important issue of adult education."
"It is important that the education departments of the Member States have sufficient funding to develop adult education."
"One way to make financial resources available to them is to reduce contributions of Member States to the EU budget so that they have more money available for investment in social provision, education and welfare."
"We observe once again the failure of the federalist majority in the European Parliament to respect the exclusive competence of the Member States in the organisation of education and the content of training systems."
"This own-initiative report from the European Parliament should never have been written and cannot be seen as anything more than a job-creation scheme for the European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education."
"The report on which we are voting relates to adult education, in other words to a matter which is acquiring immense significance throughout the European Union, but which has become something more than that in my country - it is a beneficial trend and passion for thousands of people."
"This is not always dictated by purely commercial considerations."
"May I draw your attention to one aspect of continuous adult education that is linked to both modern demographic and civilisational challenges and the inheritance of the old order."
"The socialist system enforced a specific educational model which, in the sphere of humanities, was saturated with propaganda and ideology, and in other spheres reflected a detachment from world trends."
"For these reasons, adult education in the new Member States is both a chance to make amends for the weaknesses of the socialist model of education outlined above and at the same time a genuine opening up to the world."
"In the sphere of knowledge of foreign languages, readiness to take the risk of retraining and changing jobs and the promotion of European educational standards, this is an obvious precondition for mobility and the chance of finding employment - which explains the broad interest in continuing education among my peers from Central and Eastern Europe."
"In her report, Mrs Pack calls for education to continue throughout a person's working life, without restricting study to the school years only."
"I agree with the assertion that the current rate of economic and social change is enforcing a need for constant, long-term personal development."
"It is also a fact that adult education has a beneficial impact on adults' sense of their own worth, helps to foster better social integration and builds intercultural dialogue."
"in writing. - I feel that the report's goal of ensuring Member States reach a 12.5% target for participation in adult learning by 2010 will improve not only the EU's competitiveness, but will also allow for greater social inclusion and intercultural awareness: exactly what is needed for the year of intercultural dialogue."
"The greater use of technology and proposals to increase childcare facilities will improve opportunities for everyone to truly benefit from education."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - (DE) It is counterproductive on the one hand to stop one's own population from learning, and on the other hand to come up with plans for a 'blue card', because owing to the increase in atypical relationships and greater competitive pressure, a good basic and continuing education is now no longer any kind of protection against unemployment."
"Enough well-educated people have been rejected by companies simply because the latter are searching for the cheapest McJob graduates or are merely wanting to offer more unusual employment contracts."
"As a matter of principle, the lack of skilled workers used as a pretext for this should be removed."
"If this is not possible preference should be given to a seasonal model."
"Further mass migration can then be prevented."
"Despite the discrepancies displayed in the EU targets, efforts and programmes in the lifelong learning sector still deserve our support."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"That concludes the vote."
"I would like to thank the services, particularly the interpreters, for bearing with us over lunchtime."
"(The sitting was suspended at 13.30 and resumed at 15.00)"
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Situation in Kenya (debate)"
"The next item is the statements from the Council and the Commission concerning the situation in Kenya."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I am very pleased that today the European Parliament is going to discuss the situation in Kenya and also debate the proposed resolution on the current situation there."
"The mere fact that the European Parliament sent the Election Observation Mission under the leadership of Mr Lambsdorff, and its own delegation led by Mr Mulder, gave a very important sign that the European Parliament is interested in the situation in Kenya."
"The elections in Kenya, as we know, took place on 27 December."
"The high turnout of the Kenyan voters is proof of the commitment of the Kenyan people to the democratic process and of the trust in that process."
"The European Union Election Observation Mission was present at the actual location and was led by Mr Lambsdorff."
"It warned of numerous irregularities in the counting and recording of the votes during these elections."
"These irregularities are causing serious doubts about the actual outcome of these elections."
"As we know, after the results were published, violence broke out in the capitol Nairobi and other parts of Kenya."
"Supporters of the opposition leader, Mr Odinge, clashed several times with the security forces and also attacked the followers of President Kibaki."
"Shots were fired by the security forces into the masses."
"According to Louise Arbour, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the security forces responded ""with excessive violence”."
"At least 600 people lost their lives and almost a quarter of a million people were displaced - all this in Kenya, a country to which refugees from the neighbouring countries, Somalia and southern Sudan, usually flee."
"It has affected the economy not only of Kenya itself, but also of the neighbouring countries, especially those without their own access to the sea."
"That is a tragedy."
"At the same time it is a great blow to the process of democratisation and a blow to the whole continent of Africa, where Kenya was regarded as exemplary."
"The European Union condemned the violence in Kenya."
"We appealed to Kenyan leaders to try and answer the doubts about the regularity of the elections, but first of all to establish a dialogue and find a political solution."
"Naturally, we responded to the humanitarian needs of the Kenyan population."
"The European Union saluted the mediation by President Kufuor of Ghana, who is presiding over the African Union."
"We also expressed our support for a group of eminent African personalities led by the former United Nations Secretary General, Mr Kofi Annan, which should arrive in Nairobi shortly."
"In the meantime, President Kibaki has appointed his government without consultation with the opposition leader, Mr Odinga."
"The latter has called for mass demonstrations in Kenya in three days' time."
"On a more positive note, the Kenyan Parliament had its first session yesterday."
"The opposition candidate was elected President of the Parliament."
"This was encouraging in the sense that certain democratic rules have still been observed in the country and that the opposition still has a voice."
"As for the European Union, it is perfectly clear that normal business with Kenya will not be possible until a political compromise is found."
"The compromise must lead to a permanent solution which will uphold the will of the Kenyan people, gain the trust of the Kenyan people and return Kenya to stability."
"In the name of the European Union, I can say that everything that has followed the Kenyan elections has represented a great disappointment and that the situation is still worrying."
"However, this cannot be compared with the disappointment felt by the people of Kenya themselves, people who took part in the elections en masse in the hope of a better future."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that the European Commission is deeply concerned at the serious crisis Kenya is experiencing."
"Furthermore, the day after the elections, when we saw the warning signs of the chaos following what happened particularly during the counting of votes, we mobilised and established contacts with the authorities on both sides - the outgoing majority and the opposition."
"I should also tell you regarding this that I had no trouble getting in direct, personal contact with Mr Odinga."
"On the other hand, since then and despite repeated attempts, I have never been able to make direct, personal contact with Mr Kibaki, which is surprising considering how easy it was to contact him in the past."
"This is fairly indicative of the unease that reigned."
"The post-election violence, which has caused the deaths of more than 600 people and the displacement of more than 250 000, has obviously highlighted the frustration and anger felt by the Kenyan people about the profound problems of socioeconomic inequality and corruption undermining Kenyan society, with the risk of confrontation on ethnic lines. But these elections have also highlighted the democratic aspirations of the Kenyan people."
"These aspirations have been flouted by the irregularities that occurred on election day, which cast serious doubt on the validity of the official results."
"We fully share the conclusions and declarations of the European Union's election observation mission, led by your fellow Member Alexander Lambsdorff, whom I would really like to congratulate for the excellent work he did, to the point that the international authorities outside the EU, which started off in a slightly less categorical position, in some ways a slightly less objective position, ended up supporting Mr Lambsdorff's observations and conclusions and endorsing them."
"The Commission's position with respect to the political situation in Kenya could not be clearer."
"Kenya's political leaders urgently need to size up their responsibilities and immediately and seriously commit themselves to finding a political settlement."
"Without such a commitment, the European Union will undoubtedly have no other option than to review its relations with Kenya, which until now, it has to be said, have been excellent."
"Kenya is a country that was felt to be on the right track in terms of governance, human rights and democracy, and it was also playing an important role in regional stability."
"We need to remember these things."
"Seeking a political settlement is therefore the responsibility first and foremost of the Kenyan leaders."
"It requires an immediate halt to provocation and violence in the streets, but also in the media and in public posturing."
"It is crucial for President Mwai Kibaki, and the opposition leader Raila Odinga, to agree to compromise by recognising that the election result is not correctly reflected in the exercise of power and responsibility, and that there must inevitably be power sharing to avoid the continuation of the political crisis."
"This power sharing could be an interim solution until, for example, new elections could be held."
"Finally, it is important for the Kenyan political class to recognise the pressing need to solve the basic problems at the root of this outburst of violence, whether they are the constitutional organisation of power, the political governance of the country, or the serious discrimination and socioeconomic inequalities."
"The Commission and the European Union as a whole fully support the African mediation launched by President Kufuor and continued by Kofi Annan, thanks to Graça Machel and Benjamin Mkapa."
"They call upon President Kibaki and Raila Odinga to cooperate fully with the aim of finding a political settlement."
"I spoke at length with Desmond Tutu at the start of the crisis, during his mediation mission."
"I also had a very long discussion with Kofi Annan, who indicated that the most appropriate thing would be for African mediation to accompany a process of rapprochement."
"I have promised the Commission's support for this mediation, whether politically or financially."
"Whatever the case, we should be pleased that the speaker of the Kenyan parliament was elected properly last night."
"We should take this as a sign of respect for the constitutional framework, from this point of view at least."
"However, the next few days will be crucial."
"We will be monitoring the situation closely and will remain in constant contact with the African mediators."
"We will adapt our relations with Kenya, including as regards cooperation, to reflect changes in the situation and the actions of both sides."
"All options are currently on the table."
"There needs to be European and international dialogue so that what we do has the maximum impact."
"It seems that the international community is currently on the same wavelength, that there are no longer differences in approach, political tendency, or even strategy."
"This is important."
"It was not necessarily the case at the outset, straight after the elections."
"I think this is something we have now achieved, and it is a good thing."
"As for the humanitarian situation, the Commission has reacted very quickly."
"Following the assessments by experts from ECHO and our partners in the field, the Commission has released initial emergency aid of 5.5 million euros to cope with the needs of displaced people for water, food, shelter and healthcare."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, as has already been said, Kenya has been an important example of democracy and stability in the region since 2002."
"In recent years, the country has made great political and economic strides."
"The Kenyan elections have shown that the vast majority of Kenyans prefer democracy to dictatorship."
"They have shown that they have more faith in elected representatives than in the military."
"Nevertheless, these alarming outbursts of violence have occurred, and there is now a humanitarian crisis that has already left hundreds dead and more than 250 000 refugees."
"This will not be without consequences for the country's economic situation."
"What is to be done?"
"It is important for the European Union to offer its full support to the panel of 'eminent African personalities' appointed by the African Union and headed by Kofi Annan."
"If the past can teach us one thing, it is that we must not think that we - Europe - can solve Africa's problems."
"African problems require African solutions, and I welcome the European Commission's support for this."
"Mr President, our group fully supports the resolution."
"I do have one more thing to get off my chest, however: something that our group considers extremely regrettable."
"This is that, one day after the elections - that is, at a time when the outcome had been decided and, as the Commissioner has said, irregularities had already abounded - the European Commission transferred more than 40 million euros to the government in budget aid."
"It did not even await the findings of our own observation team - which, incidentally, were published just three days later."
"This political decision cannot be justified on the technicality that the payment had already been delayed once, until after the elections, and that it was just the third in a series of payments."
"This payment could have and should have been deferred."
"This was an extremely unfortunate decision, all the more so because the Member States themselves had already suspended their aid."
"This must not happen again."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, additional proof that the majority of the Kenyan people did not support President Kibaki is that in the parliamentary elections, which were held at the same time as the presidential elections, Mr Odinga's opposition party won more than twice as many votes as Mr Kibaki's party."
"As we know, this enabled Mr Odinga's party to win the post of speaker when Parliament opened yesterday in Nairobi."
"Meanwhile, 22 of Mr Kibaki's ministers, who aspired to be MPs, were defeated at the elections."
"President Kibaki is, in my view, responsible for a great deal, not only because of the electoral fraud."
"His five years in government have led to frustration, disillusionment and deception."
"It is true that the economy has grown by 6%, but more than half the population is still living below the poverty line."
"Also, several cabinet ministers, appointed by Mr Kibaki in a clear act of provocation, have been linked with cases of corruption."
"This President, who is fraudulently seeking to remain in power, is also responsible for another serious matter: his action has caused a resurgence in inter-ethnic conflict, a spiral that may be difficult to contain."
"As if this were not enough, as you know, two weeks ago the Chairman of the Kenyan Electoral Commission stated no less than that he did not know who had won the presidential elections."
"In view of all this, in my opinion it makes perfect sense, as paragraph 11 of the joint motion for a resolution of Parliament states, to demand that new elections be called if it is impossible for an independent institution to organise a clean, transparent and credible recount of the votes cast in the 27 December elections."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to the Council, the Commission and also to my fellow Members here in the European Parliament."
"There is great unity among the institutions."
"This makes me personally very happy and I say this also on behalf of my team of more than 150 election observers, at least 50 of whom have been stationed in Kenya for over a month."
"Our unity here is a good sign."
"Some of these observers - I want to state this here - are now on their way to Pakistan, or have already arrived there, where the next difficult election is pending."
"Election monitoring is sometimes a difficult and dangerous job."
"I should like to thank these people most sincerely for their commitment to this."
"Whatever you stand for, Europe is the common value."
"We can be proud - as the Commissioner has just said - that other monitoring missions have subscribed to our judgment, for instance the Commonwealth Delegation and the International Republican Institute from the United States."
"I believe the work of the monitoring mission has therefore established a basis for a joint effort in which the European Union, Africa and the United States all pull together in order to reach a solution to the crisis in Kenya."
"In its resolution the European Parliament will highlight the paths it considers appropriate."
"As chief observer, I have not taken part in these consultations myself."
"The neutrality of our mission must, in my view, be unequivocally preserved to the end."
"To the end means until our final report, which we are presently compiling, is submitted."
"Together with the professional work of our observers in the field, the resulting neutrality was our strongest asset."
"Neutrality and professionalism also include the fact that we work only on the basis of proof."
"In our conclusion we discovered that there is scepticism about the result of the presidential election."
"As a monitoring mission, we have never said that a particular candidate has won the elections."
"What we have said is that it is not possible to establish who the winner is."
"I would like to quote something in English from the Kenyan election observers, who write as follows:"
"'In our view, considering the entire electoral process, the 2007 general elections were credible in as far as the voting and counting process is concerned."
"The electoral process lost credibility towards the end with regard to the tallying and announcement of presidential results.'"
"That statement comes from the national Kenyan observers, who stationed between 16 000 and 20 000 people there."
"It is entirely consistent with our findings."
"I now wish to say something that applies to me, to the team and to everyone: we are hoping for a rapid settlement of the crisis, an end to the violence and for the refugees to return to their homeland as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, Commissioner, Kenya is more than just the problem of President Kibaki's electoral abuses."
"We are dealing here with a humanitarian crisis for the civilian population."
"The most dramatic situation seems to be happening in Eldoret, in the Holy Spirit Catholic Church in Langas."
"There we are dealing with numerous murders set against a political and ethnic background."
"Many Kenyans have been driven out of their family homes, which have then been burned down."
"On 1 January 2008 more than 3 000 people were taking refuge in the parish of Langas."
"The refugees are deprived of food, clean water and sanitation."
"On 2 January this year the Catholic Missionary Service News Agency, MISNA, reported that between 7 000 and 10 000 people were taking refuge in the cathedral in Langas."
"What is needed is not only political mediation, but also action to guarantee that no outburst of ethnic and religious hatred will be permitted."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I think that in view of the current situation, the European Union should make an effort to assert its credibility as regards the observation missions it sends to these countries."
"For if it is observed quite seriously, as was the case, that the result is clearly fraudulent, that the president cannot be considered the legitimately elected president, the European Union should then be consistent in its policy and start, at the very least, by not recognising the president, in this case Mr Kibaki."
"Secondly, the EU should propose and ensure, as rapidly as possible, that new presidential elections are held that will enable the president to be properly elected, honestly this time."
"Sadly, we have precedents, notably in Ethiopia where the President also used force to get himself into office, despite the evidence of fraud followed by much repressive violence."
"The European Union's acceptance of this fait accompli helps to undermine the value of sending observation missions."
"What is the point of sending European observation missions with the seriousness and commitment of all our colleagues in this area to make conclusions that are unanimously recognised by everyone, if in the end we lie low and a few months later accept a coup by a president who will not even listen?"
"Would we accept this kind of situation in our own countries?"
"Obviously not."
"Therefore we cannot, in terms of the democracy and electoral processes we support, have double standards, one applying in the European Union and the other fluctuating in line with peoples' interests in these regions."
"The Kenyan people, I believe, want to get to the bottom of this situation and are calling for new elections to make things perfectly clear."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are certainly all agreed that the events in Kenya are tragic and that there must categorically be an end to today's continuing violence."
"The crisis in Kenya is fundamental and in my view not merely political in nature."
"To all intents and purposes, it can also have an impact on the situation in Africa's neighbouring countries."
"It is true that there are rabble-rousers in Kenya trying to invoke hatred between ethnic groups in order to gain power."
"But if, for example, you read the free Kenyan press these days, it is very heartening to see how many journalists are constantly striving to stand up for unity in the country and for unity among the Kenyan people and are turning against the fragmentation of society."
"The problem primarily is that it has not been possible to allow broad sections of the Kenyan population to have a share in the Kenyan economic boom and that violence is able to spread on this basis."
"In the context of our development cooperation, we should rather emphasise the fact that a real attempt is being made here to bring about change and in particular, to carry out a practical campaign against poverty in Kenya."
"I also think that holding discussions about the cancellation of budget support for Kenya is a problem, because this fuels anxiety about the future in Kenya."
"I specifically welcome the fact, Commissioner Michel, that the EU is clearly on the side of Kofi Annan and other mediators from the African Union in helping to resolve these processes in Kenya and with African politicians."
"- (LV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to commend the high level of activity among the citizens of Kenya on election day."
"The elections were characterised by high rates of participation and patience on the part of citizens, regardless of the long queues and technical problems in certain districts."
"The situation regarding the production of presidential election results was, unfortunately, entirely different."
"The requisite transparency was not achieved."
"The many breaches and discrepancies in information cast doubt upon the election results announced."
"Unfortunately, the impression has been given that the results were produced according to the principle that it is not how you vote that is important, but rather how we count the votes."
"If it is not possible to carry out a reliable and transparent review of the votes, then the presidential elections in Kenya should be held again."
"After the announcement of the election results the already tense atmosphere unfortunately turned violent."
"The most urgent priority now is to stop the violence and avert a humanitarian crisis."
"The European Union must support the mission led by the African Union and Kofi Annan to mediate between the President and the opposition, in order to stop the violence and find a solution to the political crisis."
"If necessary, the European Union ought to be ready to continue this mediation."
"Certainly, the European Union must grant Kenya the humanitarian aid needed to relieve the situation of the many thousands of displaced persons who, because of violence, have been forced to abandon their homes."
"Humanitarian aid should, however, be provided in such a way that it really reaches displaced persons and there is proper control over the way in which funds are used."
"From this viewpoint, the European Commission's decision, one day after the elections, to transfer 40 million euros of budget support to the Kenyan government without taking into account the criticisms of European Union observers regarding the conduct of the elections, is questionable."
"Budget support unfortunately does not ensure rigorous control of the use of funds, and the provision of such assistance to a president and a government that have reached power in questionable elections ought to be carefully evaluated."
"I call on the European Commission to assess this case and to inform the European Parliament of the measures taken to prevent a recurrence of such a situation."
"Mr President, clearly we need to identify the fact that Kenya is a country where most people are actually subsisting on a couple of dollars a day."
"There is massive discontent and deprivation; a whole army of discontented people, as we have seen, has been engendered by the situation there, because what they realise is that the gap between the haves and the have-nots in Kenya has widened - and that in the context of that 6% growth in GDP which others have mentioned."
"Kenya is a low-income, low-resource economy."
"It is also a country which, tragically, is mired in patronage and in corruption."
"And what we see is that, as we speak here today, people are storing up food, and people are out on the streets again in Nairobi and in other parts of Kenya."
"Therefore I would add my voice to those that have said that the EU must suspend budget support to Kenya until a political resolution to the present crisis has been found."
"Of course, it is unacceptable that that EUR 40.6 million was sent the day after the election criticisms were made."
"I am very encouraged that Commissioner Michel intimated in our committee on Monday that budget support would be reviewed immediately."
"I would like to hear some more detail of that."
"Instead of channelling money through line ministries in Kenya, we must look at ways of doing it through project support, which also ensures that the poor of Kenya are not damaged by such an action."
"In my view we need to be much clearer about the need to place aid conditionality on good governance, as is clearly stated under the Cotonou Partnership Agreements, and we have not done that."
"We have, I am afraid, turned a blind eye to many of the serious accusations about corruption in that country."
"Finally, the perpetrators of those irregular election results that the observers have reported to us must be held to account and must not be allowed to get away with it."
"I also say that the European Union must play its part in monitoring the mediation process."
"We have been at the vanguard of asking for these considerations to be made, and I would like the Council and the European Union to be stronger and more consistent in its approach, and make sure that Kofi Annan is given all the support he needs from Europe, and that a new Election Commission can be put in place as soon as possible."
"(ES) Mr President, we Europeans cannot just say that we are very concerned but we very much hope that things will return to normal, because a return to normality at the price of accepting the fraudulent victory of Mr Kibaki is not a solution that we can accept."
"In too many African countries, rigged elections have robbed citizens of all faith and hope in the democratic system."
"Another case of this, this time in Kenya, would be lethal for the democratic hopes of Africa."
"The solution can only come from strong external pressure."
"Without strong external pressure the two leaders will not reach any kind of agreement, and we need to tell Mr Kibaki clearly that his Government is illegal and act accordingly."
"Otherwise, our electoral observation missions would be pointless."
"We have talked about the responsibilities of the African people, but we should also remember our own responsibilities."
"For too long we have closed our eyes to what was going on in Kenya."
"For too long we have sung the praises of that country as an example of democracy, forgetting the social inequalities and the corruption that was rife throughout the country: 16 billion dollars in aid have been received by that country since independence and there have been just four presidents."
"Kenya is paying very dearly for the protection and support that we have given to its poor governments, without denouncing them."
"We cannot close our eyes this time."
"(NL) Mr President, today has seen further serious police violence against demonstrators."
"There have been further deaths in Kenya."
"Can there be an end to this tension without renewed presidential elections?"
"I doubt it."
"At all events, an independent investigation into this electoral fraud is required, the outcome of which must be respected by all parties even if it means new elections."
"Kenya is running tremendous risks."
"It is in the interest of all Kenyans, of the region and even of the EU itself that the unrest is brought to an end."
"To reject dialogue now would be irresponsible."
"Moreover, one thing is clear: further budget aid to an undemocratic government such as this is out of the question."
"Kofi Annan has been taken ill, and rarely has a bout of flu come at a worse moment."
"Nevertheless, the EU must lose no time in fully supporting his mission and offering technical and financial assistance where necessary."
"Naturally it is the African leaders who must mediate in the first instance but, if the situation threatens to escalate further before Mr Annan's arrival, the EU itself will have to be ready to join with the African Union in sending a high-level delegation to Nairobi without delay."
"Kenya must not become another Somalia."
"It is not yet too late."
"Mr President, I agree with Mr Borrell Fontelles that, if any good has come out of the post-election situation in Kenya, it is that it has revealed that the so-called Kenyan success story is built on a foundation of straw."
"While it is true that the thirst among ordinary Kenyans for democracy is strong and that Kenya has been going through a great economic boom, it is equally clear that for years a government overseeing that economic boom has failed to ensure that the whole of its population has benefited economically and socially."
"We now know that there is deep-rooted social and economic disarray in the country and that for years the Government has operated on a basis of corruption and economic mismanagement."
"The concept, as Mrs Kinnock rightly says, of good governance and respect for democracy are prerequisites for European Union aid."
"But, contrary to what other speakers have said, that does not mean that we should abandon the country."
"It means we should rechannel our aid through agencies and organisations that can get money to the poor, the neediest and the weakest in Kenya."
"Clearly, if the election results are not properly monitored and respected, we cannot continue to channel money through the Kenyan Government."
"We have to send a clear message: good governance is a prerequisite for assistance from the European Union."
"Mr President, this situation, as all the others have said, is very tragic: it resembles very much what happened a few years ago in Addis Ababa."
"I doubt whether a solution can be found without new elections."
"But, ideally, a solution should now be found through dialogue in Kenya, preferably supported by the African Union."
"But, so far, we have seen very little progress."
"Time is short: the fabric of the country is disintegrating as we speak."
"We cannot be bystanders if the situation is not resolved."
"To suspend aid is a must under the present circumstances."
"Moreover, if reconciliation fails, the EU has to step in to offer its services to mediate."
"Is the Council, is the Commission prepared to do that?"
"In the longer-term perspective, I would submit that we have to seriously reconsider not only our development cooperation but in particular our governance programme, and in particular help political parties to become real parties and, in addition to that, strengthen the institution of the Kenyan Parliament, because that is a key problem right now."
"Mr President, as someone who has visited Kenya previously and in particular the slum areas in Nairobi, I am familiar with the corruption that was in place even prior to this election."
"I condemn the tragic loss of up to 600 lives, and the critical humanitarian situation which has ensued after the 27 December elections in Kenya."
"I call on the relevant authorities and stakeholders to do their utmost to bring peace to Kenya and ensure that human rights and the rule of law are respected."
"It is most unfortunate that Kenya, being one of the most stable and economically-developed nations in East Africa, has now descended into such chaos, as this will most likely have detrimental knock-on effects on its neighbouring countries."
"The EU election observation mission concluded that the lack of transparency and adequate security procedures severely undermined the credibility of the presidential election results."
"Today, Mr Odinga's opposition party has called once again for nationwide protests regarding the outcome of last month's presidential election."
"These opposition rallies are due to last for three days, despite a government ban."
"Such protests could lead to further bloodshed."
"Many of the killings seem to have been based purely on ethnic differences, the most horrendous of which was the brutal attack on a church near the town of Eldoret, which is thought to have left more than 30 ethnic Kikuyu dead."
"I urge Mr Kibaki to respect his country's democratic commitments as enshrined in Kenya's national Constitution and the guidelines of the African Charter of Human and People's Rights."
"I call on the Presidency of the EU and the European Commission to monitor closely the mediation mission that will be led by Mr Annan later this week and, if required, to ensure an immediate continuation of these mediation efforts by a high-level EU delegation, possibly a joint EU-AU initiative."
"- (DE) Mr President, I should like to follow up on the question from my colleague Glenys Kinnock to Commissioner Michel."
"What are the main points?"
"How can we visualise this?"
"In what direction is budget support being modified?"
"One extra question: I assume that arrangements are already in place in the current budget support system for support to be suspended in such a situation as that which prevailed in Kenya after the elections?"
"(NL) Mr President, we all agree that what has clearly gone wrong in Kenya is the presidential election procedure."
"What have gone relatively well, however, are the parliamentary elections, the elections for members of the national parliament."
"I agree with Commissioner Michel that yesterday's developments in the Kenyan Parliament are encouraging: the speaker has been elected - the parties and the opposition have been sufficiently powerful to push through the elections for the new speaker."
"I therefore believe that the European Parliament must do everything possible to support parliamentary democracy in Kenya and strengthen it where possible."
"The budget aid that was granted exactly one day after the elections has drawn criticism from many quarters of this House."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner the following question - even though this is probably not officially allowed."
"Would he be inclined to make future decisions to grant budget aid dependent on the European Parliament's opinion?"
"In my view, it is not for a small group of officials in the European Development Fund Committee to take such a decision; instead, the Commissioner should first seek the European Parliament's opinion."
"I would like to have a clear answer to this question."
"- (PL) Mr President, the example of Kenya shows what a breakdown in democratic standards can lead to, and how important it is for elections to be free, transparent, honest and fair."
"People who have lost elections, regardless of whether they lost in honest rivalry or whether they were cheated by those who organised the election process, should nevertheless not pursue violence and destruction."
"Randomly hurting people, including women and children, has nothing in common with acceptable forms of struggle for one's rights."
"The only hope for an effective solution to problems of this type lies in convincing the rulers and the opposition that the overriding aim of politics is not to acquire or hold onto power; the aim of politics is the good of the people."
"A return to normal for Kenya must therefore begin with a suspension of violence and destruction."
"I appreciate that this is the aim of mediators from the African Union, and the European Union should support this process."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Michel for making such a declaration."
"- (DE) Mr President, it is not only recently that the extent of corruption in Kenya has become evident and as a result, many Member States - actually all Member States - have stopped budget support in the last few years and even switched over to project aid."
"This is actually one of the points of criticism I would like to address to the Commission, since the Commission has apparently not made the Member States aware of these concerns and has carried on with the budget support."
"I, too, am now in favour of continuing the support in an appropriate form, but not in a form that would give the previous structures the opportunity to administer the money via budget support."
"I am also very much in favour of in future supporting the institution that has now been authorised, in other words the Kenyan Parliament."
"We cannot automatically assume that all Members of Parliament behave properly and that there is no prevailing corruption."
"I have no illusions about this."
"Nevertheless, we should channel a large proportion of support into Kenya's political institutions, into promoting its Parliament and our colleagues' capacity for work."
"Then we shall have the opportunity to enable these newly-authorised colleagues to govern Kenya more effectively in future than the current government has managed to do."
"Mr President, I think it is generally accepted that the recent presidential elections in Kenya were flawed."
"I think that is a great pity because Kenya is a country that has been politically stable for many decades."
"Sadly that has changed in the last two weeks and we have seen over 600 people killed and 250 000 people have been displaced."
"Unfortunately, again, that violence is ethnic in nature."
"The question now is, what can the international community and ourselves do to bring political stability back to Kenya before the situation deteriorates further?"
"Constructive political dialogue between both sides must be a key priority, and I would agree with other speakers that yesterday was a positive day in the Kenyan Parliament."
"Without political engagement, however, there will be no agreement, and the European Union is urging its political talks."
"I am delighted to see that Kofi Annan and the Presidents of Tanzania and Uganda will be there shortly to try and broker some sort of deal."
"Many of the people who have been displaced have gone into Uganda, which means there have already been effects on the regions surrounding Kenya."
"With regard to aid and the European Union increasing its level of financial support for humanitarian programmes in Kenya, I would be interested to hear Commissioner Michel's answer on how exactly that money will be spent and to make sure it has been spent correctly, as raised by previous speakers."
"I think we all should remember - and particularly the Kenyan people and the politicians should remember - that history has shown, time and time again, that, where there is a political vacuum, that vacuum can often be filled by extremists, but the people of Kenya deserve better."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I will first quickly mention not the 30 million but the 40.6 million euros that constituted the payment, several months ago, of the second tranche of the 120-million-euro programme known as 'Poverty Reduction Budget Support'."
"The payment decision had been delayed to await the results and recommendations of the third review of the PRBS programme by the International Monetary Fund."
"These results have been known since early November and in November, on the basis of the International Monetary Fund's favourable opinion, the Commission approved in principle the payment of a sum of 40.6 million euros by letter to the Kenyan Finance Minister."
"However, taking account of the electoral context and the risk of the government using this payment for electioneering, the Commission decided, in consultation with the Member States, not to make the payment before the elections but after they had taken place, by the cut-off date of 31 December for financial commitments in accordance with the applicable procedures."
"That is why, technically, the payment was made on 28 December."
"I understand the upset this is causing, but just to remind you, it was only from the evening of Friday 28 and Saturday 29 December that the irregularities started to appear, when the transmission of the results from the last 49 constituencies, out of a total of 210, were subject to abnormal delays and, as you know, it was only on Monday 1 January, on the basis of the weekend's events, that the EU election observation mission reported in its preliminary analysis that the elections had not met international standards."
"Therefore, it was technically too late to prevent or block the payment of this sum of 40.6 million euros."
"Secondly, I would like to mention - because it is important from the point of view of the argument - that I agree with many of the things that have been said, but that there are also things I do not agree with at all."
"When someone suggests that the technique or method of budget support is a method or technique on which there are no conditions or controls, that is obviously wrong."
"I would just like to draw attention to the fact that before we suddenly suspend budget support we should first check that the proposal, made by Mrs Kinnock and others, to convert budget support into project support, is feasible quickly, or as quickly as budget support allows, so as not to put the people in an even more catastrophic situation of deprivation."
"Indeed, it is easy to affirm principles, but we still need to make sure that the results and consequences of implementing them do not help to make the situation even worse."
"That brings me to two thoughts on budget support."
"Budget support is controlled."
"There is evidence to be provided, and it is no less transparent than the project support system."
"Of course, Mrs Kinnock and others, it goes without saying that if a settlement is not reached quickly between the parties to restore calm and, I hope, to agree on the possible organisation of new elections, as Mr Wittmann wishes, budget support, which to some extent qualifies the countries it is used for as meeting certain standards, certainly will not be able to be used any more and it will be necessary to find other means of providing support."
"However, I do not agree that we should just suspend development aid to Kenya."
"We always need to remember that behind this aid there are people who benefit from it."
"I wanted to clarify this and I believe it was important."
"A last response, finally, to two other points."
"Do elections need to be organised straight away?"
"I think it would be desirable for the parties to reach an agreement."
"We can express all the wishes in the world, but believing that elections will be organised immediately without agreement between the parties is unrealistic."
"Care also needs to be taken not to encourage situations to develop that make the people's difficulty and misfortune even worse."
"This is something we should not lose sight of, and I think we need to act with great caution."
"I am in favour of elections, provided that they come out of a settlement."
"We will fully support the African mediation and, of course, as the Council said, the Commission is available for a mediation mission."
"I made contact with Kofi Annan and had a long discussion with him."
"I told him we were available - including the High Representative - for mediation work."
"Clearly what is now hoped for is that it can primarily be African mediation."
"It seems to me that this is something we cannot lose sight of."
"In closing, my last comment in answer to the question Mr Mulder asked, if the European Development Fund were budgetised, as Parliament and I are asking, budget support - for example the amount, technique, controls, verification and monitoring - would be done automatically, which would greatly simplify the procedure."
"You cannot imagine how much easier and more efficient my life would be if I depended much more directly on Parliament's choices, options and control over the use of my budget."
"As things stand, I am afraid that this will unfortunately not be possible, but clearly this is a subject I would like to discuss."
"The question you ask proves once again that the budgetisation of the European Development Fund would be a considerable advance on the level of effectiveness of our support."
"I contribute to this debate with a degree of sadness."
"Five years ago in December 2002 I was part of the European Parliament's Election Observation Mission to Kenya led by Baroness Nicholson."
"That election was conducted within International Guidelines that gave the result an integrity that validated a result that gave a victory to the opposition."
"Having had the opportunity to meet with Mwai Kibaki, the incoming President, we all felt, alongside the conviction of the fairness of his election, that Kenya's future looked brighter with a new era of more efficiency and less corruption beckoning."
"Now like at the end of George Orwell's 'Animal Farm' the pigs have become men and the men pigs."
"The regime that offered so much promise has become as corrupt and inept as its predecessor, in the process destroying the hopes and future of millions of Kenyans."
"I welcome the robust statements of the EU's Chief Election Observer."
"I hope the Commission will encourage reconciliation amongst the disputing factions and threaten strong measures if there is any failure to agree."
"in writing. - As a former European Parliament election observer for Kenya, I am deeply concerned by the turn of events following the election in December."
"The fact that Kenya has for years been seen as the most stable country in that part of the African continent makes developments doubly worrying."
"Kenya, like my country, is a member of the Commonwealth."
"I support the proposal put forward by the Commonwealth observation team that independent Commonwealth judges be put in place to review the election results."
"Our own EU election observation team suggested that an independent audit of the results take place."
"I am convinced that the Kenyan people would have confidence in such an audit being carried out by Commonwealth judges."
"Our immediate priority is to see Kenya return to a state of normality, by which I mean a peaceful society in which the democratic process is not in doubt."
"The news today that the security forces prevented opposition politicians from staging a protest rally does not bode well."
"I urge the EU to do all in its power to work with other international organisations to ensure that Kenya can recover both its normality and its democracy."
"EUROPOL (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council decision establishing the European Police Office (EUROPOL) - C6-0055/2007 -."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I would first like to thank Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra for the report he prepared regarding the Council's decision in favour of establishing the European Police Bureau, Europol, on the basis of the proposal put forward by the Commission."
"At this point in time, the Council is still debating the draft of said decision and, in these debates, the Presidency will refer to or take into consideration the above-mentioned report by the Member of Parliament."
"Especially in the area of personal data protection and democratic control, the Presidency will take into consideration or strive to take into consideration doubts expressed by the rapporteur."
"The shaping, final shaping, of the Council's decision by June 2008 is one of the priority tasks of our Presidency."
"The aim of the decision, which will replace the Europol Convention, is primarily to improve the operative and administrative function of Europol, thereby enabling it to respond more rapidly and more effectively to new challenges."
"I must emphasise that the German and Portuguese Presidencies have already achieved an important advance in this matter, on the basis of which sections one, two, three, six, seven and nine have been finally shaped."
"These are the sections on foundation and tasks, data processing systems, common information processing provisions, organisation, confidentiality matters and other provisions."
"Therefore, the Presidency will from now on concentrate primarily on the remaining sections regarding relations with partners, security and data security, budgetary provisions, i.e. monitoring and evaluation, and transitional and final provisions."
"In deliberations on the open sections, pursuant to the Council decisions of June last year, the Presidency will devote special considerations to finding appropriate solutions for the following issues: firstly the issues of removing immunity from Europol officials working for common investigation units; secondly the principle of rotation and the possibility for those employed by Europol and participating in common investigation units to receive instructions from the head of the unit; and thirdly the question of budgetary neutrality."
"The expert groups have already started deliberations on the issues mentioned, and the Europol working group and the committee are also continuing deliberations according to article 36."
"The two key elements of all these deliberations will be the improvement of Europol's operational capacity and the consideration of the principle of budgetary neutrality."
"The Presidency is aiming to reach an agreement on these questions as early as the first quarter of 2008."
"The Presidency will also closely follow the course of events relating to the implementation plan."
"This plan defines all the key points which should be resolved if the decision on Europol is to be enforced from 1 January 2010."
"The initial debates on all such implementation measures are scheduled to start in the first half of this year."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Slovenian Presidency, whom I thank, has just said that the Commission's proposal, of December 2006, which aims to replace the Europol Convention with a Council decision, is one of their priorities, and that they hope to secure political agreement as soon as possible."
"Obviously I offer them my full support because I believe the operation and administrative functioning of Europol will be clearly improved by it and that, as the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers pointed out in June, the ability to operate effectively is a key aim of the reform of Europol."
"I also thank most warmly the rapporteur, Mr Díaz de Mera, for the quality of his report and I would highlight the quality of the amendments proposed on the basis of his proposal, which has, however, been subject since then to many modifications, mentioned by the Presidency, following discussions during the German and Portuguese Presidencies."
"The Commission is going to look at how these amendments can be taken into account."
"Among the amendments, the Commission notes the proposal from Mr Díaz de Mera that Parliament's democratic scrutiny of Europol could operate by Europol being funded from the general budget of the European Union."
"I also support the idea of Community funding referred to in Amendment 6, which relates to Recital 5."
"I also support Europol having a Community footing, requested in Amendment 5."
"Generally speaking, I am very interested in the amendments tabled on the role of the data protection officer, such as Amendment 9, and those concerning data protection."
"There are many, but I would particularly like to mention Amendments 13, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24 and 25, and can agree with the objective."
"On the role of Europol officials in the coordination of joint investigation teams, I would point out that this coordination role was not supported by the Council."
"It was discussed at length, and in view of legislation that now applies to joint investigation teams, the Member States can still, in the arrangements they make between participating Member States, set up a joint investigation team, and specify and limit the role of Europol officials."
"Therefore, on this point, we need to continue discussions to reach a good compromise."
"Consequently, at this stage, making a provision of this kind in the proposal for a decision on Europol would unfortunately not be sufficient to grant a wider investigation coordination role to Europol officials, legally and systematically - a role, ladies and gentlemen, that I would personally like, of course."
"I agree with Amendment 15, which proposes establishing a special relationship between the national unit and the competent national authorities."
"These, then, are the comments I wanted to make on this report, and I thank the rapporteur once again."
"I hope that the vote by Parliament can take place this week, so we can all give Europol excellent prospects for the near future and the possibility of a new status very soon that will enable it to function better."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, I would also like to thank you for your words and for your support."
"I would like to start by asking for a commitment from the Council to this House for the decision that we are debating to be reviewed by the European Parliament no more than six months after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"As an MEP I strongly defend the broadening of Parliament's powers, especially those which, in the foreseeable future, will give this House the essential capacity as joint legislator in such important matters as are those concerning the area of freedom, security and justice."
"However, I also believe that Parliament cannot make its work dependent on the anticipated entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, or suspend it on this basis."
"Our work therefore needs to continue."
"We need to continue with the process that is underway and use it in two ways: to be more effective in the fight against crime and to decisively claim the powers of the European Parliament."
"Crime is dynamic and is constantly changing, therefore Europol and the other EU instruments to protect the safety of its citizens need to adapt more quickly to the changing times."
"The Convention of July 1995 is obsolete, so it is crucial for the Europol Decision, with its numerous advances, to enter into force quickly in order to provide better protection for EU citizens."
"Keeping the system of protocols for amending the Convention is an absolutely anachronistic process."
"The new proposal that I am putting forward for debate introduces substantial changes."
"Firstly, by means of a Council decision based on Article 34(2) of the EU Treaty, it puts forward a much more flexible instrument."
"Secondly, the proposal puts forward significant fundamental changes such as converting the Office into a European agency, which will mean giving its staff the status of EU officials and financing it from the Community budget, which is desirable."
"Another significant change is the extension of the scope of Europol's power to cover non-organised crime."
"The independent Data Protection Officer is another important step forward in terms of monitoring and guarantees."
"The work done by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has fulfilled two objectives."
"First amending the Council's proposal in order to give Europol a specific framework for the protection of personal data and, with this in mind, I would like to highlight the need for the Council to adopt the proposal for a framework decision on this as soon as possible."
"Secondly, giving Parliament greater control over Europol's activities; in order to do this, we have proposed creating of an ad hoc committee made up of members of this House and of national parliaments, involving the European Parliament in the process of appointing and dismissing the Director, as well as other measures aimed at ensuring budgetary control over the new agency and its programme of work."
"I sincerely believe that the proposals adopted in our parliamentary committee improve the Council's original document, which otherwise makes a great deal of changes."
"This is why, President-in-Office of the Council, I ask for your support for our report."
"I would like to finish with sincere thanks to my colleagues from all the political groups for their valuable contributions, and, in particular, I would like to mention the negotiating efforts of Mr Moraes, Mr Alvaro and Mr Fava, and the contributions of Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Catania."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (DE) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Committee on Budgets is positive about the Commission's proposal to lead Europol out of its interstate position and into communitisation."
"If Europol is therefore soon to be funded entirely from the European budget, Parliament's budgetary rights must also be protected by the structures."
"The Committee responsible has kindly adopted all our respective amendments."
"I also hope that the list that Commissioner Frattini has just read out is not exclusive, because I noticed that a number of amendments were not included."
"We have all, however, got it straight that part of the administration would again be financed by operational resources."
"We now call upon the Council to sit down at the table with us immediately and come to a mutual agreement on the financing of Europol, because one thing is certain: everything we decide tomorrow applies only under the proviso of the result of the Council negotiations in accordance with Article 47 of the interinstitutional agreement of May 2006."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats I expressly support the proposal that the Council has put forward for integrating Europol into the framework of the European institutions, on several grounds."
"Firstly, because we will have a new legal foundation, which will save us lengthy ratification procedures and therefore make it possible for Europol to adapt quickly and flexibly to new situations, and secondly, because not only will the protocols be adopted, but jurisdiction will be extended to encompass preparatory data and data on procurement of funds, because the operating appropriations are being increased, because the funding comes from the EU budget and therefore greater independence is established for Europol as well and better monitoring opportunities are provided for us as Parliament and last but not least, because in future, data protection will also continue to be safeguarded at a very high level."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very realistic amendments, particularly as regards the tasks of the mixed committee, the immunity of Europol employees in their operational commitments, the role of Parliament in appointing the Director and also particularly as regards data protection."
"He has done an excellent job here on Parliament's behalf."
"If all these proposals are accepted, Europol will become more effective, more flexible and more manageable."
"I have no sympathy for the Liberals' proposal to postpone all these measures to strengthen Europol to provide more security in the interest of citizens until the Treaty comes into force."
"We need security now, which means we need Europol now."
"We have to do the work now and then we shall certainly deal with the subject once again - should it be necessary - after the Treaty has come into force."
"I would therefore ask the Liberals to reconsider their proposal and if possible withdraw the amendment."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist group welcomes the adoption of the Europol report and the proposal to convert Europol into an EU agency."
"After an extremely long period of waiting we are finally in a position to make Europol into a concrete and effective tool in combating organised crime, as well as many other dangerous types of crime which are now manifesting themselves at European level - I am thinking, for instance, of the action that Europol will be able to take on money-laundering."
"Our group wanted to strengthen the supervisory powers specified in the proposal into genuine parliamentary supervision, not just restricted to budgetary powers, of course, and we wanted to strengthen the provisions on personal data protection and data security, particularly in the absence of a good framework decision on data protection in the third pillar, which is still taking its time in coming."
"We cannot, however, ignore the fact, as pointed out by Mr Díaz de Mera García, that meanwhile the context has changed: the signing of the Lisbon Treaty creates the prospect that in the near future police cooperation will be subject to co-decision by the European Parliament and thus to our full responsibility, to qualified majority voting in Council and to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice."
"This is why we are asking the Slovenian Presidency for a formal undertaking to put a review of the dossier before the European Parliament within six months of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Finally, the Socialist group still believes that it would have been more appropriate, on a matter as sensitive as this, for the rapporteur to have withdrawn to a certain degree, in view of the events that saw him involved in politics in his country."
"Our group has, however, decided not to leave out his contribution to a dossier that we believe to be of strategic importance for the process of European integration."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Mr Vice-President, Minister, before I begin I should like to thank Mr°Díaz de Mera García Consuegra for his constructive and outstanding cooperation."
"Our teamwork, including with colleagues from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, has been very good despite, incidentally, the isolated case where the Socialists criticised the rapporteur."
"We have no misgivings at all about the expansion of Europol, which was founded in 1994 as the European Drug Unit and was converted into Europol, as we now know it, in 1999."
"This is necessary to protect our population in the fight against organised crime, which does not stop at borders, whether these be sea, land or air."
"In the same way, Europe's officials must be able to take action and deal with it."
"It must be equally clear, however, that there are certain ground rules in police work."
"Immunity of Europol officers, as is regulated in the codicil, does not make sense."
"This has to be said."
"It does not make sense that Europe's police officers should have more powers as Europol officers than others do."
"Nor does it make sense that there are no parliamentary controls over police cooperation."
"After all, we want to create an efficient authority, which can also be called to account for any mistakes it may make, and not the Sheriff of Nottingham!"
"The same applies to the judicial scrutiny of Europol."
"It is inconceivable that a police authority in Europe should be able to act without its actions being subject to judicial review."
"As a result we Liberals (our colleague Mr Pirker has perhaps misunderstood this) have introduced an amendment, whereby a revision clause is to be adopted, as Mr Fava has already stated, so that the European Parliament is able to deal with this once again six months after the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force."
"As for the rest, we - that is the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, at least - also expect a clear statement from the Council here that this revision clause is being considered and included in the negotiations."
"In the face of a structural majority, we would not wish to make use of Article 53 or Article 168 of the Rules of procedure, that is, referral to the Committee, because we, too, believe that we need Europol now and that its expansion should not be delayed."
"However, when forced to, we must act in this way."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, I should like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, on his report."
"As we know, we are living in a Union in which citizens can travel freely, but coordination at EU level in the sphere of justice and home affairs nevertheless needs to play a more central role."
"Organised crime is tending to become more internationalised, and the onus is thus on the EU to enable Europol to assume an active role in halting the illegal flow of drugs from non-EU countries."
"Europol must endeavour to stamp out the illicit trafficking whereby many people are being smuggled into the EU - more often than not against their will - to work in the sex industry, for example."
"Ireland will soon be holding a referendum on the European Treaty, and I should like to place it on record that we shall continue in the future to play our full part in the European justice and home affairs sphere - just as we have done up to now."
"And that we shall not exercise the option of saying no unless a problem arises as regards domestic legislation."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, sincerely for his work."
"He had already produced a really good piece of work, and was then very constructive in the way he dealt with the amendments tabled by Members."
"My group can therefore endorse his report."
"I would like to make it clear to the Council, however, that support for the Díaz de Mera García Consuegra report is not synonymous with support for the Council decision, because there are still some differences between the two, particularly regarding data protection."
"The report rules out the unrestrained use of databases, as data may only be used for specific purposes, must be subject to judicial control in the Member States, and may only be processed on a case-by-case basis."
"My question is whether the Council would like to respond to those amendments."
"Commissioner Frattini has just set a good example by going into the specifics of the report, enabling us to see exactly what the Commission stands for."
"I thank him sincerely for this."
"I now hope that the President-in-Office can make it clear what the Council thinks of the European Parliament's additions."
"Not everyone in my group is a staunch supporter of a strong police force, but any improvement in judicial and democratic control can count on our strong support."
"Therefore, we support the conversion of Europol into an agency, with the associated increase in budgetary control."
"We are also in favour of greater judicial control; and so I consider the proposal of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe to be extremely sensible, and shall give it my support."
"As Mr Alvaro has just said, admittedly rather cautiously, we can have another look at this in six months' time."
"As far as I am concerned, we shall not only look at the proposal, but also modify it."
"My question to the Council is this: do you plan to accept this proposal?"
"If so, what difference do you believe it will make as regards control by the Court of Justice, including over Europol?"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I also think that we need to have a transnational police force that can specifically tackle international crime, which today is no longer confined within national borders."
"Only a few days ago the Italian Parliament's anti-Mafia commission went to Germany, where it found that an enormous amount of the financial resources invested in Germany have been obtained through a mechanism that directly involves Sicilian and Calabrian criminals."
"I believe that this is emblematic of the real need to combat crime on an international basis, and one way to do so is by putting in place European police resources."
"I believe that Europol can accomplish this job, but I have some doubts about whether transforming Europol into an agency can immediately salvage it."
"We have a duty to evaluate Europol's activities from 1994 to today, and I believe that we will probably also need to review its specific mission, because I think that its priorities ought to be tackling drug trafficking, money-laundering and transnational Mafia organisations."
"I believe that there are also still some problems regarding the need to fully recognise Parliament's powers."
"Parliament should have supervisory powers - this is the case for all national parliaments, which have supervisory powers over the national police - and I believe that the European Parliament should have supervisory powers over a European agency whose key tasks are policing and combating international crime."
"I also believe that we need to have some clarifications on data protection."
"I am extremely worried because the proposal, as it has been adopted and probably will be adopted in the future by the Council, has serious deficiencies which put the individual data of European citizens at serious risk."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, the rapporteur was, I understand, the Director-General of Spain's police between 2002 and 2004."
"This means, I assume, that one of his last tasks before leaving office was to deal with the immediate aftermath of the terrible bombings in Madrid."
"I, therefore, accept the sincerity with which he now puts the case for extending the powers of EUROPOL in order to deal with new terrorist threats."
"However, I will not need to remind him that my country, too, has had a long history of facing up to terrorism and, like his country, that consisted for many years of a threat from separatists, which, in recent years, has been matched by the new threat of Islamic extremism."
"What I am saying is that my country is very grateful for help and cooperation from its neighbours where necessary, but, in the final analysis, it must be able to act exactly according to its own methods and procedures and on its own initiative."
"But what is being proposed here is not just a further encroachment of EUROPOL into areas that should be left under the control of Member States."
"Worse still than that, the Commission wants to change the legal framework governing EUROPOL so that any extension of EUROPOL's powers does not have to be ratified by Member States."
"The rapporteur concludes his statement by saying that we must ensure EUROPOL enjoys maximum democratic legitimacy."
"Once again, we see that the EU, as it seeks to take powers from Member States, even in matters of policing, has a very strange idea of democratic legitimacy."
"Madam President, whatever the desirability of combating terrorism and organised crime - and it is desirable - it is clear to me that this expansion of the role for EUROPOL and the change in its legal basis and title are about something quite different."
"They are, in fact, about giving the apparatus of statehood to the EU."
"States naturally and properly have police forces."
"Now the EU is to have its own right to have European police officers, funded from the EU budget and staffed by EU officials."
"In truth and in fact, they will be EU policemen doing the bidding of the EU and roaming across Europe, meddling in the work of national police forces, particularly since their competence to initiate and lead inquiries is to be extended beyond organised crime into ever increasing areas of criminal law."
"Then, to crown what for me is that absurdity, these EU policemen are to have immunity from national constraints and their actions put beyond the reach of judicial review."
"That causes me to reject these proposals."
"They are but the latest manifestation of super statehood for the EU - all under the framework of the Constitution and none of it with the consent of the peoples of Europe because of the conspiracy amongst EU leaders to subvert democracy and refuse referendums."
"(PT) Vice-President Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, in 1998 the European Parliament rejected all the initiatives presented to it when consulted on matters of detail relating to Europol."
"It did so out of consistency as long as Europol continued, in the intergovernmental context, without being subject to democratic and jurisdictional control."
"Now this initiative has come in response to what we have constantly been requesting in this plenary, with the aim of converting Europol into an EU agency, financed from the Community budget, and strengthening our role of democratic control."
"Despite this proposal being a subject of deep controversy in Council, I think that we should not accept any further postponement."
"The European Parliament has an obligation to show its support for the Commission's initiative to make Europol an EU agency."
"Europol's current legal framework, an international convention, moreover impedes any process of updating or modifying powers, with delays of years."
"Indeed, the increase of new threats to security, such as terrorism, which poses new challenges to Europol, requires a new approach."
"Hence the importance of this decision, which should not only place Europol on an equal footing with Eurojust and the European Police College but also make it more efficient in operation, extending its mandate to crimes that are not strictly related to organised crime and introducing greater flexibility into its mechanisms."
"At the same time greater transparency and democratic and jurisdictional control must be guaranteed."
"I therefore support the excellent report that Mr Díaz de Mera has produced, and the important amendments he tabled, notably regarding data protection."
"I would like to pay tribute to Mr Díaz de Mera and express my solidarity for the excellent report he has produced and for the person that he is, especially as some Members tried unfairly to diminish his work, raising national struggles that have furthermore already had a full response from the Spanish Supreme Court of Justice."
"- (PL) The main task that the European Police Office faces is that of improving efficiency of action and cooperation between the authorities in Member States as regards preventing and combating international organised crime."
"The agency's mission is to make a contribution to the sphere of law enforcement in the European Union with reference to this form of crime."
"This is becoming increasingly important in the face of the new forms of crime which are constantly appearing and the threat of terrorism."
"Life is forcing us to expand Europol's powers and also to adapt the principles on which it functions through the introduction of more flexible mechanisms."
"With the agency proposed by the rapporteur, however, there is an urgent need for the introduction of clear principles for the democratic monitoring of Europol and personal data protection."
"- (EL) Madam President, in its proposal for the establishment of a European police force, the Commission is seeking to transform Europol from a body based on inter-state agreement into an institutional body of the European Union."
"This, in my view, shows how wide ranging Europol's enforcement operations are and is proof of the overall strengthening of the European Union's enforcement framework and mechanisms."
"Two things grow quickly in the European Union: the profits of companies and of capital, and aggressive enforcement mechanisms."
"We have filled all our respective countries with police forces and enforcement mechanisms and now this is happening at EU level too."
"This development also expands Europol's field of activity and includes all punishable acts in its sphere of competence."
"It acquires the right to intervene even in the Member States themselves in relation to international events of major significance with consequences for public order, such as international demonstrations."
"Alongside the vast SIS II and VIS monitoring systems etc., the Europol information system will be used to file personal data relating to workers throughout the European Union as well as data relating to political, trade union and social activities and personal convictions. This data will be exchanged not only between the security services and secret services of the EU Member States, but also with private individuals, such as independent assassins operating in Iraq."
"The claims that the transformation of Europol is purportedly a democratic development are self-deceiving or at best naïve."
"Why?"
"Because there is no real possibility of controlling the inaccessible citadel of Europol or of restricting its enforcement activities."
"Furthermore, many people have commented on the immunity of Europol police offers and the inadequacy of any national control."
"For these reasons we are firmly opposed to the proposal."
"(SV) Madam President, we have created a single market with free movement of goods, services, capital and people."
"Almost everyone has agreed to participate in Schengen."
"In practice all border controls in the EU have been abolished."
"From a liberal point of view, this is a gigantic step forward."
"We no longer need to stand with cap in hand in front of officials when we want to study, work, travel or seek health care in another EU country."
"However, freedom has its downside."
"When border controls disappeared, the scope for organised crime increased enormously."
"This eased the way for the drugs trade, the exchange of stolen goods and trafficking."
"Sometimes this expansion in organised crime is used as proof that the EU is needed."
"That is grotesque."
"The expansion is facilitated by the EU, a price we are obliged to pay for increased freedom and prosperity."
"How high is that price?"
"Well, police resources have to be increased perhaps by 1-2% of GDP at national level in order to roll back this phenomenon."
"Such an increase in national resources is the most important and perhaps the only way to restore an honest, decent Europe."
"The rapporteur wants to transfer power over the police to Brussels."
"Europol should become an EU body financed from the EU budget."
"He makes light of questions of integrity and democratic legitimacy."
"We must therefore say no to this report, focus on the expansion of national police resources and let Europol remain a cooperation body subject to intergovernmental procedures."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this report proposes nothing more and nothing less than to give the European Police Office, Europol, a new status by modifying its existing legal bases."
"Indeed, the intention is to replace the Europol Convention concluded in 1995 between the Member States with a Council decision converting the agency from an intergovernmental body into a European Union agency financed from the Community budget and applying the Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities."
"The reasons given for this radical change of status are the extension of the mandate of Europol's activities beyond just organised crime and the Member States' inability to meet these new and very extensive objectives adequately."
"These objectives will obviously be better met at European Union level, the Council assures us."
"But this is all smoke and mirrors."
"The reality is that we are already engaged with the requirements and application of the Treaty of Lisbon, which transfers almost all of justice and home affairs policy to a qualified majority of the Council of Ministers."
"Until now, these fields of judicial and police cooperation have required unanimity."
"The reality is that our national and European leaders are in the process of imposing on us institutional reforms that all work towards a more deeply supranational and bureaucratic model."
"It is these same reforms that are in the Treaty of Lisbon that were rejected by the French and Dutch in the referendums of May and June 2005."
"The people have been duped, misled and treated with contempt."
"Europe cannot be built contrary to its people and contrary to national realities, and it is high time that our pro-European political class realised this and finally left Europe to construct itself from the nations' and people's rights to identity, sovereignty, freedom and security."
"- (EL) Madam President, as a member of the Committee on Budgets and also as an MEP who comes from a region on the European Union's external borders, I would like to make three observations:"
"Firstly, turning Europol into a Community agency requires that we receive more value for money from its work."
"We want this Community Europol to have a greater presence in places where we need it - in the Balkans, combating the organised mafia - and not in staffrooms or offices."
"Secondly, within the Community Europol framework, the national police forces must gradually overcome their distrust of each other."
"The Member States' police authorities must learn to cooperate above and beyond borders and national priorities."
"The transformation of Europol into a Community agency allows for this."
"Thirdly and most importantly, we have devoted much time to the institutional dimension of this file."
"I wish to offer my full support to the rapporteur, Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, who chose a practical and realistic solution."
"We cannot paralyse the entire procedure until 2009 while we wait for the perfect institutional solution, nor can we carry on theological debates when issues are pressing."
"The time for action is now, and now we must act."
"It is within this context, then, that I express my full support for the approach mapped out by the rapporteur, and I hope that this debate will be the first stage in the formation of a genuine European Community police service capable of dealing with problems."
"- (EL) Madam President, once again we must salute the development of this large police body known as Europol."
"We have been doing so since 1992."
"The records of its performance have not been bad."
"I have the impression that the new form which we are attempting to give it will create problems, bearing in mind that the British police will be operating in Paris and Greek police officers in Berlin."
"We will see how to get around this, but there is always the problem of distrust between police authorities."
"I salute Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra's very careful work."
"If we need to restrict Europol's activities to terrorism issues, then among other crimes it must try to find real terrorism, rather than develop a mechanism which, instead of hunting down terrorism, hangs like a noose, stifling the human and political rights of European citizens."
"(CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that the change in the legal standing of Europol, which we are now discussing, is not a step in the right direction."
"Europol is functioning well at present and does not need any changes to its status."
"Police work is the domain of the Member States and the main responsibility for the work therefore rests, logically and rightly, with the national governments, which are controlled by the national parliaments."
"This approach is already implicitly respected even in Schengen cooperation, in which the Czech Republic has been fully involved since the end of last year."
"Police cooperation at EU level is therefore, logically, subject to an inter-governmental approach."
"The Commission now wishes to abandon this correct and logical approach and, in fact, re-shape Europol into a new agency that is subordinate to the European institutions."
"However, an agency format is not suitable for Europol and will not bring any benefits."
"The national interior ministers will have less and less control of Europol there will be no advantages in terms of the fight against crime."
"In my opinion, to start with there should be proper and democratic ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, which also has a bearing on Europol's legal basis: only after that can negotiations begin on a possible amendment of the legal basis."
"For this reason I will be voting against this report."
"Madam President, just to show that the PPE-DE Group has a lot of diversity, I completely disagree with the previous speaker and would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on an excellent report."
"I think this report is very good and I think it is good for three reasons."
"The first reason is that it expands the powers of EUROPOL."
"It brings it into the Community budget, it creates an agency, and it extends its mandate beyond organised crime."
"I think that is a very important step forward."
"The second reason I think it is good is because it calls for more flexibility."
"You do not have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out that, if an organisation is established in 1995 and its conventions are amended three times from 2000 to 2003 and those changes enter into force only in the year 2007, the organisation is not working."
"It is not flexible enough."
"We need more flexibility and I think that is what this report proposes."
"There is nothing more conservative in this world than an interior ministry or a police establishment and I think we have seen it with EUROPOL."
"The third point is: I think that this is a good report because it increases supranational and communautaire elements and it decreases intergovernmental elements."
"It increases judicial scrutiny and democracy - and if there is one area where you have to work together, it is this."
"The more free movement you have, the more Schengen you have, the more international crime you have, the more we need cooperation on a European level and I think this report is a good step in that direction."
"(ES) Madam President, a small clarification."
"As our Socialist coordinator said, we Socialists still think that the rapporteur is not the most suitable person to produce reports on judicial and police cooperation."
"It is true, as Mr Coelho said, that the Supreme Court has closed the case, but it is a question of ethics and political dignity."
"I will explain: I should make it clear that the rapporteur refused to cooperate with the Spanish legal system and was fined for it."
"This was not a trivial matter: it was the trial of the terrorists accused of the worst attack that has been perpetrated in the European Union."
"We therefore think that, for the sake of consistency, a person cannot refuse to cooperate with the legal system in Spain and then lecture Europe on how the Member States should cooperate with each other in police and judicial matters."
"Madam President, what we have heard in this debate is the usual confusion between cooperation and integration."
"I very much support those who have expressed concern at the EU efforts to expand EUROPOL's powers and competence."
"Of course we need good cooperation between police and security services."
"I happen to believe that we have always had that good cooperation at the operational level, but it can always be improved."
"Indeed, in my experience at EUROPOL - and I am probably one of the few Members of this House who has been to EUROPOL on a number of occasions - most of its activity is bilateral, which gives the lie to this idea that it has some other great role."
"The need for cooperation is very different to the involvement of the European Union institutions, which is merely part of the EU's wider agenda of political integration."
"Madam President, I wanted to add my voice to that of my colleague, Geoffrey Van Orden, and my previous colleague from the Czech Republic, from the ODS."
"I disagree with Mr Stubb."
"I am also nervous - and I do not think it would be supported by many of my constituents in the United Kingdom - about the idea of turning EUROPOL into a kind of supranational fledging European Union FBI-style organisation."
"Like all colleagues, I am, of course, in favour of intergovernmental cooperation in police, intelligence and security matters, particularly when we face growing problems from international organised crime, international terrorism etc. EUROPOL already has quite an extensive remit in areas like people trafficking as well, but we do not need to extend the powers of EUROPOL."
"It should be an agency charged with acting as a gatekeeper in terms of exchange of information and also building up more confidence between our national police forces and our security and intelligence services."
"There is a lot of mistrust between some of the Member States' traditional law enforcement agencies."
"Europol should be acting as a kind of coordinator and not be given special rights."
"I would particularly object to any idea of EU policemen being able to go into our own Member States with powers of arrest."
"Madam President, I cannot resist the temptation of answering my two colleagues Mr Van Orden and Mr Tannock."
"We are not trying to create some kind of a US FBI type of organisation here, we are simply trying to have police cooperation which works better, which is more effective, which is more transparent, which is more flexible and which simply works."
"That is what we do not have today, that is what we are trying to do."
"I do not want to get into the internal UK debate and scaremongering, that we are creating some kind of FBI with some kind of superpowers, with European police coming into your house to arrest you."
"That is not what we are trying to do."
"We are trying to get the third pillar cooperation of police to work better."
"That is all."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Allow me just a comment or two on this extremely interesting debate, which I am honoured to attend."
"My first comment relates to the Council's attitude towards amendments, of which there are many, although I cannot represent the Council's opinion here just yet."
"As was said in the introduction, the Council is still deliberating on this decision and it will resume deliberation within this framework after the amendments."
"However, I can maintain that as the Presidency we will strive for a detailed and mindful debate of all the amendments to be approved."
"We will also strive for the greatest possible number to be included in the text of the decision."
"I cannot guarantee more that this."
"As we know, approval of a decision at this moment in time still requires the consensus of all the Member States."
"This leads me to the following comment regarding the revision clause."
"There is no Council opinion on this either, but I think that, in the name of the Council, I can express a certain doubt about building into the text of an act such as this mechanisms which should automatically be activated in the period after the Treaty of Lisbon comes into effect."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has not yet come into force."
"Its enforcement is in the hands of the national parliaments and in at least one case in the hands of the voters."
"It is my opinion that by building such a mechanism into acts of this kind, we will not facilitate the approval of acts such as this; what is more, we will not facilitate ratification procedures that are currently taking place."
"I also think that this question received a satisfactory solution in declaration No. 50 attached to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"- (DE) Madam President, because I had the feeling that the Minister had misunderstood this, I just wanted to take the liberty very briefly of pointing out the fact that the revision clause does not in any way jeopardise or influence ratification of the Treaty, but simply guarantees that after ratification, Parliament will once again deal with the Europol report."
"After consultation with other permanent representatives, it does not seem to me that this threat is seen as general."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for all the contributions that have been made."
"I will be very brief."
"Firstly I will give a general reply to all those who have expressed doubts about the need to strengthen Europol, those who have spoken about the will of the people and the concerns of citizens."
"I would like to say that if there is one subject on which the vast majority of European citizens expresses fear regarding the free movement of criminals and asks for more security, it is this very subject of police cooperation."
"If there is one subject on which the more is said, as Mr Stubb noted, the more the movement of persons is liberalised, the more need there is for European coordination and action on transnational crime and thus the concept of a European agency is certainly not that of a bureaucratic body, but of a fast, effective operational tool."
"This is why I am convinced - and this is not only because I put forward the proposal - of the need to adopt this decision speedily, as the Slovenian Presidency wishes."
"Regarding the amendments, I have already mentioned the amendment tabled by Mr Alvaro."
"I would like to remind you that the idea of having a regular review of the smooth operation of current 'third pillar' initiatives is something permitted by Declaration No 50, which has just been mentioned."
"What does this say?"
"It says that the Commission, on a case-by-case basis, when the situation is appropriate, following entry into force of the Treaty, shall propose the review of instruments currently falling within the third pillar in order to change them into instruments over which Parliament has full co-decision powers and to which the procedures which Parliament in my view rightly wishes for apply."
"Thus the instrument already exists for this purpose."
"It is perhaps the imposition of such a restricted time frame to this instrument that poses some problems for me personally, but I also wonder, and I have no preconceptions on this point: is it advisable to plan a review of an instrument such as the Europol decision, which has not yet entered into force?"
"I ask the question because you know that if we were to adopt this decision before the end of the Slovenian Presidency - in June 2008 - it would enter into force in January 2010."
"So can we already plan to undertake to review an instrument when its operation will begin in January 2010?"
"I would not be opposed to arguing, when it is in operation, if problems emerge that are linked to insufficient democratic monitoring, that that would be an excellent reason for the European Commission to apply Declaration No 50 and change the instrument from the third pillar to the new system."
"One of my reasons for giving this example is to say that we cannot close the door on Parliament's need for democratic monitoring, but it is perhaps the manner and time frames of this strict compulsory review procedure that pose problems for us."
"Madam President, before you start counting the time, I would like to ask you to take the following into consideration: please give me the two minutes that I am entitled to so that I can respond out of courtesy to all of my colleagues, the Council and the Commission, but also, Madam President, I earnestly ask you to give me some separate time to answer the very serious, unjustified allusions that have been made about me."
"May I count on your understanding, Madam President? Thank you very much."
"I am very grateful to almost all my colleagues - and I emphasise the word 'almost' - for their contributions, and I very especially take them on board."
"I would like to say that the concerns that have been expressed here are not only the concerns of the rapporteur, but that they are also the concerns of the House."
"It has been very gratifying for me to hear how well disposed the Council is and the wise words of compromise and also clarification from Vice-President Frattini."
"I would therefore like to thank all my fellow Members, those who have honoured me with their support as well as those who have honoured me with their criticisms."
"You should not forget that I have been a Member of Parliament for seventeen years, and still am, and I was the Director-General of Police for the Kingdom of Spain for two years."
"I was."
"That is how I am able to see both sides of the coin."
"President-in-Office of the Council, I would therefore like once again to highlight the issues that concern us: we cannot fight crime on our own."
"Crime is transnational."
"Crime goes beyond borders, and our police forces, which are national, need to have in Europol an instrument to support and strengthen them."
"Not one that interferes or overlaps with their work, but one that supports and strengthens them."
"Guarantees are very important to us."
"It is very important to us to support and strengthen Europol, but with three criteria: confidence, control and guarantees."
"This is naturally what has been made clear in our report and in the contributions of fellow members."
"Data protection in the Framework Decision in the third pillar as soon as possible is important to us."
"It is extremely important to us that Parliament has control and it is very important to us to decisively and determinedly fight organised crime together."
"Now, Madam President, due to the allusions, I would like to answer the second, much more unpleasant, question."
"Mr Moreno does not respect judicial decisions."
"The Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Spain and the Public Prosecutor at the Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Spain said these exact words in reference to my case. I do not know if they translate well, but they said these exact words, 'no crime whatsoever'."
"However, some people, such as Mr Moreno, have not had and do not have the intellectual and moral integrity to apologise for spreading something that they should not have spread."
"What Mr Moreno has done here is to intoxicate Parliament comme d'habitude with issues that do not have anything to do with the report or with the heart of the matter."
"He talks about morality and lack of dignity."
"It is immoral and undignified not to respect judicial decisions and, on top of that, to throw them back in the face of a colleague who does have dignity and morality."
"I will not say that Mr Moreno is undignified and immoral, but what I will say is that he has behaved in an undignified and immoral way."
"What I will say in his defence is that I would like to think that they are not his own ideas, but that he has behaved, not like a messenger boy, but rather that this time he has had the brazenness to act as the messenger boy."
"Why?"
"In order to unjustifiably discredit and perhaps in the vain attempt to get a few column inches in the Spanish press."
"(FR) The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 17 January 2008."
"Situation in Pakistan following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto (debate)"
"(FR) The next item is the Council and the Commission statements on the situation in Pakistan following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) The assassination of the former Prime Minister and main opposition leader, Benazir Bhutto, aggravated the already complicated situation prior to the elections in Pakistan."
"In addition, it had a negative effect on the process of gradual transition to a more democratic system in Pakistan."
"Benazir Bhutto was certainly one of those who could have contributed to progress in areas of economic development, reduced corruption and more freedom for the media."
"Ever since the introduction of a state of emergency on 3 November last year, The European Union and the European Parliament have emphasised the need for stability and appealed for reconciliation and the reintroduction of democracy."
"Stability in Pakistan is certainly in our strategic interest."
"That means that we are supporting the struggle of the moderate majority of Pakistanis against the violent minority of extremists."
"Our interests - the interests of the European Union in Pakistan - are also closely associated with our priority tasks in Afghanistan and the wider region."
"They are associated with our fight against terrorism and against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and with our fight for the respect of human rights, and all this was emphasised many times in our messages to the Pakistani authorities."
"President Musharraf will probably come to Brussels next week."
"That will be a unique opportunity to pass on our message."
"Together with our international partners we have also established contacts with other major parties in Pakistan."
"The key message of the Council of the European Union is that to conduct free and honest elections open to all in Pakistan next month is of crucial importance."
"The Pakistani government must strive to provide appropriate political and security conditions for carrying out such elections."
"In addition, all the parties must accept the decision of the Electoral Commission that the election of 18 February should be carried out with dignity and restraint."
"We are also inviting the Pakistani authorities to use the extended period up to the elections to improve the conditions for the elections in accordance with international standards."
"Primarily, the authorities must guarantee to do everything in their power to prevent electoral fraud and intimidation and to ensure transparency for free operation of the media, and guarantee to release political prisoners."
"All this would contribute to a democratic and transparent electoral process under appropriate security conditions."
"As we know, the European Union will dispatch a full election observation mission."
"We are hoping that these elections will be followed internationally in their entirety."
"At the first meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council at the end of this month, foreign affairs ministers will discuss the Pakistan situation in detail and debate the options the EU might have for assisting the successful continuation and strengthening of the democratic processes in that country."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the assassination of Benazir Bhutto is nothing less than a national tragedy and came as a shock to all of us."
"Mrs Bhutto was, I think for all of us, a symbol of a moderate and liberal Pakistan."
"She enjoyed popular support and she also had the courage to challenge extremism and terrorism."
"It was perhaps, unfortunately, this very courage for which she ultimately paid with her life."
"Her murder is a loss for the millions of Pakistanis who had placed hope in her for democracy and a better future."
"Her death is also a loss for Europe and the world."
"It is unfortunate that disturbing news from Pakistan has become all too common, nearly every day."
"Hardly a week passes without a major terrorist attack, and some 700 Pakistanis have been killed by suicide bombers over the past six months."
"I believe we can draw a lesson from Mrs Bhutto's death, and that is that Pakistan needs a functioning democracy, the rule of law and a strong civil society to address the country's mounting challenges."
"You will recall that the country was placed under emergency rule on 3 November."
"This, of course, greatly undermined confidence in the democratic process in advance of parliamentary elections."
"Emergency rule was then lifted on 15 December, but only after new media restrictions had been imposed and most of the senior judiciary replaced."
"A number of judges and lawyers remain in detention to this day."
"They should be released without delay."
"The outpouring of anger following the murder of Mrs Bhutto led to civil unrest and ultimately the decision to postpone elections from 8 January to 18 February."
"These elections should now be held as planned, without any further delay."
"I think Pakistan has to move ahead, and the way forward is to organise democratic and transparent elections which result in a broad and also a credible popular mandate for new governments, both at the federal but also at the provincial level."
"We should jointly pass this message to President Musharraf when he comes to visit Europe next week."
"Some players are trying to draw political capital from the Bhutto assassination."
"Let us not forget that it is, ultimately, extremist forces who are interested in destabilising Pakistan and who are responsible for this despicable act."
"They should not be allowed to succeed."
"A credible investigation into the murder can help to calm the waves, but only if everybody keeps a level head."
"Let me add that Scotland Yard is doing a commendable job in trying to help in this respect."
"President Musharraf spoke of the need for national reconciliation when he addressed the nation on 2 January."
"I think this is indeed what is required."
"The opposition has to be taken on board in coping with the current situation."
"Significantly, all major opposition parties will participate in the forthcoming elections."
"But, regrettably, Pakistan has a history of lack of trust in electoral outcomes, which could lead to further political polarisation."
"Naturally, the chances for national reconciliation will greatly improve if President Musharraf and the relevant authorities do whatever is necessary to ensure that these elections are held in a fair and transparent manner."
"Because these elections are so important, not only for Pakistan but also for the region, I decided to deploy an election observation mission (EOM) with the aim of contributing to democracy and stability in the country."
"If the elections had really been held on 8 January as originally planned, we could only have fielded a limited observation mission."
"However, in view of the time that is now available until the elections, in consultation with the Chief Observer, Mr Michael Gahler, who is a Member of this Parliament, I decided to upgrade the mission to a fully-fledged election observation mission."
"We are all very much aware of the important role this mission is likely to play in the coming weeks."
"I continue to be very concerned about the conditions in which these elections are held and the potential for this to lead to a critical statement from the EOM if steps are not urgently taken to address these concerns."
"Key problems, including lack of confidence in the election administration, lack of transparency in the results process, and the lack of an effective complaints and appeals process in which stakeholders have confidence, are all present in Pakistan."
"Concrete steps could still be taken by the state and the electoral authorities to improve the conditions for elections."
"I understand that both EU Heads of Mission in Islamabad and the election observation mission on the ground have already outlined the key improvements that are necessary."
"I think we should make every effort to stress these points with the Pakistani authorities, including with the President, when he visits Brussels soon."
"I also remain concerned about the security situation in Pakistan, particularly in the light of the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, but also recent bomb attacks in Lahore, Karachi and, of course, the North-Western Territory frontier province."
"We urge the Pakistani authorities to do all they can to provide a securer environment in which the elections can be held, and we will carefully then assess the security situation in the light of the deployment of EU observers."
"President Musharraf has taken off his uniform as promised."
"I hope that this will result in progress towards stronger civilian institutions and sustainable democracy in Pakistan."
"But it is also important that Pakistan continues to make progress in fighting poverty."
"The Commission has, therefore, significantly increased its development cooperation funding to Pakistan for the coming years, including in the field of education."
"And I remain committed to this approach, which I also see as a contribution towards fighting extremism."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Madam President, once again, following the debate and the resolution that we adopted in December, we are discussing the situation in Pakistan in Parliament."
"Since then a whole series of events have taken place, as the Commission and the Council have reminded us."
"First the state of emergency was lifted, then came the subsequent freeing, although as the Commissioner reminded us, it was incomplete, of various lawyers, magistrates, judges, journalists and representatives of civil society. This was followed by the assassination of the former Prime Minister Mrs Bhutto, which brought considerable instability to the serious process of dissolution that society is going through in Pakistan, and the subsequent postponement of the electoral process to the upcoming dates in February."
"The first thing that I would like to do, Madam President, on behalf of my political group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, is express our strongest condemnation of this savage terrorist attack, which really only affirms what the previous rapporteur, Mr Díaz de Mera, said to us: that terrorism is a phenomenon that affects all of us equally."
"Before I conclude, Madam President, I would like to leave two questions on the table for the Commission and the Council."
"I acknowledge the efforts made by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner in giving a positive response to Parliament's request for an electoral observation mission in the light of this situation."
"However, she mentioned her concern about the conditions in which the elections are held."
"Commissioner, do you think that, given the levels of violence, fear and instability in that country, which is key to the stability of Central Asia, among other things because it is the only Muslim country with nuclear weapons, do you think that the best possible conditions are in place to carry out this process?"
"Finally, Madam President, the Commissioner referred to a credible investigation."
"The family, both her widower and her son, as well as the Pakistan People's Party and Mrs Bhutto herself before she died, in a communication that she had with the UK Foreign Secretary, expressed their desire for this investigation to be conducted by the United Nations."
"Do the Commission and the Council agree that there needs to be an independent investigation to shed light on this terrible assassination once and for all?"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia, I join the Council and the Commission in the condemnation of the murder of Benazir Bhutto."
"This Parliament has always condemned terrorism wherever it occurs and we will continue to fight for the right of politicians to express their views and to campaign in safety."
"In going back to Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto knew the risks and, whether you consider her to be brave or foolhardy, you have to respect her commitment to her party and her country."
"In her memory and the memory of others who have died in this election period, I believe it is beholden on all of us - Europeans and Pakistanis from President Musharraf downwards - to do everything we can to assist Pakistan."
"As Mr Lenarčič said, the key to this must be the continuing battle against terrorism."
"We have seen that terrorism is a threat in Pakistan as much as it is in Europe or the USA."
"Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has reminded us that hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed in shootings and suicide bombs in Pakistan, so Europe must continue to fully assist and support the counter-terrorism operations in Pakistan."
"Some colleagues here might suggest we should leave Pakistan be and have little to do with it, but I firmly believe the contrary."
"As 27 strong democratic nations, we need to work collectively to support the economic, social and political developments in Pakistan."
"Again, I agree with the Council: the release of all remaining political detainees will be crucial to this process, as will ensuring free, fair, transparent and safe elections on 18 February 2008 and a safe and satisfactory run-up to that date."
"In addition to what the Commissioner said, I think the election will mean that we need to have 90 million voters with proper access to news coverage of all sides of the debate."
"It means making a safer environment for the media."
"Pakistan has become the most dangerous Asian country for the media: at least six journalists were killed in 2007, some 30 seriously injured, over 100 arrested and countless harassed."
"We need an end to the censorship of the print and broadcast media and to restrictions on what they can say and do without interference from the military or civilian authorities."
"The ban on the TV news station GEO News needs to be lifted and the government television channel PTV needs to be more balanced in its news and the information it conveys to the public."
"All arrangements for the actual voting, the counting and the reporting of the results need to be above board and clear to everyone, but most especially to the voters of Pakistan."
"A mark of democracy is also whether incumbents can accept defeat and whether political transition from one party of government to another, if it occurs, can go smoothly."
"All of these will be crucial factors in whether or not the elections can be counted as a true record of the will of the people and whether or not Pakistan can start to emerge from the long shadow cast by that assassin's bullet on 27 December 2007."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I too, of course, would like to start by expressing my great sorrow at the tragic death of Benazir Bhutto."
"Benazir Bhutto was a laureate of the Liberal International Prize For Freedom, which we presented her the first time she was Prime Minister."
"It is true that she is - she was - only human, and as such was not perfect."
"We did wonder at one point later on whether we had actually done the right thing."
"At that time, I put this question to Asma Jahangir, a Pakistani human rights activist, who is now entrusted with a special mission on behalf of the Secretary-General of the United Nations."
"She told me that we did absolutely the right thing, as Benazir Bhutto had set a genuine example in Pakistan in a number of respects, particularly as regards the role of women in Pakistani society."
"It is a known fact that Benazir Bhutto was killed by violent terrorists, but who their backers were remains an open question."
"I do not believe that reconciliation is possible in Pakistan unless this matter is clarified by an impartial investigation."
"I do not know whether this means acceding to the family's request for a UN investigation, but at all events there must be guarantees of impartiality, as President Musharraf has not exactly shown a great deal of respect for the judicial authorities, even the highest in the country."
"I would also like to say that I have been receiving reports from Pakistan of the recent rounding up, arrest and charging of thousands of PPP militants."
"This, too, has to stop if we wish the elections to take place under reasonable conditions."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I would very much like to join my voice to that of my colleagues in thanking both the Council and, indeed, the Commission in particular, for the practical steps that have been outlined in terms of helping to support the electoral administration process and to try and improve the quality and hopefully the outcome as well, of those elections should they take place."
"We also welcome the commitment to further financing for development, not least in education, because there are many of us in this House who believe that investment there will prove at least as powerful, if not more powerful than investment in weapons, which seems to have been a priority for some external bodies in their support for Pakistan over the last few years."
"We hope that the international community in general will support the efforts of the European Union in these lines."
"Like others here, we also want to express our sympathy for the family of Benazir Bhutto, but also for the families of all the bereaved in Pakistan killed in outrageous attacks and indeed through military action."
"We would agree that we do need stability, both for the people of Pakistan and indeed, given that it is a nuclear state, for the international community as well."
"But, as others have said, I do not think it is enough to try and develop people's confidence in the electoral system and its outcome."
"The judiciary is another key democratic institution."
