"The Member States, showing great flexibility, adopted the European Parliament's proposals almost in their entirety in order to achieve the common objective, the establishment of a better, more flexible system in accordance with the Commission's proposal."
"As the honourable Members rightly pointed out in their questions, the European Council and the European Parliament reached agreement on the political content of the decision as a result of the aforementioned informal meetings."
"The Council supported, for example, one of Parliament's most important proposals, namely that a mechanism be created which would encourage newer Member States to join the resettlement programme through financial instruments among other things."
"The Council, however, could not support the proposal of the European Parliament which suggested that the adoption of the common EU annual resettlement priorities happen in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty through the application of the procedure relating to delegated acts."
"The position of the Council and the Commission is identical on this."
"The programming cycle for the operation of the General Programme on Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows sets tight deadlines, and effective planning can be provided through implementing acts."
"Furthermore, the Council agreed with the Commission's opinion that defining annual resettlement priorities has only an implementing nature because essentially this means that the detailed rules in the decision are applied to specific situations."
"It is regrettable that the Council and the European Parliament were not able to agree in relation to the proposal at a level that would allow the common EU resettlement priorities to be defined for each year."
"However, we should not forget that resettlement is among the activities to be supported under the current European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013."
"It is true that, based on the proposed changes, the Member States taking part in the resettlement programme for the first time would receive somewhat greater financial support, and there would be an opportunity to define the geographic regions designated for resettlement and the nationalities in need of resettlement each year."
"Nonetheless, even now Member States are entitled to a fixed amount of EUR 4 000 for each person resettled who falls under one of the categories specified in the relevant decision."
"Apart from this, there is no obstacle to Member States which have not participated hereto starting resettlement activity under the current programme."
"It is a pleasure for me to inform you that Hungary, too, will become part of this programme next year and is prepared to participate in the resettlement programme."
"Lastly, I would like to emphasise that naturally the Council remains willing to consider all proposals that can be implemented and offer a mutually acceptable solution to outstanding issues related to this matter."
"Our aim, in accordance with the Commission's proposal, is to make the existing mechanism even more flexible and efficient."
"I would very much like this extremely important matter not to become the captive of yet another question of legal interpretation."
"There are a great many issues where very important matters are the captives of the 'implementing act' versus 'delegated act' dilemma, and I would like positive progress to be achieved in these during the Hungarian Presidency. Thank you very much."
"Mr President, I think nobody will be surprised to hear me say again that solidarity with refugees and displaced persons should constitute a fundamental element of EU policy in the areas of asylum and immigration."
"However, it is not just a question of having solidarity with those coming from weak and disadvantaged societies, but also with the Member States that, because of their geographic location, their culture or their language, suffer greater pressure in this regard."
"While numbers of applications for protection and of immigrants arriving are low in some countries, there are many other countries that are unable to tackle on their own the pressure their borders are subjected to on a daily basis."
"Following Parliament's adoption of the reports relating to the Commission communication on the Union resettlement programme and the modification of the European Refugee Fund in May 2010, we are still waiting for the Council to complete the codecision procedure."
"The pilot projects currently being undertaken in 10 Member States are a drop in an ocean, which we still have to cross."
"The southern Member States are subjected to great pressure, particularly since the popular movements in Egypt and Tunisia, and the war in Libya, began."
"Lampedusa, with a population of 5 000, has received almost 6 000 immigrants since the conflicts started."
"The aforementioned pilot projects are completely insufficient and will hardly do anything to relieve the pressure that is already affecting Italy and Malta, but will affect other Mediterranean countries in the near future."
"The Union as a whole must help these countries."
"It is imperative that the Council overcome the obstacles currently preventing the full implementation of a European resettlement programme and defeat the minorities blocking it."
"Massive population displacements and migrations affect the Union as a whole and not just a part of it."
"I am finishing, Mr President."
"Last week I called for a European Parliament presence on Libya's borders and I repeat that call now."
"It is not enough for 10 fellow Members to have spent last week in Egypt: we must have the capacity to evaluate the humanitarian situation ourselves."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, today in the Chamber we are clearly hearing a very strong cross-party request for the Council to do everything possible to make refugee resettlement a reality."
"Refugee resettlement is not the same as burden sharing."
"While we want to see improvements in the common asylum system, what we are asking for here is the removal of the barriers that make for a European resettlement system of very limited credibility, taking care of say 4000 refugees in the whole of the European Union, compared to the kind of figure that we see in the United States and Canada."
"Let us not forget that the vast majority of the world's displaced people are pouring into developing countries."
"The lesson of North Africa is that all of those people are pouring into countries unable to deal with the burden."
"The Council must unblock this situation so that we can have a credible resettlement system."
"This is an all-party request that we are making to the Council this evening."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mrs Győri, I have one figure, one observation and one question."
"One figure: there are more than 10 million refugees in the world."
"These are vulnerable people, women at risk, children and unaccompanied minors."
"This is a serious crisis, to which we need to provide answers that show our commitment to human rights."
"One observation: for one year, Parliament has given its agreement, and I join my fellow Member in asking you, Mrs Győri, to take note of the very strong consensus within Parliament on this matter."
"One question: I do not want to believe that the Council is being cynical in any way, thus leading it to use, in the procedure, the fact that the first reading is not subject to a cut-off date, in order to block the codecision process."
"Hence, what about emergency resettlement?"
"Mrs Győri, this cannot wait until 2012."
"I urge Member States to shake off the schizophrenia which leads them to take firm and consistent positions in speeches while advocating the opposite when the legal framework is starting to take shape, as it is looking like here."
"The latter must meet an imperative need, that of our world today."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I speak as a former UK Immigration Minister."
"There is no doubt that the protection of the vulnerable and those seeking genuine refuge, especially given recent events around the world, is of great importance and priority for this House and, I hope, is even more important for the Council."
"The UK, like other Member States, has played its part in resettling refugees through national resettlement programmes in the past, but it is hugely important that through a coordinated, cooperative and communicative approach we discuss how we can best reconcile assisting those most in need with the situations of those Member States that are already overburdened with national priorities."
"I am cautious, however, that programmes in this area should not undermine a nation's right to set its own policies."
"We also need cooperation and communication between Parliament and the Council, more action by the Council, more determination by the Council."
"I would like to seek a reassurance that it intends to inform this House regularly as to how it will proceed and if or how recent events in North Africa will change the pace and process."
"I should also like to know whether increases in burdens will, in the future, result in proposals for compulsory quotas of refugees for resettlement in Member States."
"Please, Council, let us get on with this."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, resettlement is an important instrument in dealing with refugees."
"Other countries such as the US resettle thousands of refugees on their territory every year."
"Resettlement is for people who have not reached, or have not tried to reach, the European Union to apply for asylum here, so for all the Heads of State who are constantly saying that we should tackle migration where it originates before it ends up in the European Union, this should be the perfect instrument."
"However, instead of the EU, it is countries that are much poorer than any of the EU Member States that take in and host great numbers of refugees, such as Pakistan and Syria."
"Since these countries lack reception facilities, many refugees have to endure unacceptable conditions."
"The EU can and should help here."
"The resettlement of Iraqi refugees in the EU has shown that it works."
"However, the number of Iraqi refugees accepted was ridiculously small."
"Many more internationally-recognised refugees need a fair chance for a new life, and I find it incredible that the Council and Commission try to prevent Parliament from exercising its parliamentary rights."
"I do not find it acceptable if you are saying that we are delaying the process: it was just us who are trying to implement our normal parliamentary rights."
"I think it is you, the Council, that is delaying it by means of not granting us these rights."
"This is not only our right, but also our duty as elected representatives of the European people."
"I would like to know your practical, precise timetable for overcoming the difficulties that you have encountered."
"Are you personally committing yourself to putting this issue on the agenda as soon as possible?"
"We are losing time every day."
"There are other instruments that would be a great asset in the current situation."
"Resettlement could also play a role in the long run when we are tackling the situation in North Africa, but there are also other instruments we have in place which are not being used. For instance, the directive on temporary protection or the internal distribution of refugees."
"These are instruments that are in place but are being not used."
"That leaves me with the impression that Member States are not willing to protect human rights, that they are timid when it comes to international protection."
"I would like to know what how you are trying to put the common asylum system into place by 2012, because that seems to be rather late to me."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we are talking about migration these days, we obviously cannot help but begin by analysing the situation in North Africa."
"On the one hand, it is to be welcomed that the peoples of North Africa have felt the wind of democracy, but on the other hand, it is lamentable that masses are dying these days, and even in these very hours."
"Children, women, innocent civilians."
"This, I must add, is only the short-term effect."
"After all, it will be in the long term that migration will truly show its negative impact."
"Let us just consider the simple fact that nearly half a million people, refugees, have left Libya in the past few days."
"The resettlement of these refugees is made particularly difficult by the fact that Western Europe is full."
"In Eastern Europe, however, it is the prevalence and ethnic ratio of the Roma that makes the reception of additional immigrants hard."
"In Western Europe the same applies to people from Black Africa, or Arabs, for that matter."
"Let us, however, ask this question: what if we settle these immigrants in Europe?"
"What will happen after that?"
"Who will provide them with jobs?"
"What about social tensions?"
"What about religious, ethnic and cultural tensions?"
"In the current situation it is absurd to settle more immigrants in Europe in such a forcible manner."
"And the reason this process, this liberal structure, has come to a halt is that this migration concept is fundamentally flawed."
"Would the liberal Members please contemplate how few of them are present in this hall, at the discussion of a topic that is so important to them?"
"Why, there are one or two Members from the liberal group here."
"Shame on you!"
"And do not even hope to achieve your goals if you participate at plenary sittings with such levels of activity."
"The European Refugee Fund should instead be used to create livelihoods for those people in North Africa and locally in the countries of the refugees, and give European people back their esteem and their work. Thank you very much."
"(PT) Mr President, I was very pleased to hear the President-in-Office of the Council stressing the importance of refugees and the resettlement programme."
"The figures from the United Nations High Commission on Refugees are clear: we are talking about millions of refugees and about more than 200 000 people in need of resettlement programmes every year."
"There is, therefore, a humanitarian emergency in the world around us: now it is not just in Afghanistan, Somalia and the Congo, but we are also facing it in Egypt, in Libya and in many other countries."
"However, as well as the humanitarian emergency there is, as Mr Papanikolaou reminded us, also the fact that we have unspent budgetary resources because these programmes have not been approved."
"That is what is happening, Mrs Enikő."
"I was also pleased to hear you saying that this process would not be paralysed because of legal issues."
"However, the truth is that this process is paralysed, to a great extent for legal reasons."
"We are in a co-decision process and we have not seen the Council disagree with Parliament's solutions."
"Mr Tavares prepared an excellent report and we see no proposals from the Council to contradict the model resettlement programme that has been designed."
"What we are seeing is the Council limited by legal issues, and that cannot happen."
"The question that Mr Tavares was asking at the start of this debate, of knowing what is the priority and if the issue of refugee resettlement is or is not important to the Presidency and the Council, is very important."
"We have the feeling that this, in fact, is not important."
"Members will be holding a Council tomorrow, after which - we already know this Council's proposed conclusions - the draft on the issue of migratory flows is being put off until the July Council."
"The recommendation that we would like to be taken from here, Mrs Enikő, is that the European Parliament is not asking the Council to delay: the European Parliament is asking the Council to decide."
"(FR) Mrs Győri, ladies and gentlemen, in the context of the humanitarian crisis in Libya, today more than ever, it is fundamental that Europe provides itself with the means of concerted action in respect of resettlement."
"Whereas, since 1 March, UNHCR has called on the international community to participate in an urgent resettlement effort, no Member State has so far made known their intention to take part."
"Only Italy has welcomed 58 Eritreans urgently evacuated from Tripoli, but I hear it said that there is a programme or proposal to resettle 4 000 people trapped in Libya."
"Hence I would like to know more on this."
"It is indeed the case that the European Union's responsibility in this area cannot allow for inaction."
"We need to show increased solidarity with these countries and with their population."
"Tunisia and Egypt have agreed to open their borders to those fleeing Libya."
"Europe must support them and play its part in the international effort for protecting refugees."
"However, beyond the urgency of the humanitarian crisis in Libya, the challenges that Europe has to face up to with regard to resettlement are many."
"I will mention three."
"Firstly, the European Union must work towards a more generous resettlement policy for those for whom resettlement is a last resort."
"In this respect, we should all have in mind that in 2009, approximately 85 000 refugees were resettled in the world, but only 8.4% were resettled in Member States of the European Union."
"In addition to this quantitative objective, any credible European resettlement policy should also ensure a high standard of preparation prior to candidates' resettlement, by taking into consideration the most vulnerable and the quality of reception and integration facilities in the host country."
"Finally, insofar as it complements the existing national asylum schemes, the European resettlement programme should, as Parliament's position in 2010 already made clear, be based on the various experiences and results within the Member States and be subject to enhanced coordination."
"(DA) Mr President, everywhere in the world, streams of refugees are on the move."
"This is partly the result of wars and unrest and partly that of natural disasters."
"These people are looking for temporary shelter."
"The vast majority of refugees go back to their homeland, but around 200 000 have to be resettled somewhere else in the world."
"Circumstances are changing constantly, however, and due to the unrest and wars in North Africa, Europe's southern borders are now under increased pressure from thousands of refugees."
"The capacities of the Member States to take these people vary considerably."
"I would therefore like to ask whether the Council can tell us what this stream of refugees will mean in terms of what proportion can be included in the resettlement programme."
"This programme will extend the EU's competence in the area of refugees and asylum."
"I view this as problematic."
"Like other Members asking questions, I too would like to ask whether the Council can give a time horizon for a response to the question of whether it is in favour of or against a joint EU resettlement programme."
"(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem we are debating is clearly a public opinion problem."
"How do we convince the Member States that a common resettlement policy is better?"
"That a Member State wishes to maintain its sovereignty in this area is not an obstacle to there being a Union policy that sets some priorities, nor does it prevent these policies being reflected in European Refugee Fund (ERF) grants."
"It is therefore urgent to break the stalemate on this issue, as there are many possible solutions."
"Perhaps the Council should consider this issue."
"If the Member States can receive financing from the ERF without any conditions being attached, then there will never be a common resettlement policy."
"Therefore, the common asylum policy is an unresolved issue that cannot be hidden away."
"Moreover, not tackling a joint strategy is unintelligent and miserly, and its only result will be that the consequences of this lack of response become worse day by day."
"It is not merely a question of values: it is that the lack of coordination and common solidarity is more costly for the Member States."
"- (SK) Mr President, almost one year ago I stated in this plenary that less than half of EU Member States had official resettlement programmes for refugees from third countries."
"Moreover, these programmes are not well coordinated."
"As a result of the low level of coordination and cooperation between EU Member States, the costs connected with resettlement are disproportionately high."
"It is still true that, given sufficient political will, we will be capable of creating an effective, fair and unified resettlement programme."
"To this end, it will be essential to create not only a programme, but also a special fund for the resettlement of refugees in the Union."
"This package would finance the creation of national resettlement programmes where they do not exist already, as well as the coordination of activities at the central level."
"Although we have long known these facts, and although political consensus has prevailed between Parliament, the Commission and the Council for at least a year, there has been no final decision."
"I would therefore like to join the call made by Members for the Council to include the completion of the co-decision process in this area among its priorities."
"(PT) Mr President, we have serious concerns about the humanitarian situation of refugees, about those fleeing from wars, armed conflicts, hunger, exploitation, penury, and of the women and child victims of human trafficking."
"Solidarity with these people is a central issue requiring concrete measures, whether in terms of aid for refugees or in terms of supporting the countries that, because of their geographic proximity, are most highly sought by refugees.."
"The recent conflicts in the countries of North Africa, added to the wars in the Middle East, have worsened an already very difficult situation."
"Therefore it is necessary to have effective and urgent measures to resettle refugees and house them in the dignity they deserve."
"We cannot continue to wait for decisions that are dragging on whilst thousands of people are knocking at our gates daily, without raising the response to which they have a right."
"(HU) Mr President, Minister of State, we can see, as you too have said, that it was the events of the past few weeks that best demonstrated how the matter of refugees could become a serious, acute issue in Europe at any moment."
"It is also quite apparent that the EU is not prepared for states of emergency, larger waves of refugees, or to provide a strategic solution to the refugee situation."
"The matter of resettlement is one of our important tools in this regard."
"And naturally, a higher degree of solidarity and better coordination should be expected."
"However, as has been said here in this debate, this area requires social consensus."
"All of us, and the Member States, too, have a lot of work to do in this area."
"Nevertheless, we appreciate the fact that the Hungarian Presidency does not intend to set up legal barriers and is showing openness and commitment with regard to settling this issue."
"(DE) Mr President, a small, elite, politically correct grouping obviously believes that we still do not have enough refugees in Europe and that the European Refugee Fund should be used to bring those who have already fled to a bordering third country into the EU because the standard of living is higher here."
"This approach seems particularly out of touch when one considers that hundreds of thousands of refugees from North Africa are already flooding into Europe and that the island of Lampedusa is already on the verge of exploding."
"A better option would be to accommodate refugees near their home countries in a cultural environment that is as familiar to them as possible, for example in Egypt and Tunisia, as this would avoid integration problems in Europe."
"Following the democratic changes, these two countries should be classified as safe third countries for refugees and that is where we should be channelling controllable, sustainable, structural aid."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, honourable Members, I will also attempt to provide specific answers to the main subjects."
"First of all, let us have a look at the record of the European Union, in that many have said here that we have fallen behind the United States and other countries in terms of generosity."
"I do not think that it is so."
"The total number of refugees resettled by the EU is, on an annual basis, indeed lower than the corresponding numbers in the US, Canada or Australia."
"And although the Council fully acknowledges that resettlement continues to be a means of permanently resolving the situation of refugees, we should keep in mind that the annual number of spontaneous asylum requests submitted to the EU far exceeds that in other regions of the world."
"According to the statistics published by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the 27 Member States of the EU received 1 150 980 asylum seekers between 2005 and 2009, whereas in Canada and the US the corresponding figure was 391 090."
"I therefore believe that these figures speak for themselves."
"Many have asked for clarification of the exact schedule that the Hungarian Presidency intends to follow."
"There is no debate among us that we must move forward; the issue is an extremely urgent one."
"I also said this in January, when the refugee situation was not yet as acute with regard to North Africa as it is now."
"This means that we have already had concrete plans, and we intend to accelerate this work."
"As you know, the Belgian Presidency, with a view to adhering to the 2012 deadline, proposed the strategy that we focus on four priority laws."
"You are familiar with all this; they are the Qualification Directive, the Dublin Regulation, the Eurodac Regulation, and the Long-term Residence Directive."
"Talks have also continued in connection with the two directives that require the most work, namely the Procedures Directive and the Reception Conditions Directive."
"At that time this strategy gained widespread support in the Council, Parliament and the Commission as well, and also yielded tangible results."
"As you know, Parliament and the Council reached an agreement on the Long-term Residence Directive, and it will be adopted officially by the Council in a matter of weeks."
"With regard to the Qualification Directive, the Hungarian presidency has been given the mandate to begin the informal trialogue."
"Our goal is therefore to start this as soon as possible, and we ask the European Parliament to be our partner in this regard."
"As regards the Dublin and Eurodac Regulations, there has been significant progress in the Council, and only a few questions of a strongly political nature remain unresolved."
"As far as the Procedures and Reception Conditions Directives are concerned, the Commission announced that it intends to submit a new proposal."
"In the previous cycle the European Parliament closed the first reading of the Reception Conditions Directive, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is currently examining the Commission's proposal for the amendment of the Procedures Directive."
"This means that both the European Parliament and the Council are currently clarifying their positions."
"This will enable the two legislators to begin talks on the Qualification Directive and the Dublin and Eurodac Regulations."
"As soon as the Commission submits its proposals concerning the Procedures and Reception Conditions Directives, work can continue on these two laws as well."
"As regards North Africa, I mentioned the Presidency visits to the frontier zone due to the current situation."
"We will evaluate the migration situation at the 11 April meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"However, I would like to indicate already at this point, as there has been some criticism here in this regard, that the current draft conclusions of the European Council also make reference to the importance of the refugee situation."
"If we deem it necessary, we will assess the progress of the work."
"We are also prepared to schedule one more special meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council during the Hungarian Presidency."
"We are therefore endeavouring to accelerate the legislative work."
"We would like to inspire you, as well as the European Commission, to do the same."
"Many, including Mr Coelho, have mentioned this problem related to the amendment of the asylum decision."
"Well, as I have also said in my introduction, there is agreement on the political content, and we are now trapped in a legal issue."
"As, by the way, there is a debate between the Council and Parliament as to whether we should resolve several issues, from novel food to various foreign policy and external financial instruments, by way of an implementing act or a delegated act."
"I would like to state that this is a very important question."
"This legal procedure, and the question of what implementing or delegated act means, takes quite some effort for citizens, for EU citizens, to comprehend."
"Our task is to find solutions to matters of utmost urgency by whatever legal formula."
"I strive very hard to adhere to the Treaty of Lisbon with every action I take."
"The Treaty does not draw a clear line between the individual acts."
"We believe that this is an implementing act, and the issue should therefore be regulated in this manner, by way of an implementing act."
"Let us talk about it and consult."
"We would, however, very much like to avoid becoming entrapped in legal matters."
"Our original plans for the June European Council already included that we address refugee issues, and this has now become an even greater priority."
"However, I believe that if we can fill the Council meetings with the appropriate substance - and it is our duty to do so - then the European Council, too, will be able to take decisions of greater importance than we had otherwise hoped, let's say, just one or two months ago."
"I was also asked a question as to what will happen if the flow of refugees comes in this direction."
"I think that we should not yet be imagining things."
"We have done a great deal so far in the area of refugee issues in the various Council formations."
"The Commission is holding its ground exceptionally well on humanitarian issues, as do, by the way, the Egyptian and Tunisian authorities and the local population, as well as the international refugee organisations."
"It seems to me that everyone is in control of the situation."
"Repatriation, which is the most urgent issue, is proceeding."
"This does not mean that these resettlements, for example, are not relevant."
"By the way, despite the fact that we have a legal problem that we have been unable to settle as yet - anyone is free to do so on a voluntary basis -, as far as I know, Italy has already voluntarily resettled 125 people, meaning that the issue is already partially being resolved after all, thanks to the honest efforts of the Member States."
"This does not mean that there is no need for the legislation."
"There is a very real need for it."
"Let us try to come to an agreement."
"Thank you very much for your attention, and as the Hungarian Presidency announced at one time that it will be a presidency that can prove that it also has a heart, as also expressed by our focus on the Roma strategy, I would like to assure you that this is also the case with regard to refugee matters. Thank you very much."
"author. - Mr President, my comment is methodological in nature."
"The Council has told us that they agree with everything except for Article 290, so after coordinating with our shadow rapporteurs, and as rapporteur for resettlement, I would like to make two comments on methodology."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Tavares, I hope you will forgive me, but we are so far behind schedule that I had to cut you off."
"The debate is closed."
"US subpoenas and EU data protection rules (debate)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on US subpoenas and EU data protection rules."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, Parliament is representing the concerns of many European citizens as it pays increased attention to US authorities requesting data from media communications companies after WikiLeaks' leaking of American state secrets."
"The Council naturally shares Parliament's concerns about respect for EU data protection rules."
"However, it is not in the possession of information from which it could determine whether the US court procedure was in violation of EU data protection laws."
"As regards the case of WikiLeaks, as referred to by several Members, the United States Attorney General has publicly admitted that there is an ongoing criminal investigation."
"As far as I know, US attorneys urged, in connection with this investigation, that an American court order Twitter to hand over specific data in a ruling, and the court did adopt the relevant ruling."
"It is not the task of the Council to comment upon how the US judicial authorities take their decisions."
"Additionally, it does not even possess information on the basis of which it could question the validity of a reasoned court ruling."
"There have been court proceedings in the United States where Twitter was able to defend its own position."
"This is also proven by the fact that the American court upheld Twitter's request to inform its clients about the court ruling."
"The European Union generally respects the court proceedings of third countries."
"It is self-evident that when investigating a suspected criminal offence, prosecution authorities must obtain information."
"It is also a well-known fact that the US procedure for obtaining information differs from that followed by the majority of EU Member States."
"The main difference lies in that it has a wider scope, meaning that it allows for far more information to be requested from a far greater number of persons than a general European criminal investigation or procedure."
"This is quite simply the result of the development of US law, meaning that it is not a matter upon which the Council should express its opinion."
"The enforcement of EU data protection rules is generally the responsibility of Member State authorities, and, more specifically, data protection authorities."
"These authorities must ensure that data protection rules are respected, and it is these authorities that have competence over matters of jurisdiction and compatibility with European or national data protection laws."
"It would be inappropriate to make matters investigated in court proceedings the subject of political judgement."
"Considering the broader context of the issue, the Council is unaware of a similar court ruling having been adopted before."
"When US authorities previously intended to obtain information relating to EU citizens that was stored within the territory of the EU, the European Union engaged in negotiations with the United States for the conclusion of an international agreement on handing over and processing the aforementioned data."
"This was the case, for example, with regard to the Passenger Name Record or PNR, in connection with which there is a PNR agreement, concluded with the United States in 2007, the renegotiation of which is currently in progress, upon the very initiative of Parliament."
"A similar case is that of handing over financial messaging data stored in the European Union to the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, or TFTP, of the US Department of Finance."
"The relevant TFTP agreement was approved by Parliament in July 2010."
"Finally, I would like to stress that the Twitter case is completely different from the PNR or TFTP cases."
"The latter two involve US authorities systematically and continuously requesting personal data for the purpose of combating crime, and especially for the fight against terrorism."
"The Twitter case, on the other hand, is about a specific court ruling adopted by a court in a specific criminal investigation."
"It is important for us to recognise the rulings of the courts of other countries as much as possible."
"Except, of course, in cases where there are factors justifying the opposite. Thank you very much, Mr President."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, in a globalised world, the protection of personal data transferred to third countries is an increasingly important and legally very complex issue."
"It goes without saying that the fundamental right to the protection of personal data also applies in the electronic world and in cross-border data processing."
"Nevertheless, as with other fundamental rights, there may be limitations to this right; any such limitations must comply with the law and they must be proportionate."
"They must also be justified by legitimate interests: national security, public safety, prevention of disorder or crime, protection of health or morals and so on."
"Under US law, a subpoena is an administrative order compelling an individual to provide a State or local administrative agency with specific information."
"The legality of an act must be determined on the basis of the law of the country where the act is carried out."
"Therefore, the assessment of the legality, proportionality and necessity of the US Government's requests must be based on the US Constitution and its legal system."
"The Commission has no competence as regards the manner in which a third country applies its judicial procedure in investigating suspected criminal activities."
"When European citizens use Twitter, they express their consent to Twitter's privacy policy."
"This policy describes its procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of personal information to third parties, including when it is necessary in order to comply with laws, regulations or legal requests from the US Government."
"Furthermore, as these personal data are sought from Twitter by the US authorities in the context of criminal investigations, the EU's data protection legislation is not applicable."
"The EU's Data Protection Directive does not apply to state activities in the area of criminal law, nor does a framework decision on data protection in police and judicial cooperation apply in this case, given that no EU Member State authority is involved in executing the US court order and that no personal data is transmitted or made available by the competent authority of another Member State."
"So that is how the law stands today."
"The global dimension of data processing should not, however, imply a lowering of the level of protection for EU citizens."
"Indeed, global processing activity demonstrates how important and necessary it is to protect data subject rights and clarify the applicable rules."
"This is particularly important nowadays, when more and more data are in the cloud."
"So what are we going to do about this?"
"First, the Commission's forthcoming proposal to reform the EU data protection framework will focus in particular on the challenges posed by globalisation and modern technologies, most of all when third-country operators target EU consumers."
"Second, as you know, on 3 December 2010, the Council gave the Commission a solid mandate with clearly defined EU objectives for negotiating the future EU-US data protection agreement in the area of police and judicial cooperation."
"One of the EU's main objectives in the forthcoming negotiations is to ensure enforceable data protection rights to data subjects on both sides of the Atlantic, regardless of nationality, and providing effective administrative and judicial redress."
"I am counting on Parliament to help this happen."
"So what are we doing in the meantime, before that new instrument becomes effective?"
"I would strongly recommend that operators be very transparent upstream with their consumers and that they indicate clearly that their service is operating primarily under US law as far as criminal investigations are concerned."
"Therefore it is clear that consumers are leaving EU jurisdiction even if they do not leave EU territory themselves."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for the clarifications."
"We are faced with a problem that is typical of the globalised world in which we live."
"The fact is that we, naturally, respect US law."
"It is also a fact that we are aware of the difficulties that arise with the global medium of the Internet and law enforcement."
"However, the fact that law enforcement agencies are now accessing private databases on a routine basis is something that requires a response from us."
"Commissioner, your words struck a chord with me because I share your ideas about how we should proceed, namely that we should regulate this matter in a dedicated future revision of the EU data protection framework, while at the same time taking the opportunity to say that we also wish to regulate and promote the EU-US Data Protection Framework Agreement because we see the need to regulate such data transfers in this global world."
"It is therefore important to remain focused on this issue, as I said earlier."
"Naturally, it is not our intention that such a process should cast a negative light on the processing of data."
"However, it is good to provide a positive example here by drafting good laws, developing the framework agreement and, in particular, better illuminating and regulating the area of law enforcement in relation to access to private data and the criteria for permitting and ending such access."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I think that the Commissioner, skilfully as usual, anticipated the questions that we have."
"First of all, what do we do in the meantime when it is now public knowledge that the US has issued a number of subpoenas directed at social networks and internet service providers like Yahoo, Twitter and Google?"
"This clearly gives the US access to information about data-sharing between WikiLeaks and third entities."
"Of course, it is the third entities - European citizens, people who are perfectly innocently accessing the internet, young people, people who are curious - who will be the targets and who will be damaged by this data regime."
"This has huge implications for the right to privacy of all EU citizens."
"Those who signed up to tweets by WikiLeaks due to an interest in the ongoing Assange case are ironically left vulnerable to US subpoenas and collection of their personal data."
"Sites like Twitter are subject to US legislation, as their servers are based in the US."
"Although I understand when you say that we cannot affect the law of third countries, we can do something in the interim."
"I think it is a legitimate concern for all of us in this House that we have to explain to our constituents what protection they can have from the European Union."
"What is the point of ensuring data protection standards for EU citizens if they can simply be lifted at the request of a US subpoena?"
"It is clear that more has to be done to safeguard the personal data of EU citizens, who should be protected by strong, high-level EU legislation."
"I know that you are working on that aim."
"Until now, Framework Directive 94/46 has provided very strong protection in the internal market, but the time has come to review the directive, increase the level of protection and extend the same protective measures to judicial and police cooperation."
"We will ensure that these objectives are reached through our future legislative work, and you have mentioned that."
"In this respect, one of the main elements that the Commission intends to introduce in the review is EU protection to withstand the US subpoenas."
"We must remember that this issue does not stop at sites like Twitter, but can apply in cases of national jurisdiction."
"We have this in one of our own Member States today with the UK census, which is a massive undertaking being overseen by an American company."
"This is a genuine and ongoing concern of EU citizens."
"You have given some partial answers today, but I think we are right to raise this and to get more detailed answers."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission."
"I am pleased to note that they share our concern."
"Let us be very clear: I do not think anybody here is claiming that the US was acting outside its jurisdiction."
"That is not the problem."
"The problem is that its jurisdiction, through the internet, becomes extremely vast."
"Its jurisdiction seems to extend even into the European Union, because the problem here is that although the vast majority of the internet-based companies we are talking about are based in the US, many of the users are based in the European Union."
"I should point out that this oral question is already a bit out of date, as there has been another court ruling in the meantime, but the argument that is being used by the American courts is that once you use Twitter, as in this case, you cannot have a legitimate expectation of privacy any more."
"That means that anybody based in the European Union - EU citizens - no longer have any legal protection, because Twitter is US-based."
"As Commissioner Reding pointed out, that is a huge problem that must be addressed in the context of the review of the Data Protection Directive."
"Commissioner, you say that once someone has used Twitter they have given consent, but what does 'consent' really mean?"
"It means that we become outlaws, that we abandon our rights to legal protection."
"I realise there is very little that we can do here, but I would like to ask what the Commission and the Council will do to provide legal protection to EU citizens."
"Will they talk to our American counterparts and try and get more information?"
"There are probably other companies that have been subpoenaed."
"Finally, you say, Commissioner, that this case cannot be compared to SWIFT because it concerns a very specific investigation, which is true."
"At the same time, they have requested large amounts of ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that this is yet another case in which we are debating the fact that different legal cultures obtain on either side of the Atlantic when it comes to personal data and, in particular, when it comes to police and judicial cooperation."
"I am actually shocked by the response from the Council, stating that the company Twitter is located in the territory of the United States and therefore the measures and legal framework applied there has nothing to do with us."
"I think that is wrong."
"I also believe that the citizens of the European Union will view things differently; after all, we are continuously increasing international cooperation at policing and judicial levels, particularly with the United States; people are increasingly confronted with the laws of other states, by which I do not just mean the laws of different Member States within the European Union, but also, in particular, US law."
"This is particularly the case when it comes to personal data."
"I would expect the Council, as the governing body of the European Union, to take up this problem and to enable the citizens of the European Union to have confidence in the laws that they encounter on the Internet, in particular as they affect their civil rights and liberties."
"(NL) Mr President, the delegation of the Dutch Freedom Party attaches particular importance to everyone's privacy and to data protection."
"We are not being short-sighted here, just pragmatic."
"However, privacy has its limits."
"Privacy should be guaranteed wherever possible, but the security of civilians must be secondary to the prevention and detection of terrorism."
"Mr President, contemporary terrorism is dominated by Islamic terrorism."
"That is the reason why we all, unfortunately, need to sacrifice a little bit of our privacy, in order to protect the security of our citizens."
"Obviously, the personal data of internet users, such as IP addresses, ought to be protected."
"This right to protection, however, is outweighed where there is a strong suspicion that the individuals who are hiding behind that data have terrorist motives."
"If the US authorities ask for data on individuals on EU territory who are associated with terrorism, they should simply be given it, but, obviously, only after proper consultation and where there are strong arguments for this, so that we can prevent abuse."
"However, let us, above all, not forget that they are not asking for information just for kicks."
"They have very good reasons for doing so."
"(ES) Mr President, Mrs Reding, I am grateful that you are here this late in the evening at this plenary debate in Brussels to listen to the Members of the European Parliament, and I would offer you my encouragement in your work on redefining EU data protection standards."
"In particular, I should like to mention the Commission communication on data protection, which you should present as a real opportunity to bring into alignment the revolution in technology and knowledge tools, on the one hand, and, on the other, advances in European constitutional law like the Treaty of Lisbon and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, fundamental rights to privacy, and all rights linked to accessing, rectifying and cancelling any personal data, in line with the European public's freedom to give their consent, but also in line with international law."
"This is because we are talking here about a bilateral framework for the European Union and its Member States to negotiate with third countries, and with the United States in particular."
"Messages on this need to be very clear: Council Framework Decision 2008/977 and Directive 95/46/EC must be updated and brought up to the minute."
"This is not just in order to be able to provide the United States with police and juridical cooperation in line with the technique of subpoena aid or with any judicial orders that could affect fundamental rights, but also to reinforce the principle of freely giving consent, of knowing what personal data are in possession of third countries and are transferred to third countries, and of how we can also update this right to rectify and cancel any data that affect personal privacy and that undergo automated processing of personal data."
"Therefore, they are submitted to online processing."
"What concerns me in particular is the issue of the rights of the child."
"This is because there are limits on the capacity of minors to act and on their capacity to possess the right to exercise fundamental rights, about which we need information."
"It is not just minors, but the minors' surroundings that are affected by techniques and tools for protecting online privacy."
"I therefore want you to know that we will follow this discussion very closely."
"We will follow the process of updating data protection rights and bringing them up to the minute very closely and, in particular, the negotiation of bilateral tools with third countries, in particular the United States."
"(DE) Mr President, the old saying 'I love treason but I hate a traitor' is something that is proven true over and over again."
"Anyone who blows the whistle on wrongdoing is celebrated as a hero by the public and the media, but viewed as a betrayer by the affected institutions."
"Thus, as we know, US Private Bradley Manning has gone to prison for passing information to WikiLeaks."
"The way in which this explosive information is handled in the land of unlimited opportunity and liberty and the fact that Twitter was compelled to reveal personal data is worse than ominous."
"It remains to be seen whether the widely rumoured demands by the US authorities for user data from other Internet companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon prove true."
"The approach taken by the US authorities and the fact that the courts do not view the publication of names, e-mail addresses and banking details as a violation of privacy are certainly symptomatic of overseas data protection provisions, which are obviously still in their infancy."
"Mr President, I will reflect on some of these issues from the perspective of the Chair of the Internal Market Committee, because I think that very fundamental economic and internal market issues are at stake here, as well as the really important issues about the protection of our citizens' rights that we have talked about today."
"I have been writing a report for my committee on this issue."
"I want to thank Ms Reding for the Green Paper on which that was based, because I think that one of the core, ambitious issues that she raised in there is at the core of what we have been discussing tonight."
"She was saying that if, as a European citizen, my data was held on a server or database in a country outside Europe's jurisdiction, I should have the same rights over that data as I would have if the server was within the European Union."
"That is a really ambitious programme."
"I hope we can achieve that."
"It will need a lot of negotiation."
"I would just say to my colleagues, particularly Ms in 't Veld, that if we are going to offer that, then other countries will demand reciprocal rights as well."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I share the legitimate concerns of this House when it comes to the protection of the private data of European citizens."
"Because I share this concern, I have presented an initial analysis on how the reform of the 1995 directive could look, in order to answer the questions which have been raised today and which do not have a legal answer under European legislation as it stands."
"There is good news regarding relations with our American counterparts."
"On 16 March, the White House took a decisive step in announcing that it intends to work with Congress to produce a privacy bill of rights."
"That is a huge change in the United States, and it could also help us in our efforts to conclude a general EU-US agreement on data privacy concerning police and judicial cooperation."
"I hope that we will be able to start the negotiations in this direction soon."
"I am counting on Parliament to help with this endeavour and with the reform of the 1995 directive."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your understanding, that is, for not disputing that we cannot intervene from here in an ongoing criminal procedure, and that in all cases the law in force at the time of an offence must be applied."
"I would like to inform you that nothing demonstrates the commitment of the Hungarian Presidency to data protection better than the fact that, at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting in February, we adopted Council conclusions on the subject of data protection, comprising about fifty items."
"In this we also addressed two very important questions to the Commission that are relevant to the present debate."
"We called attention to the importance of informing citizens, as well as to the importance of Internet-related data protection, and I am certain, as the Commissioner has also mentioned, by the way, that the Commission will take these into account when drafting its proposal."
"The Council also fully agrees that it is important to modernise legislation and adapt it to technical developments."
"We are looking forward to receiving the proposal for a new data protection directive from the Commission."
"We promised it for June, when the Hungarian Presidency will not have much time left, but we will do everything in our power, and I am sure that the Polish Presidency will approach the issue of data protection with similar commitment."
"We believe, Mr President, and with this I conclude my speech, that we do not have to choose between freedom and security, namely data security, but that these can also be ensured simultaneously, and our goal is to create such a data protection legislation for the EU."
"The debate is closed."
"Consumer rights (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Schwab, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on consumer rights - C7-0349/2008 -."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my thanks to all my fellow Members who worked on this directive and on the compromise under debate today."
"I say this not out of politeness, but out of sincere gratitude."
"They were Mrs Wallis from the Committee on Legal Affairs as the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee, Mrs Gebhardt, Mrs Turunen and Mr Rochefort, as well as Mr Triantaphyllides and Mr Bielan."
"Reaching a decision was not always an easy process, with more than 2 000 amendments tabled over the course of two years, but the discussions were always constructive and I thank you all sincerely for that."
"Despite all the technical differences on individual issues, which are given expression in the various compromises, there is general cross-group agreement on today's signal from the European Parliament that we wish to develop the internal market in the interests of consumers and businesses."
"After all, even twenty years after the internal market was established through the Single European Act, we still find that, despite a host of directives and regulations, true standardisation has not been achieved."
"The Member States have exploited their room for manoeuvre, sometimes justly, but sometimes unjustly."
"The directive before us today establishes a good middle way that regulates the issues relating to the internal market, while leaving legislative decisions on all other matters to the Member States themselves."
"We can go far with this mixed approach and will garner support from all sides of the House."
"This has involved supporting the Commission's proposal, while also improving it considerably at many points."
"We have ensured that consumer protection is given appropriate importance in this Directive by establishing a uniform fourteen-day right of withdrawal for all online contracts on an EU-wide basis; by giving consumers dealing with door-to-door sales the choice of whether to receive a printed copy or an electronic copy of the contract document; by providing a 'button solution' to bring greater transparency to Internet business and at the same time to really step up the fight against Internet scams; and, by finally establishing uniform obligations to provide information, in particular in relation to pricing, in other words full pricing information for all Internet and door-to-door transactions."
"However, we have also made the directive practicable for small and medium-sized enterprises and small contractors by providing greater flexibility and exclusions for services, in particular, in many areas; by permitting consumers to withdraw from agreements by telephone; by removing some opportunities for businesses to implement unfair contract terms, while at the same time setting down clear conditions for consumers for the return of ordered goods when a purchase is cancelled; and, by finally establishing a uniform withdrawal form that will make it easier for many people throughout Europe to access and exercise their right of withdrawal."
"In the end, thanks also to the process of consultation between the Member States, we will succeed in making further legal developments in this important area of consumer protection much less complicated at Council level than has been the case in the past."
"The Commission will have a clear right to be heard at Council level because there can be no doubt that a common market requires common rules."
"We saw this more clearly than ever during the Euro crisis."
"It is not enough to espouse common principles only to allow the Member States full freedom in the end - common principles must be adhered to through common rules."
"That is why this Directive aims to protect consumers."
"After all, consumers will be aware of their rights if they are the same throughout Europe and will be able to pursue these rights more effectively against businesses who break the rules."
"The directive also protects small and medium-sized enterprises, above all, because a uniform set of regulations engenders legal certainty, enabling the cultural and commercial diversity we so often hear about to flourish."
"Thank you for your cooperation."
"I look forward to the forthcoming debate."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schwab, honourable Members, it is a great pleasure for me that we were finally able to include the debate on this proposal in the agenda."
"As you know, the Council came to an agreement on the subject in December last year, and on 24 January 2011, already during the Hungarian Presidency, the Council officially adopted its preliminary position, that is, the general approach."
"In order to reach an agreement, we had to negotiate for over two years in the Council about what the ideal balance between EU and Member State legislation granting consumers' rights would be, and which aspects of consumer rights could be harmonised accordingly."
"Nothing illustrates the difficulties surrounding this proposal better than the fact that the Council working party needed more than sixty meetings to create a text that the qualified majority of the Member States could support."
"Additionally, it has proven impossible to reach an agreement on chapters four and five of the Commission proposal, which concern the sale of goods and unfair contract terms, respectively."
"Due to the prevailing difficulties, the Council finally decided to omit these two chapters from the text and to focus instead on off-premises and distance contracts."
"This approach was also supported by the Commission, since the Council's text creates added value with regard to such contracts at EU level."
"The Presidency believes that the European Parliament could give further impetus to the debate."
"This is why tomorrow's vote on the proposed draft amendments will be so important."
"If the European Parliament decides in tomorrow's plenary sitting to refer the dossier back to the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Hungarian Presidency will endeavour to ensure with great commitment that an agreement is reached at first reading."
"We are prepared to make every effort necessary to this end."
"Naturally, a very great deal will depend on what kind of amendments Parliament proposes."
"As I have already mentioned, there is a significant difference of opinion between Member States concerning the contents of chapters four and five, that is, the issue of whether certain aspects of sales terms and warranties, as well as unfair contract terms, need to be fully harmonised."
"The Presidency believes that the reason why it would be necessary for us to focus on other provisions of the directive, that is, chapters one and three, is that this is where we can create true European added value."
"As regards these points, the Council's general approach does not differ significantly from Parliament's draft amendments, which were carried by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the IMCO on 20 January and 1 February, respectively."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, we are ready to cooperate fully with Parliament and the Commission in order to achieve success."
"I would also like to use this opportunity to thank the rapporteur and Chair of the IMCO Committee, Mr Harbour, and all members of the IMCO Committee for their full cooperation which they have so far provided to the Hungarian Presidency."
"I do not know what the final outcome will be, and whether we will be entirely satisfied with the results of our negotiations, but I am convinced that we must not waste the opportunity to grant EU citizens consumer rights that have a far broader scope than before."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, next year we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the single market."
"We have to ensure that the single market brings benefits to consumers and to businesses."
"Over two years of negotiations have shown that it is politically very difficult to reach an agreement on the whole directive on the basis of what was proposed by the Commission."
"Many of you do not want to see - and rightly so - a decrease in the level of national consumer protection."
"We are now well into the third year of discussion on this piece of legislation."
"I believe it is high time for the co-legislators to find a solution."
"In this regard, I am particularly grateful to your committees, to the rapporteurs, to Mr Schwab and Ms Wallis and to the shadow rapporteurs for their hard work in search of a compromise."
"The Council agreed on a general approach at the beginning of the year."
"It has decided to considerably narrow the scope of the proposal and to specifically target distant and off-premises contracts."
"The Commission believes that the Council's general approach is a good starting point in our search for a good compromise."
"In broad terms, it is consistent with the aim of improving the functioning of the internal market while creating added value for consumers."
"I know that, by your amendments, you seek additional improvements."
"I can see many reasonable suggestions for further increases in consumer protection and, as I have said before, the Consumer Rights Directive should be a rights directive."
"It should be worthy of that name."
"To give you some examples: I could easily except your Amendment 122, which ensures that consumers will not be charged for sending back goods after a withdrawal if they are worth more than EUR 40."
"I am also not opposed to the extension of the withdrawal period to one year if the consumer was not informed of his right of withdrawal (Amendment 116)."
"I could also support a harmonised solution for fighting so-called internet cost traps (Paragraph 1(a) and (b) of Amendment 107)."
"It will not come as a surprise to you when I say that I cannot accept all your amendments which are now on the table."
"For example, Amendment 141."
"Even if my goal is also to serve the internal market, it is going a step too far to oblige distance traders to supply goods or deliver services in any other Member State."
"After all this time, and notwithstanding the differences which do remain, I see light at the end of the tunnel."
"I am confident that an acceptable and balanced compromise is now within our reach."
"I will do what I can to help you reach such a compromise."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Mr President, we have all been on a very long journey together and we are still travelling, hoping that we will reach our destination soon."
"I would like to thank Mr Schwab for his work on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"Over the years, we have clearly seen the difficulties posed by differing legal concepts, which form a barrier to real consumer possibilities and SME possibilities within the internal market."
"We have made some progress with the agreement that we now have in Parliament."
"Sadly, I think that the Legal Affairs Committee would have liked to have done more, for example in Chapter 5 on unfair terms, and particularly in the area of transparency."
"Our committee would really like to make progress in that area."
"I know that the Council feels that it is perhaps a step too far."
"For us, however, it is a step that could be very important in terms of the internal market and, indeed, in terms of consumer rights, as you put it so well, Commissioner."
"We have come a long way."
"We have reviewed the consumer acquis."
"We have not gone through all the directives that the Commissioner's predecessor wanted us to review."
"We may make some small steps forward."
"I hope we will keep talking, that we will keep discussing."
"Maybe we will produce something of worth."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank my colleagues for their excellent cooperation, especially Mr Schwab from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for his endless and very cooperative efforts to bring this report forward."
"The Commission's proposal left quite a lot of room for improvement."
"From the ECON Committee's perspective there are three issues which I would like to raise."
"It is good that digital goods are included in the proposal."
"It is good that there is a clear signal for the development of alternative dispute resolution methods in the future."
"Small and/or innovative financial products should be dealt with either in specific financial sector directives or in a future consumer protection directive."
"Last but not least, I would hope that the next steps taken by the Commission ensure a high level of consumer protection which could ultimately lead to full harmonisation of consumer protection regulation in the European Union."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Schwab on the work he has done so far and the excellent cooperation between the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"Providing for varying degrees of harmonisation of standards will allow us to achieve important results, which will provide real added value for European citizens."
"Significant among these are the fourteen-day right of withdrawal and the new rules on information requirements, not only on price but also on the identity and address of the seller."
"These improvements will increase consumer confidence, especially in cross-border shopping by providing the legal certainties essential for the development of e-commerce."
"This directive will also lay the foundation for other complementary measures, from the reform of European contract law to the process of reviewing alternative dispute resolution mechanisms."
"This fundamental harmonisation action is an essential condition for the development of an internal market focused on the rights of its consumers and serving the citizens of the European Union."
"About a year ago, Professor Monti said in his report to President Barroso: 'Consumers and consumer welfare should be at the centre of the next stage of the single market'."
"First, the law-maker should reach early agreement on the draft directive on consumer rights, to ensure a high level of protection in an integrated retail market."
"This provision fully meets the demands, and I am convinced that Mr Schwab will maintain the necessary determination in the complex negotiations that will follow before the final adoption of the text."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we did indeed experience some very tough negotiations, Mr Schwab, as opinions were very divided at the start of discussions."
"Likewise, it was not easy to decide on a reasonable course of action."
"However, these negotiations did succeed in achieving significant improvements, even after the vote at committee level, which finally made it possible for my group to vote in favour of this compromise package tomorrow."
"After all the discussions we have held, you will be aware of how much this means."
"We have indeed made a number of improvements."
"Accordingly, the fundamental principle followed in the directive is now, once again, minimum harmonisation - with the exception of the areas that are to be fully harmonised, which was an important concern for us."
"We excluded social services, healthcare services and games of chance from the scope of this directive because these are the areas that require special regulation."
"You cannot apply the same principles to them as to commercial services, commodities or retailing and so this was an important consideration."
"We have significantly strengthened the obligations to provide information to our citizens, the consumers."
"For this reason I would like to make it clear to the President-in-Office of the Council that the idea of dropping Chapter 2, in other words removing exactly the areas where this obligation to provide information is to apply, is something that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will not tolerate."
"We have included electronic products in the scope of the directive, something not envisaged in the Commission's original proposal."
"However, distance selling via the Internet is one of the key areas that has been included."
"As we reached the home straight, we also succeeded in improving the provisions on door-to-door selling."
"These are positive improvements that have enabled us to lend our support."
"I cannot deny that a few problems still exist, in particular the clauses relating to unfair contract terms in Chapter 5. We are very dissatisfied with these provisions and will either have to do some more work here or, if necessary, omit this section entirely."
"However, something that causes even more difficulty is the fact that financial services have been completely excluded from the obligations to provide information."
"I think we have a serious problem here."
"We will have to discuss this further, Commissioner, because financial services were included in your proposals and this should remain the case."
"To summarise: we will vote in favour of the compromise package and will also vote to refer the directive back to committee, but this does not mean that we agree to adopt the directive at first reading."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this text is important."
"It is not a revolution: we cannot say that everything before was bad and now everything is perfect."
"Nevertheless it does offer a number of major advances at this provisional stage in our work."
"To my mind, the main advances concern better regulation for distance selling, especially over the Internet (chapter III), for consumer rights in this area need to be enhanced."
"E-commerce is very useful: it widens consumers' choice, allows them to find the lowest prices and also enables small and medium-sized enterprises and craftspeople to find new outlets."
"To move forward in this area, we needed to do it in a genuinely European way, namely by carrying out, for a few very specific points, a complete harmonisation of everyone's rights and duties."
"In very specific terms, an Italian customer buying something on a Belgian or German website will know that from now on, he or she will enjoy the same rights and the same protection."
"This is what this directive will enable."
"It means that the consumer's cooling off period will be extended to 14 days throughout the Union."
"It means that he or she will know straight away the total amount to be paid, without fearing a nasty surprise later on."
"It means that with the double-click, he or she will review the order correctly."
"Obviously, all this is going to upset a few habits."
"In many Member States, national law contains subtleties that are regarded by everyone as fundamental, when often these are nowhere to be found in neighbouring countries."
"Living together in Europe is about learning to change one's habits slightly for the benefit of Community and general interest."
"Let us be clear: this text still needs to be improved and we will have to do so in the coming weeks, with the Council and with the Commission."
"I welcomed the openness that has just been shown in this respect."
"We have already done a substantial amount of work thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Schwab, whom I wish to thank wholeheartedly."
"Yet the real achievement of this work is above all the fact that the amendments will be adopted tomorrow by all political groups."
"Consumers' confidence in the Union's internal market is very fragile."
"We needed this unanimous political support in order to preserve this confidence and to hope to strengthen it."
"Mr President, I would like, firstly, to express my thanks to Mr Schwab, the rapporteur for the report under discussion, for showing such great commitment to the work on the draft of this directive."
"Two and a half years of intensive work on this document have led to the achievement of a compromise, which in its final form - I hope - will guarantee greater legal certainty to the consumers of the 27 Member States in the area of distance selling, and in particular when making Internet transactions."
"I hope, too, that thanks to this directive consumers will have greater confidence in cross-border trade and online purchases as a result of improvements to and harmonisation of some new rights and the greater clarity given to those which already exist."
"Moreover, by standardisation of information requirements for distance and off-premises contracts, for example, the directive is also intended to encourage a greater number of traders to enter the new markets in the European Union, which should in turn improve the performance of the internal market."
"I hope this will be a favourable stimulus, in particular for the popularisation of online selling."
"I hope, too, that it will benefit consumers by increasing competition for them in the internal market."
"I would like to highlight some of the most important matters."
"Firstly, we endeavoured to draft a text which would be balanced and which would work to the advantage of consumers throughout the Union, but also one which would not have an adverse effect on traders, and in particular on the operations of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Union."
"Secondly, I am pleased that we were able to negotiate a pragmatic text, with the adoption of a mixed approach of minimum and maximum harmonisation, which means, therefore, that those Member States which already have a very high level of consumer protection on some matters have not suffered."
"We also managed to introduce uniform and clear provisions in specific cases, which means that transactions made over the Internet, for example, will be easier."
"I am pleased, too, that in the Committee on Legal Affairs we managed to negotiate Chapter 5 on unfair contractual terms in a constructive form."
"This chapter regulates contracts which are not usually individually negotiated by consumers and are often a source of many abuses on the part of dishonest traders."
"I regret, however, that despite the fact that we have reached agreement, the text of the directive still contains certain shortcomings."
"However, I am certain that with commitment we will be able to correct them at the next stage of negotiations and achieve specific benefits for consumers and for European traders because, after all, they must not be forgotten either."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schwab, the EU's internal market is a cornerstone of our European cooperation and, as the Commission quite rightly wrote in its draft of the Single Market Act last year, citizens - we Europeans - must be at the centre of the work to develop the single market."
"It is important to remember that when we vote on the Directive on consumer rights in Parliament tomorrow - a directive that we have now been working on for many years."
"As we all know, the text that we are to vote on tomorrow has been comprehensively revised in relation to the draft that we received from the Commission in the autumn of 2008, as here in Parliament our focus has been on those areas where common EU rules will be of real benefit to both consumers and businesses."
"In turn, we wanted to allow the Member States to produce additional legislation where that makes sense."
"In specific terms, this means that European consumers will notice changes first and foremost when they shop on the Internet in foreign online shops."
"The new directive will mean that there are uniform rules for Internet trading in Europe, and that brings a number of advantages for consumers."
"Allow me to mention just three examples. Firstly, all consumers in Europe will have a 14-day withdrawal period when they buy something in an online shop in an EU Member State."
"Secondly, the overall price of the product must be specified before a consumer agrees to purchase a product."
"Thirdly, it has to be possible to contact the seller easily if problems arise."
"A fourth aspect that was very important to us in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance was to future-proof this Directive."
"A product is not only something that we can physically touch - these days it also includes intellectual goods."
"This could be an item of software or a piece of music that we download."
"I am therefore very pleased that digital products have now been included in the text."
"The proposal that will be voted on tomorrow, and which the Group of the Greens is able to support, is not a perfect piece of legislation."
"We wanted a broader, more ambitious directive, and we wanted to see progress in all areas."
"However, politics is also about the art of the possible, and this is what is possible right now."
"Overall, I believe that Parliament has achieved a reasonable result that will benefit consumers in Europe."
"Mr President, as a political group, we established the principle of preventing any reduction in consumer rights in the European Union from the outset."
"Although very ambitious, the Commission's initial proposal was unable to meet the needs of all consumers in the European Union."
"That is why a red line was drawn through the proposal for a fully harmonised directive, when it became clear that it would equate to a lower level of protection for EU consumers."
"There are two especially important elements in Parliament's proposal for the directive."
"We have before us a completely new proposal by Parliament, very different from that proposed by the Commission and with a different outlook from the Council."
"The nucleus of this proposal is a mixed approach in terms of harmonisation, leaving the Member States free, if they so choose, to set a higher level of consumer protection."
"The second point has to do with exemptions from the scope of the directive."
"We insisted from the outset that social services, health services and gambling should be exempted from the scope of this directive, as they have nothing to do with the relationship between trader and consumer and take a different approach."
"We are satisfied that this was taken into account."
"Support for Parliament's proposal does not under any circumstances signal unconditional support for the Commission proposal."
"On the contrary, we are seeking a strong cohesive position and we call on the Commission and the Council to take very serious account of the nucleus of Parliament's proposal, especially as regards the degree of harmonisation and other provisions for sales contracts."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, customer rights is only one of many examples of how European institutions have enormous difficulty in performing acts of great legal and political importance at this historic moment."
"We do not want to waste all the work done and the positive things achieved, for example, the contribution of our amendment on the right of recourse, aiming to introduce a distinct improvement in the activity of small traders without harming consumer rights."
"If the outcome of negotiations with the Council will be to cancel out the good things that the rapporteur and the groups introduced in a proposal that was bad from the outset, or whether the outcome will be to raise the general level of harmonisation of the Directive, we will have no option but to vote against it."
"In any case, the responsibility for this situation lies not with Parliament but with the European Commission."
"Over certain issues, we eurosceptics in the Northern League are ready to say yes to a high degree of harmonisation, but only when it coincides with common sense, the public interest, the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises, and why not, the prerogatives of Member States."
"An approach that takes account of all this was needed from the outset for an issue as complex as consumer protection."
"We welcome the withdrawal of many amendments that called into question issues that had been resolved."
"It is essential that the Council should accept the text that leaves the Chamber in full if it is compliant with the agreed amendments."
"(DE) Mr President, sometimes it is made more difficult for consumers to understand the consequences of their actions, for example, when they download digital content."
"Everyone is used to downloading content from the net free of charge."
"However, in some cases the charges are concealed from consumers and, therefore, they download a subscription without realising it, despite the fact that they only wanted a one-off service."
"What is needed here is a legal right of withdrawal."
"Another area which is open to criticism is the combination of distance and door-to-door sales, because it is much easier for people to be taken unawares on their own front doorstep."
"On the other hand, we must not impose unnecessary burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises with regard to off-premises contracts."
"For example, when consumers invite a tradesman or a hairdresser into their house of their own accord, they have no need of increased protection, because there is no question of them being taken by surprise."
"Therefore, we need sensible, wide-ranging protection for consumers, but it is also important for us to take the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises into consideration."
"Mr President, the compromise we have in front of us is a very good step in the right direction."
"I welcome the consensus we have reached on the right to withdraw and on an information requirement for distance and off-premises contracts."
"However, we must have the courage to go further, in particular on remedies for lack of conformity, guarantees and unfair clauses."
"I have listened carefully to the arguments for years, but my vision has been and remains full harmonisation."
"I am convinced that common rules are win-win for consumers and business."
"Transparency, legal certainty and competition increase free choice for the consumer and decrease red tape for business."
"The challenge is to strike the right balance."
"For high consumer protection and low costs for business the Consumer Rights Directive should not become a tug of war between market and people."
"Nor should we live under a false assumption that national rules protect consumers, while common European rules benefit business."
"That picture is wrong."
"There is no way round the fact that extra costs for SMEs will become extra costs for consumers."
"Throughout the process the PPE Group has been flexible and constructive."
"The left has been rigid and obstructive, reducing the debate to a nitpicking exercise of comparative law, bargaining between national rules."
"I believe instead that the common interest of the European people should prevail."
"Minimum harmonisation and national exceptions, as advocated by the Social Democrats, simply hinder citizens from taking full advantage of a common market."
"At a time of crisis, faced with rising protectionism, it is as easy as it is irresponsible to be populist."
"I fully support Andreas Schwab in his wonderful job and I wish him well in the negotiations ahead."
"I conclude by saying that the Consumer Rights Direcive is a milestone in the relaunch of the single market to inject confidence, to boost growth, competitiveness and the jobs that the European people are looking forward to."
"(ES) Mr President, there are fundamental points that still require improvement, so we have to send the report back to committee."
"The parliamentary passage of this report is not over, therefore."
"The initial draft was a bad one."
"That is what consumers' associations at national and European level told us."
"In particular, I have a high opinion of the Asturias Consumers' Union and its President, the tireless Dacio Alonso."
"We have managed to have the old Article 4's general principle of the maximum possible harmonisation reconsidered."
"We must state very loudly that establishing the maximum possible harmonisation across the Member States would reduce the protection of many consumers, since in many countries there is a greater tradition of protecting consumer rights."
"In any case, I should like to stress that it is essential to ensure that the list of unfair contract terms not be exhaustive, meaning that each Member State could increase the number of clauses that it considers unacceptable and invalid in contracts with consumers; that the burden of proof be reversed so that it becomes the trader that has to demonstrate that terms outside the norm have been negotiated individually; and that contract terms be expressed in a clear and comprehensible way."
"We remain opposed to the establishment of the maximum possible harmonisation as regards unfair terms."
"Eurobarometer indicates that 79% of traders believe that full harmonisation in this field will have little or no effect on their foreign activities."
"Mr President, I think you will find that I have two and a half minutes, because not all my colleagues are here."
"As Chair of the committee, I first of all want to pay tribute to all the Members who have worked on this."
"I am pleased that they are all here this evening, led by Andreas Schwab, with a very strong team of shadow members who displayed really intense interest and expertise in this whole complicated area."
"I think that it is right, as Viviane Reding says, that the co-legislators now have to move forward and make some decisions."
"The time this has taken is an indication of the political difficulties, both on the Council's side and on Parliament's side."
"I think that Parliament, as in many dossiers in the past, has shown that it has the ability to broker a compromise."
"I think that Parliament should vote on the amendments tomorrow, send a clear political signal about what we want, and then refer this back to committee."
"I want to thank the Presidency and Ms Győri, who has been a most active advocate for the Presidency, for being open to our position as a result of that change."
"That does not mean that we are in any way committed to moving forward and closing those negotiations."
"However, we owe it to citizens and consumers to hold, at the very least, an open meeting to see if there is some basis for agreement."
"I think all colleagues are in tune with that."
"Looking at what we have here, I would say, first of all, that I admire Ms Corazza Bildt's enthusiasm, but I do not really see this Consumer Rights Directive as a milestone."
"Frankly I think it is more a stepping stone, because there are still plenty of difficult waters around where we are treading at the moment."
"I think it is a first cautious step towards dealing with harmonisation on issues that cause great emotion and a lot of political agitation."
"Understandably, consumers and consumer organisations in different countries do not like to see rights taken away."
"I think that has been one of the biggest problems we have faced."
"I think we have a compromise that adds real value for consumers and for businesses, particularly in the areas of internet and cross-border trade."
"We must sustain those and also certain other areas, but my final word to the Commissioner is this: we desperately need a framework within which to make progress towards more harmonisation."
"We have a whole series of fragmented initiatives, including your work on consumer contracts, and other revisions."
"We desperately need that long-term strategic approach that will complete the stepping stones towards the milestone."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking Mr Schwab for the work he has put into this draft."
"He probably knows better than anyone that it was not an easy task."
"During our work on the directive we have often emphasised how important it is for consumers, but it is also important for trade, and in particular for e-commerce and cross-border purchases."
"What consumers making online purchases want above all is a guarantee that the goods or services they have ordered will be supplied to them, and that they will correspond to the stated quality."
"We should therefore guarantee that regulations protecting consumers are clear and transparent."
"During this debate, however, we should not forget about traders, who expect regulations which do not place an excessive burden on them."
"Have we managed to reconcile the interests of consumers with the interests of traders during our work on this directive?"
"The discussions which have being going on for nearly two years have in my opinion brought us closer to this goal, but we have not yet achieved it."
"I believe that European consumers would benefit much more from a maximum level of regulatory harmonisation."
"It would make life much easier for companies operating in the field of e-commerce."
"I am however pleased that in respect of several key issues we have managed to find solutions which ideally meet consumers' needs, while at the same time making allowances for the realities of doing business."
"As an example, I would like to mention the provisions stipulating a 14-day deadline for consumers to withdraw from a contract, and I also welcome the amendment giving traders the opportunity to make refunds dependent on the consumer supplying proof of postage."
"This is an essential feature of the directive, indicating that in certain cases there are also obligations incumbent upon consumers, as well as upon traders."
"Finally, I would like to encourage the Council and the European Commission to try to find an ambitious agreement."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mrs Gebhardt, for their work."
"The Commission's initial proposal was indeed absurd, as it endangered the level of consumer protection by wanting to harmonise it completely."
"This is only justifiable so long as harmonisation is upwards and not downwards, as proposed."
"Therefore I welcome most of the compromises reached, which leave the possibility for Member States to apply stricter rules if they so wish, while guaranteeing a high minimum level for all consumers in the Union."
"Thus, maximum contract duration is limited to 12 months, information on distance contracts or telesales contracts is improved, with payment being required only when the cooling-off period, set at 14 days, has expired."
"On the other hand, it is unacceptable to keep full harmonisation regarding chapter V, relating to unfair terms."
"Not only is the chosen level of protection unsatisfactory, it is also tantamount to ignoring the reality of fraudulent practices, since these require a level of responsiveness that European legislation cannot offer."
"That being the case, taking away all room for manoeuvre from Member States in this area seems like an irresponsible move."
"Consequently I hope that the colegislators manage to come up with a balanced text which guarantees a genuine and common core of high-level protection."
"- (CS) Mr President, I would first like to express my thanks and to applaud the work of Andreas Schwab, who has handled the 1 600 amendments so skilfully, achieving sensible compromise forms for the report."
"I am pleased that he has managed to retain the two fundamental principles of the original Commission proposal: the principle of 'better regulation' by simplifying and updating the rules so as to eliminate the barriers on the internal market encountered every day by entrepreneurs doing business in EU countries, and the second principle of achieving the greatest possible harmonisation in consumer law, eliminating the many exemptions applied by individual states."
"Despite the fact that we failed in the end to agree on full harmonisation in all chapters of the directive, this new arrangement will be a very significant step forwards, involving the elimination of barriers to cross-border trade and, in the final analysis, greater competition on the internal market."
"(DE) Mr President, I am afraid that I am going to be the person to pour cold water on this."
"Despite the many improvements to the Commission proposal that were introduced during the consultation with the committees, for which we mainly have the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, to thank, in my opinion the current package contains an excessive number of regulations and will result in over-complex legislation."
"This will be very difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular to cope with."
"In addition, it will not really benefit consumers, it will have very little effect in terms of harmonisation and it will not allow us to make progress with the internal market and with Europe as a business location."
"Given the small amount of time available, I can unfortunately only look at one point."
"The Commission proposal has massively extended the scope of two definitions and in this case it has gone much too far, which is clear from the fact that 1 600 amendments have been tabled."
"It has been difficult to discuss this sensibly in Parliament."
"In addition, the Commission has not given any justification for extending these definitions."
"Nowhere in the annexes or in the documents submitted to Parliament is there any form of justification for this."
"One of the two cases concerns distance sales contracts."
"Thankfully, this extension has been returned to the consultation process and has been amended, which is a very welcome move."
"However, the second case relates to off-premises contracts, which I would like to look at here."
"In future, any contract which is concluded outside a company's business premises will be subject to a whole raft of regulations and rights of withdrawal, even if the consumer, as Mr Obermayr has just mentioned, has asked an electrician, decorator, painter or carpenter and so on to come into his house."
"I am aware that there is a whole series of exceptions to this which you, Mr Schwab, and the committee have improved, both in terms of their content and their wording."
"Nevertheless, this still leaves a huge number of legal pitfalls in place, which could prove disastrous for micro-businesses and small tradesmen and could even put their very existence at risk."
"In my opinion, this part of the proposal is superfluous."
"It could be deleted without causing any problems, together with chapter 4 and chapter 5."
"In that case, the rest of the proposal and the consultations would not be bad at all."
"(EL) Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, and the shadow socialist rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt."
"I wish to thank them and, at the same time, to praise them, because they demonstrated a great deal of persistence and a great deal of patience in bringing us to the point that we have reached in the debate today and which, I think, provides a very good working basis for Commissioner Reding, whose words, in my opinion, give us reason to be optimistic."
"I personally consider than minimum harmonisation is a very good and, at the same time, a very pragmatic working basis."
"I come from a State, Greece, which has achieved a very high level of protection for consumer rights."
"As you will understand, I would not want this high level of consumer protection to be compromised."
"I admit that I was very concerned when Mr Schwab spoke - and this was the first I had heard of it - of maximum harmonisation."
"I remembered something I had read in a magazine: someone tried to make the most beautiful woman using an actress's eyes, a singer's nose and another actress's mouth."
"The result was monstrous."
"I make this analogy in order to demonstrate that we can start with the best intentions and fail to achieve the desired result."
"That is why I consider that minimum harmonisation is the right working basis."
"(FR) Mr President, I should first like to pay tribute to the work by our rapporteur, Mr Schwab, which enables us today to reach a broad consensus across all political groups on this text, despite it getting off to a bad start."
"Yes, Europe should be synonymous with progress and practical achievements, and we see this with these proposals concerning consumers."
"Europeans, from now on, will be entitled to the right to withdraw from the contract when they purchase items on online auction platforms such as eBay."
"We have succeeded in presenting a text that will, on the one hand, strengthen the framework conditions for increasing cross-border trade within the European Union, and, on the other, save us from having to lower the level of consumer protection in Member States; on the contrary, the latter will be increased."
"First of all, I subscribe to the view that in order to consolidate our exit from the recession, we have to create new sources of growth, and that thanks to the simplification and rationalisation of European law, our businesses will be able to benefit more fully from the potential of the single market."
"Did you know that only 22% of purchases in Europe are cross-border ones?"
"Providing a better regulatory framework for businesses is therefore also about contributing to economic recovery."
"When negotiating this text, we wanted to take an ambitious yet pragmatic approach."
"The principle was simple: no harmonisation without an equivalent level of protection."
"This is the reason why I am delighted that we have been able to keep certain aspects of national laws which the consumers of one or other Member State are very keen on."
"As far as we are concerned in France, our consumers can continue to take advantage of the protection offered by the 'latent defect' guarantee or the preservation of our very protective legislation for door-to-door selling."
"Furthermore, we are showing today that the European Parliament, right-wing and left-wing parties together, is capable of responding to people's day-to-day concerns, and I welcome that."
"The solution is of course more Europe, but not any kind. We need a Europe that protects, a Europe that reassures and a Europe that provides opportunities to Europeans, to citizens, to consumers and to businesses."
"- (CS) Mr President, in times gone by, the slogan that the 'customer is king' held true, lifetime guarantees were not the exception, and quality was a matter of honour."
"Today's world is evidently different."
"Today we must think about the rights of consumer, protection for consumers, and the legislation that will secure this."
"Customer satisfaction, it seems, is no longer always the best commercial policy, and there are almost too many examples from everyday life suggesting rather the opposite."
"That is why it is so important to have a thorough debate on this legislation, which must not bring about a deterioration in consumer rights, but will have to respond to new challenges."
"We need to realise how different the starting points of the various EU countries are in respect of consumer rights."
"Our aim should be to enhance consumer protection in those places where legal chaos and uncertainty have prevailed so far, attracting a variety of crooks and undermining confidence in the internal market."
"On the other hand, we must retain a high level of consumer protection in those places where it already exists in an effective form."
"This is the basic approach taken by the Consumer Rights Directive, and I therefore fully support the position of my group."
"I would also like to thank all the rapporteurs, of course, for the extensive work they have carried out."
"Consumer protection is really not against the interests of honest businessmen."
"Quite the opposite is true."
"(PT) Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Schwab on the persistence in negotiations that he has brought to this important compromise, and I would also pay tribute to all those who worked alongside him on this report."
"We not only wish to ensure a higher level of protection for European consumers, but also that European companies, whatever their size, should be able to provide consumers in all 27 Member States with goods and services without unnecessary legal obstacles."
"This new directive will put an end to the legislative fragmentation that has been damaging the participation in the cross-border market and will give the internal market a significant boost."
"I stress the new provisions relating to the supply of information to the consumer: this information needs to be clear, intelligible and provided in good time."
"It is also important that the burden of proving compliance with information requirements falls on the trader."
"The rules regarding distance contracts, especially those concluded over the telephone or the Internet, will have to be set out and the consumer protected using simple, effective mechanisms."
"We are sure that, when the institutional negotiations have finished, the new directive will contribute to making the European Union more competitive and dynamic, as can be expected in a global economy."
"(ES) Mr President, achieving a Consumer Rights Direcive, so establishing a horizontal instrument that will simplify, summarise and complement the four already-existing directives, is positive."
"An internal market characterised by a high level of consumer protection is key to sustainable growth and employment."
"To achieve it in accordance with the Treaty, the Member States must not be prevented from adopting measures that increase consumer protection."
"Therefore, full harmonisation should only be used on those aspects necessary to achieve a consistent framework for cross-border transactions, in order to add value."
"There is a broad consensus in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that financial services must form an integral part of this regulation in order to make it truly horizontal, that it should be coordinated with sectoral legislation at EU and national level so that there are no gaps, and that specialist advice should be sought."
"This guideline is not satisfactorily reflected in the text so it needs to be fine-tuned before the final vote."
"We still also have yet to make progress toward a European Consumers' Charter in the field of financial services."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us thank Mr Schwab for the valuable work he has put forward."
"Uniform consumer protection rules, and concepts that mean the same everywhere, give citizens confidence and at the same time guarantee increased legal certainty."
"All this matters most to those citizens and enterprises who wish to freely exercise their rights in commerce in the internal market."
"The rapporteur's proposal that the minimum level of harmonisation in consumer protection should be accompanied by the full harmonisation of technical rules is the only acceptable regulatory solution in the present situation."
"The combination of minimum and full harmonisation can become an option that is acceptable for everyone."
"The currently existing barriers to cross-border transactions hinder traders' and customers' activities across Member State borders."
"Statistics show that many are still averse to EU purchases over the Internet, and it would be welcome if we could change this, too."
"Furthermore, I would like to say, and here I am thinking mainly of Central and Eastern European Member States, that there is a great need for a comprehensive and constructive regulatory framework."
"A system founded on more transparent, common rules enhances consumer awareness, which is not yet fully mature in this region, but has been known in Western Europe for a long time."
"A developed consumer protection policy is also a means of supporting SMEs."
"We must therefore be cautious not to complicate their situation through legislation that is too strict."
"A more precise definition of traders' information obligations is a key aspect, which would contribute to increasing the number of market transactions that comply with the law and are fair from a commercial perspective."
"It is no coincidence that the Hungarian Presidency, too, considers this proposal for a directive as one of the priorities for its six-month term."
"It is symbolic and a signal that Parliament put this report on its agenda a couple of days after World Consumer Rights Day."
"By making the right decision, we can make life easier for nearly 500 million consumers and 22 million enterprises on the internal market of the European Union."
"(GA) Mr President, firstly may I congratulate Mr Schwab and his colleagues for the good work they have done for over two years now."
"Undoubtedly it has been a great achievement on their part."
"May I also commend Mrs Győri from the Hungarian Presidency: she is very enthusiastic, is here all day and is always in Strasbourg as well."
"I do not think that I have seen anyone else as enthusiastic as her so far."
"This is about the internal market, harmonisation, adding value: all very important."
"It is not the final product, but it is a work in progress: particularly noteworthy are things such as the right of withdrawal, unfair contract terms and particularly the flexibility clauses which give flexibility to national governments."
"If we had the same in other directives such as the EGAF, they would work better."
"Finally, I just want to say that it complements work such as the Services Directive and the Data Protection Directive which I am working on."
"Therefore it is good progress."
"(GA) I commend Mr Schwab for bringing the work to completion."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, please allow me to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Schwab, and Mrs Gebhardt on the work they have done."
"I have a general thought."
"It is not that protectionism is increasing, but rather that it is a case of not removing rights that already exist in some of the Member States."
"This is because if we want to set up a genuine internal market for relationships between companies and consumers and are pursuing that, we must establish, at the same time, a balance between a high level of protection for consumer rights and defence of companies' competitiveness."
"This balance involves agreeing on a minimum level of harmonisation, as well as the possibility of allowing the Member States to keep or adopt any additional regulations that improve consumer protection."
"We cannot allow the adoption of EU legislation to mean that many consumers and users end up with less protection."
"I welcome the fact that negotiations in the European Parliament have improved, but I should like to insist that already-established rights not be removed."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Schwab and his team of rapporteurs for opinions and shadow rapporteurs for their very good work on this report."
"It took a long time to choose a line that would be balanced enough for both consumers and businesses."
"I welcome the overall compromise that has been agreed by all political groups and I believe that this is an important step forward for all consumers in the European Union."
"There are significant improvements such as the provision of clear information requirements in contracts, and the harmonisation of the provisions on the right of withdrawal."
"Of course it is a compromise, it is not perfect."
"An example is Article 22a which obliges the trader to deliver in other Member States."
"There are products and services which due to their nature should not be covered here, namely perishable goods."
"Problems might also arise with digital products."
"The initial intention of promoting cross-border business is very important and is very good, and I really hope that during the forthcoming negotiations with the Council we will manage to make these adjustments to achieve an optimal result."
"(RO) Mr President, I think that every consumer should have the right to receive information prior to signing the contract."
"Retailers should inform consumers and obtain their consent, including in any circumstance where an amount is stopped on their credit or debit card."
"It is also important for us to protect consumers against unfair contractual terms."
"Unfortunately, in the case of banking services, insurance, electronic communication services or tourist services, the contractual clauses are very often written overleaf in tiny letters."
"However, customers very frequently sign the registration form or invoice without even reading the contractual clauses overleaf."
"Even in cases where customers read all the contractual clauses and state that they disagree with one of them, they do not have any negotiating power."
"In this instance, the first response the consumer receives is that there is a standard company contract and it cannot be amended."
"National consumer protection authorities should check these standard contracts to protect consumers against unfair terms."
"- (CS) Mr President, I would like to thank Andreas Schwab for an excellent piece of work, and for supporting my proposals."
"The fact that consumers are acquiring the right, under certain conditions, to the supply of goods and services ordered via the Internet to every Member State, marks a significant change in online shopping."
"One third of sellers refuse to supply goods across borders, particularly to the new Member States."
"I also believe that the Council will adopt our compromise version, including my proposals regarding an obligation to indicate the interoperability of computer equipment and electronics, the readability of contractual terms, the rights of consumers in organised sales tours and the option for Member States to extend consumer rights, including guarantees, to voluntary organisations and small businesses."
"The significance of this directive is clear."
"Equipping the European consumer with unequivocal rights is the best way to bring about fair internal trade in the EU."
"(RO) Mr President, according to the EU 2020 Strategy, a high level of consumer protection guarantees high-quality products, but it also guarantees consumer confidence, thereby making the internal markets more effective."
"With regard to consumer rights, the current minimum regulation offers all Member States the freedom to adapt EU regulations to national principles, and I think that this approach must be maintained."
"The European Union can facilitate better harmonisation of the internal market with a high level of consumer protection by raising the current minimum level of harmonisation up to the level of the best existing national practices."
"I believe that the European system of liability for lack of conformity must be fair so that consumer protection and confidence in the markets are improved, thereby increasing the service life of products."
"(HU) Mr President, the European consumer rules currently in force follow a principle of minimum harmonisation."
"They give Member States the option for derogations, while all this also represents a competitive disadvantage for the EU."
"It is to my satisfaction that Mr Schwab prepared such an excellent report."
"After several years of negotiating, the moment has come to reach an agreement on this matter, and, as Minister Győri has said, the Hungarian Presidency will also strive for this."
"In order to reduce the fragmentation of the EU internal market we need a stronger enforcement of consumer rights, and to enable consumers to take better decisions without putting enterprises at a disadvantage due to the new legislation."
"The single internal market requires single European consumer rules."
"It is therefore important that we reach an agreement at first reading."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, that was a very constructive debate in this Chamber, I must say, with all benches agreeing that we need to have a better, more constructive, more efficient Consumer Rights Directive than we have today - and also agreeing that while we might not have the perfect one, at least it is better than the existing one which is far from perfect, as everybody agrees."
"I have also rarely seen such unanimity as there has been today in the House in praising the rapporteur Andreas Schwab and his co-rapporteurs."
"I hope that this unanimity will continue, because we are now entering into a very original process, and there is a very short timespan during which we can try to achieve this better legislation that all the Members who have taken the floor from all the political parties want to have."
"Accordingly I encourage you to give your rapporteurs this report as the starting-point for negotiations."
"I know the Hungarian Presidency will do everything in its power to bring this original proceeding to a positive conclusion."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to join those who said that this has been an excellent debate."
"It has been a very constructive debate and, on behalf of the Hungarian Presidency and our experts, we would like to thank you for your support, and I hope that we will be able to continue further consultations in the same atmosphere."
"Let me address some specific questions that were raised in the debate."
"Many have urged for the regulation of the lists of unfair contract terms."
"We agree with the European Parliament in that there would be added value in having a list at European level."
"However, although the legislation in force contains an indicative list of examples, added value would in fact be in the creation of a single European list."
"There is not yet sufficient support for this in the Council, however, and this is one of the reasons why the Council decided to omit the issue."
"There were some who asked, although Mrs Gáll-Pelcz answered this one for me, why it would be necessary for us to reach an agreement at first reading."
"As it has been said, we began negotiations in October 2008, during the French Presidency."
"Over the course of two and a half years we held more than sixty working party meetings, and we therefore consider that there are no more possibilities for adjustment in order to resolve the blocking minorities, and that is why we had to decide on a significant narrowing of the scope of the directive to distance and off-premises contracts."
"The narrowed scope and thus the targeted harmonisation will, I am convinced, lead to a more rapid agreement, and I do not see what added value could come forth from continuing and having a second reading."
"The preliminary position of the European Parliament is in several respects close to the general approach of the Council, and I therefore believe that we should not, and urge us all not to waste this opportunity to have an agreement at first reading."
"I liked Mr Harbour's comment on whether the current situation is a stepping stone or a milestone."
"If we want to be realistic - and I am not a person who likes to exaggerate - I think it is a stepping stone, not a milestone."
"It could have been a milestone, but the conditions were simply not right."
"We can see it as a stepping stone when we consider the interests of our citizens and our consumers."
"We all know that there are very different legal conditions in the Member States."
"Fuller harmonisation at this stage would not have been possible."
"It is much better to have a smaller scope and be able to have an agreement."
"This will really help increase consumers' rights and therefore also help us move towards completion of the single market."
"Mr President, the question of whether or not this is a milestone is one which could be discussed at great length."
"It is clear, for example, that the founders of the European Community, such as Altiero Spinelli, whom we have named our group meeting room after today, were able to deal with more fundamental questions in Europe."
"However, I am convinced that nowadays progress in Europe takes the form of small, constructive steps."
"For this reason, I would like to thank all the Members who have taken part in the discussion and who have made this compromise possible as a result of their contributions to the amendments."
"A compromise is always an opportunity to achieve a balance between different interests."
"No one will be completely happy, but everyone will be prepared to improve the approach that has been taken even further."
"This is why I believe that we are on the right track."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs Reding, for her ongoing commitment and for her support and encouragement both today in this debate and in many other meetings."
"I hope that we can continue to count on her during the consultations with the Council."
"I would like to thank the committee chair, Mr Harbour, for his patience with the rapporteur and the other members of the committee, together with Mr Lehne, the chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"In the case of the Council, I would like Mrs Győri, a former Member of this House, to understand in her role as President-in-Office of the Council that the European Parliament may be obliged to amend the proposal which has thankfully been adopted by the Council on 24 January."
"In some areas we would like to go further and, therefore, in the next few weeks we will be holding constructive discussions in order to find a positive solution. Thank you very much."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"I welcome what is being done to strengthen consumer rights in the EU."
"I also support the proposed measures for facilitating cross-border trade, and the measures for clarifying EU rules on consumer protection in order to eliminate the current uncertainty."
"Transparency and better information for businesses and consumers would greatly contribute to consumer confidence in the market, and this would encourage economic growth."
"That said, however, I am quite worried about some of the measures and their impact on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"While these businesses are certainly in favour of measures that would create a clearer legal framework and complement existing consumer protection mechanisms, some of them are worried that some of the new provisions could impact on the day-to-day running of enterprises."
"Such measures can greatly increase red tape and the unnecessary administrative burden."
"In protecting consumers, we must be sure that we do not finish off the enterprises and services that cater to those consumers."
"in writing. - (CS) The proposed Consumer Rights Directive harmonises into one legal document a total of four directives dealing with off-premises contracts, unreasonable terms in consumer contracts, consumer protection in distance contracts and certain aspects of the selling of consumer goods and guarantees."
"The aim of merging these four directives is to enhance the internal market and promote cross-border trade."
"A high level of consumer protection will enhance product quality and increase consumer confidence, thereby boosting the efficiency of the internal market."
"We must reject the attempt to stipulate a strict two-year guarantee period, because this provision would weaken consumer protection in many states, as these Member States would have to reduce the guarantee period in their national law, thereby weakening the position of the consumer."
"The objective of boosting consumer confidence in cross-border purchases, where consumers feel the greatest barriers in terms of language problems, lack of confidence in the payment system and the unwillingness of business to trade across borders, is correct."
"The criticism from the rapporteur of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who regrets the fact that the bill fails to take account of new products emerging through changes in product development and innovation, for example digital products, is quite correct."
"In the area of entertainment and consumer electronics, products which include software and other intangible services are becoming increasingly common."
"in writing. - (SK) The lack of unity between existing laws and standards is often a disincentive for consumers and businesses who are considering participating in cross-border trade."
"Consumers and businesses encounter obstacles in relation to the differences in market conditions."
"There is a need for extensive harmonisation of the contract in question, with a view to retaining a high level of consumer rights protection in particular."
"In addition to sectoral variations, the scope of the directive would be limited mainly to off-premises contracts."
"It is these contracts that account for the greatest number of cross-border transactions."
"Also the issue as to whether a given contract is subject to the harmonised rules depends mainly on the wording of the defined terms."
"Some of these are often deficient and unsatisfactory from a legal perspective."
"There is a real need to ensure that consumers in all EU Member States are guaranteed a high level of consumer protection and for them to be able to have goods supplied and provided without unnecessary legal obstacles."
"This would help to boost consumer confidence, and also to make businesses more interested in cross-border transactions."
"in writing. - (FR) I am anxious to thank Mr Schwab and the shadow rapporteurs for their work."
"The Commission's initial proposal was unacceptable because it intended to harmonise fully the rules concerning consumer rights, without systematically bringing them into line with the most favourable national legislation."
"In other words, many Member States would have had to remove from their national legislation provisions that in fact granted better protection to consumers."
"In France, two major acquis would have to be abandoned as a result: the 'latent defect' rule and the ruling that a doorstep seller is prohibited from collecting payment before the end of the cooling-off period."
"However my socialist colleagues and I succeeded in getting this approach altered and in making minimum harmonisation the norm."
"We also managed to enhance consumer rights on a whole range of points, in particular concerning information that has to be provided by the seller and provisions pertaining to the cooling-off period."
"One problem remains however: chapter V. We cannot accept that the rules on unfair terms be fully harmonised, because that would deprive Member States of their ability to react when faced with commercial practices that change daily and sometimes involve serious risks for consumers."
"in writing. - Studies from the Commission show that one in three EU citizens purchase goods online, but only 7% do cross-border online shopping."
"Thirty-three per cent would be interested in buying cross-border."
"The field is still unregulated and it is complicated to purchase goods online, especially with regard to delivery and transaction costs."
"The proposal for a directive on consumer rights aims to reduce the complications for online actions."
"I very much welcome improved rights for consumers purchasing online."
"We need to have full information on the traders, with their names, addresses and contact details."
"The rules across the EU need to be harmonised, so that we do not face unpleasant surprises and extra costs."
"I welcome the harmonisation of the right of withdrawal within 14 days."
"We have to protect the consumers, but we also have to boost the economy."
"I fully support the rapporteur's efforts to balance this."
"Implementing the consumers' rights directive is one aspect of the problem, with full integration and implementation of single digital market, the EU's internal market and the services directive being another issue."
"The EU and its Member States have to focus on both."
"The adoption of the new harmonised European Consumer Rights Directive is certainly one of the more important pillars for a better functioning internal market."
"The harmonised directive, which brings together a number of directives relating to consumer rights, will considerably simplify the legal framework, help increase consumer confidence and encourage cross-border trade."
"In order to make trade, or the supply chain, more transparent, especially in e-commerce, we need to ensure that traders' contact details are available so that the consumer is able to contact them directly if necessary."
"I therefore support the rapporteur's proposals to this effect."
"The directive is quite a balanced one from the point of view of consumers and entrepreneurs, and it is flexible enough to accommodate differences between the Member States."
"Full consumer protection legislation is still not a reality in the European Union."
"Nevertheless, this is a big step towards better consumer protection and trade."
"in writing. - (NL) The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has for many years been consistently emphasising that consumer protection and the completion of the internal market are not conflicting objectives and that they, in fact, go hand in hand."
"This horizontal instrument codifies and clarifies the rights and obligations of consumers and traders throughout the EU."
"It also indicates that the EU is serious about meeting the needs of the most vulnerable consumers."
"Existing shortcomings in the field of online or cross-border purchases will largely be eliminated."
"This will create opportunities, not only for consumers, but also for our SMEs, which will, from now on, find it easier to benefit from the scale advantages of the internal market."
"However, if we want the best for our SMEs, we should not impose any unnecessary burdens on them."
"We therefore need to make SME-friendly amendments to the Commission proposal."
"Europe should not settle for anything less than 'cum laude' in the SME exam."
"in writing. - (IT) Our supermarkets are located further and further away from home and we are less and less likely to wander around the shelves, with a product in our hands, surrounded by the smells of fresh food and people's comments."
"Our purchases are increasingly remote and the Internet has now completely changed our habits, partly because our lives have become increasingly frenetic."
"This is a specific, tangible manifestation of something that textbooks refer to as the 'global economy'."
"What is the difference between the Internet and the supermarket?"
"On the Internet you cannot stop to ask the shopkeeper for advice about what there is to choose between one product and another or even go back to the supermarket if there is something wrong with your product and pick up another from the shelf, after showing your receipt to the cashier."
"That is why the European Consumer Rights Directive is fundamental due to the obligations it imposes over product information and due to the rules it imposes over defective products, which must be replaced, repaired or reduced in price, to ensure that protection for online sales no less strong than that for on-the-spot sales throughout Europe."
"In my opinion, the Consumer Rights Directive is one of the most important legislative texts we will debate in the first half of this year."
"Better access to information and greater consumer protection are particularly important issues, for example for the development of the online market and for economic growth throughout the EU."
"The online market is still developing relatively slowly in Europe in comparison with the United States, for example, and my home country - Poland - takes only 17th place among the EU Member States in this regard."
"Only 23% of Polish consumers make purchases over the Internet, and a lack of confidence appears to be one of the main reasons for this."
"One of the most controversial points in the proposal for a directive is the extent to which regulations should be harmonised."
"I am pleased that the rapporteur from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection agreed with the arguments put forward by my group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, criticising the European Commission's goal of full harmonisation, which would make it impossible in reality for Member States to adopt higher standards than those provided for in the directive."
"I believe that countries wishing to maintain higher standards should have the opportunity to do so."
"in writing. - Unfortunately the rights of consumers purchasing industrial or food products are better protected than those of users of transport, medical care or education services."
"This is because it is difficult to prove that the service rendered was of poor quality."
"For example, the Latvian airline Air Baltic, 51% of which belongs to the state, currently enjoys a monopoly."
"This leads to abuses in terms of passenger service and service supply."
"The director of the company, Mr Flick, has not seen fit to respond to questions from MEPs and simply ignores complaints from the general public."
"Air Baltic, with its machinations, is trying to make a fool of the European Parliament."
"It is selling business-class tickets for aircraft on which business-class service is not provided."
"In parallel, Air Baltic is concealing frequent cases of aircraft malfunctions and thus continues to risk the lives of thousands of passengers."
"It is necessary to establish an enquiry committee to look into the practices of Air Baltic, otherwise the results could be tragic."
"in writing. - (FI) The Commission's original basic proposal was fairly problematic from the point of view of both consumers and companies."
"The rapporteur has done an excellent job, though, as a result of which important steps can be taken towards more consistent consumer protection in the development of the internal market without compromising on a high level of consumer protection."
"Hopefully, this will promote crossborder distance sales."
"We have to remember, however, that there are many other factors that are still hindering the growth in ecommerce in Europe."
"In the future, we will have to work, for example, to speed up payments traffic and make the collection of crossborder payments a more effective exercise, allowing small and mediumsized enterprises to venture more readily into the European emarket."
"I would like to express my gratitude that, after tomorrow's vote, we will be able to have a legislative framework guaranteeing better harmonisation of consumer rights in the EU."
"On the other hand, I would like to congratulate the European Commission for initiating this draft directive, which combines four existing directives into a single legislative instrument."
"I also want to stress that once this directive has been implemented, we can finally guarantee citizens in the European Union's 27 Member States that they can be confident of a high level of consumer protection."
"At the same time, I want to congratulate the rapporteur for his fine work and because he added vital articles to this report which will regulate the rights of those who purchase goods and services on line."
"I would like to thank Mr Schwab and the other Members for the work they have put into this draft."
"I welcome the efforts that have been undertaken with the aim of EU-wide harmonisation of distance selling regulations, which are aimed at protecting consumers and making it easier for traders to operate."
"What is undoubtedly needed is a compromise which will both guarantee a high level of protection for consumers and make it easier for traders to provide services throughout the EU."
"I believe that it is right to guarantee a high minimum level of consumer protection throughout the European Union, provided that the Member States will also be able to impose more stringent regulations on their territory if they believe that the level of protection guaranteed by the EU is insufficient."
"However, we must not ignore the needs of traders, whose lives should genuinely be made easier by the EU-wide harmonisation of regulations, in both operational and cost-reduction terms."
"It is therefore advisable to formulate a position which will safeguard the interests of both consumers and traders."
"There can be no question that making transactions safer and harmonising regulations will increase confidence in distance selling, and act as an incentive for consumers to make distance purchases more frequently."
"Implementation of the Fuel Quality Directive (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the implementation of the Fuel Quality Directive, including an EU default value for tar sands and oil shale, by Mrs McAvan, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - B7-0209/2011)."
"author. - Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the Conference of Presidents for making time for this debate this week at very short notice."
"I would also like to thank the Commissioner for coming here at such a late hour to discuss this issue, which is very important for our Parliament."
"On the face of it, this looks like a very technical issue."
"It is about implementing measures for the Fuel Quality Directive and setting baseline or default values for greenhouse gas emissions for transport fuels."
"The real, very serious issue is: how serious are we in the European Union about tackling emissions from transport?"
"We know that around 20% of greenhouse gas emissions come from transport."
"We know that figure is rising, unlike in the housing and energy sectors, where the figure is falling."
"Cleaning up our transport fuels is a key part of the fight against climate change and that is why the Fuel Quality Directive is so important."
"That brings me to this question of tar sands and oil shale."
"Parliament was expecting the Commission's implementing proposals on the directive at the end of last year."
"There was a delay and we know the reason for this was because there was an internal debate in the Commission about whether to give a separate value to tar sands."
"We were told that the reason we could not have the measures was because there was no scientific study to back up the Commission proposal."
"In early drafts from the Commission, however, we saw there was a separate value for tar sands in the consultation papers, but in a later draft that value had disappeared."
"Thanks to you, Madam Commissioner, we now have a study on tar sands."
"That study, which came out two months ago, shows something that other studies have already shown, i.e. that greenhouse gas emissions from Canadian tar sands are on average 107.3g of CO2 per megajoule, compared with 87.1g for conventional fuels."
"For shale oil it shows a rate of 122 and 139g of CO2 per megajoule."
"In other words, it shows that these fuels are dirtier than conventional oil."
"Now we have the studies, I am hoping that we will hear from the Commissioner tonight that we are going to see a proposal to implement the Fuel Quality Directive."
"I said at the beginning that this is not just a technical issue."
"Last week, many MEPs who are here tonight received a petition from thousands of European citizens who are very concerned about this issue."
"They want what I want, which is proper, fair labelling of tar sands and oil shales."
"We often hear that the EU is leading the way on climate change, but California has already put in place a low-carbon fuel standard which assesses tar sands as high-carbon."
"I know there has been a lot of lobbying about this, we have all heard about it, we have met the different lobbyists, and even now that we know that tar sands and oil shale are dirtier than conventional oil, we are now being told 'no, let us have more studies, let us have more time'."
"But we have the facts on tar sands now, so I do not see any reason to delay."
"Tar sands are one of the most polluting ways of producing transport fuel known to man."
"It follows that they should be given a different categorisation in the Fuel Quality Directive, otherwise there is nothing to stop transport fuels getting dirtier under the Fuel Quality Directive instead of cleaner."
"Commissioner Hedegaard, I know you will hear in a moment how many of our colleagues from all groups across the House share our concerns."
"You are known for your commitment to tackling climate change and are respected for it in this House."
"We want to work with you to deliver your low-carbon roadmap to actually cut emissions from transport by 60% as you announced last week, so I hope that tonight you are going to come here with some good news for us and tell us that in the next few weeks we will have that implementing standard and we will have a higher value for tar sands and oil shale."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, we have just heard from Linda McAvan that she and the Commission share the same view of how important it is actually to tackle emissions from transport; that is also reflected in the White Paper on transport which will be coming out today."
"Unfortunately, development of the implementing measure linked to the greenhouse gas intensity reduction target contained in the Fuel Quality Directive has taken longer than anticipated."
"However, the delay will not affect the ability of suppliers to meet their requirements under the directive, as no Member State has set an intermediate target for 2014."
"In preparing its proposal the Commission has considered that the appropriate legislative approach needs to balance the accuracy and complexity of the reporting method with the degree of variability in the GHG intensities of different fuels."
"During last autumn and the first weeks of this year, extensive internal discussions have taken place within the Commission which are currently being finalised, and thus a proposal could be discussed with the Member States in the coming months."
"As concerns the default values for oil sands and oil shale, I am pleased to report that the Commission has recently published reports indicating an average default value for oil sands and a range of indicative default values for oil shales."
"These reports are available on the Commission's website."
"Given the wide interest in this matter the Commission believes that it would be useful to subject these reports to a limited peer review process."
"In taking this issue forward I have liaised closely with my colleague responsible for trade matters to ensure that our approach is robust in terms of our obligations under international law, and I will continue to do so."
"So without prejudging the outcome of the peer review process and the subsequent Commission internal consultation, it is the Commission's intention at this stage to present a draft implementing measure to the relevant regulatory committee that will include default values both for oil sands and for oil shale, as well as for other unconventional fuels such as coal to liquids and gas to liquids."
"It is also foreseen that the draft implementing measure states that the Commission will examine the GHG intensity of other categories of feedstock with high greenhouse gas emissions and, if scientifically warranted, the implementing measure will be amended through the addition of new feedstock categories."
"This would make the measure non-discriminatory by demonstrating that the list of feedstock categories is open and that the Commission is actively looking at other categories and is ready to extend the list when enough evidence and data is gathered on other categories."
"So, given that some weeks are necessary for the peer review and subsequently the finalisation of the Commission's internal discussions, there will be some delay before the draft implementing measure of the whole package can be discussed with the Member States."
"But as soon as it is approved by the regulatory committee the measure will be transmitted to the European Parliament for scrutiny."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs McAvan for tabling this question."
"The revision of the Fuel Quality Directive would not only oblige fuel suppliers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions produced throughout the life cycle of the fuels, for example during transport and during the refining process, and to measure the reduction, but also to cut the emissions per energy unit by 1% each year from 2011 onwards and by a total of 10% by 2020."
"However, I believe that it is only possible to measure the reduction in emissions during the life cycle of the fuel if there are corresponding standard values in place."
"These must finally be identified and made public."
"However, when Mrs McAvan tabled her question, I had the feeling that she would have preferred to have stopped production in this energy sector."
"I would like to warn against taking this approach, because the figures and the findings on emissions produced by the extraction of crude oil or of oil from sand or shale vary widely."
"Only an hour ago, I was speaking to a representative of the chemical industry who said that there is so much potential for technical development that it could be possible to achieve much better results in this area."
"I would like to remind the House that we are constantly talking about independence from energy sources outside the European Union."
"This raw material is available to us here in the European Union, so we should include this in our discussions."
"However, all of this will only work if there are standard values in place which must be checked."
"Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to act quickly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are indeed debating a very crucial issue: emissions from the production of oil from tar sands are three to five times greater than from other production methods and this much-desired indicator that we want in the directive will ensure that we do not subsidise this catastrophic production method."
"You said that the study has been completed."
"However, although we have a study, because we said that we needed a study in order to proceed, we now want to subject this study to peer review."
"The question, Commissioner, is when will this procedure be completed?"
"What are the timelines?"
"How much longer do we need to wait until this indicator has been reviewed, using this methodology, so that we can, at long last, include it in our legislation?"
"In fact, the problem with tar sands is not just the emissions."
"It is the destruction of unique forests, the Canadian arctic forests, our vital allies against climate change."
"At the same time, we are destroying the native land in which this massive destruction is taking place and, if we do not include the indicator in our legislation, this destruction will spread to other countries."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I want to thank Commissioner Hedegaard for her long-standing efforts on this issue and for her positive announcement this evening."
"Commissioner, you have met MEPs on a number of occasions and we appreciate that the stumbling block has not been of your making."
"Nevertheless the lack of progress has been deeply frustrating."
"First of all we were told it was not enough that there were a dozen studies that all showed that tar sands had higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil."
"We were told that there had to be a study using exactly the same methodology."
"Now that we have that study from the Joint Research Centre - and it shows the value of 107g per megajoule, way above the 87.1g average for crude oil - opponents are saying that we need a peer review."
"It really does feel like timewasting on a grand scale."
"It is a pity that the lobbying against a separate value for tar sands has come so heavily from one quarter, because it is absolutely not about discriminating against Canada."
"There are many other potential tar sand sites, some of them, as we heard just now, within the EU itself."
"The fact that these alternative sources of oil are attracting investment interest across the globe is precisely why we must insist on a separate greenhouse gas value for them."
"Otherwise, as tar sands creep up as an increasingly large part of the energy mix, we will find ourselves in the situation where we are complying with the Fuel Quality Directive's 6% reduction target on paper, but in real life we are producing fuel with even higher emissions than today."
"It would be very helpful, Commissioner, if you could explain to DG Trade, as I am sure you have, that this is not an attack on Canada, and that apart from anything else, Parliament would want this issue of the default tar sands value to be sorted out in order to ensure a smooth passage for the EU-Canada trade agreement."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the climate package, we decided that the carbon footprint of transport fuel should decrease by 6% by 2020."
"It would be completely inconsistent and senseless if we now turned a blind eye to the dirtiest fuels of all, like oil from oil sand, at the same time encouraging their production around the world, in Canada and Africa, for example."
"It is quite obvious that we should have our own default values for the carbon footprint of oil from oil sand and oil shale."
"We also need to differentiate the other sources of crude oil as soon as possible."
"In my view, the Canadian Government has very inappropriately put pressure on the EU, and we should not give way to it."
"If Canada's footprint from tar sands oil is lower than the reference value, Canada can prove it."
"Should we not adhere to the same principle with fossil oil as we do with biofuels, which is that the default values are differentiated according to the source of the raw materials?"
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, global reserves of bituminous sands are very extensive."
"It is estimated that reserves of bituminous oil are over double the size of reserves of crude oil extracted using conventional methods."
"Present-day technologies make it possible to exploit deposits of raw materials in places where no one would previously have supposed it to be possible."
"At the same time, however, environmental protection requirements have become more stringent, and so there is a clash between environmental standards and the pursuit of raw materials and the desire to extract them at any cost."
"This results in land degradation, deforestation and the exploitation of water resources."
"Extracting companies must be forced to recultivate the land they have used, to make it possible for forests to grow there again one day."
"Companies which make profits from the processing of bituminous sands must allocate some of these profits to environmental protection, for example in the form of a deposit."
"The European Commission should support such requirements and technologies for reducing CO2 emissions."
"After all, Europe and Canada have such strong economic links that Canadian industry, whether it wants to or not, must adapt to European environmental protection requirements in order to operate on the European market, for example in this area."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs McAvan for taking the initiative in this case and Mrs Hedegaard for addressing the problem."
"We are not happy about the speed at which things are happening, but we know that this matter is in good hands with Mrs Hedegaard."
"We would like to support her during the discussions within the Commission and with everyone else involved."
"The environmental impact of tar sands is clear."
"There is an exhibition outside Parliament which makes it clear that, although we may question some of what is said or some of the figures, we have a serious environmental problem on our hands."
"This is indisputable."
"Given that we have discussed the effects of biofuels in such detail and even planned to carry out indirect investigations of movements in food cultivation, we must look at this problem, which is so obvious, much more closely."
"For this reason, this is an important initiative."
"During the debate and during the preparations, I had a sentence running through my head which has been said repeatedly by the German Environment Minister, Norbert Röttgen: We have already picked the low-hanging fruit when it comes to fossil fuels."
"This becomes clear in the context of this subject and in the light of the exhibition outside Parliament."
"Extracting all our additional deposits of fossil fuels will involve a huge amount of work and give rise to new problems."
"Therefore, I would like to point out once again this evening that we all have cause to think more carefully about energy efficiency, especially given the events of recent days."
"I would like us to exert greater pressure on the Commission and on Mr Oettinger to follow up the 20% target for energy efficiency."
"I hope that the Directorate General for Mobility and Transport and the Transport Commissioner will be able to come up with specific measures rather than just empty words over the next few years and that they will not wait to do so until the next parliamentary term."
"(NL) Mr President, in the square outside our Parliament there is a photographic exhibition on the tar sands in Canada."
"One of the photographs really chills you to the bone."
"You see beautiful virgin forests and then a sharp line which marks the beginning of a polluted black oily lake measuring 170 sq. metres."
"This really chills you to the very bone and I would recommend that everyone goes and sees the exhibition this evening."
"Apart from leading to a huge loss of biodiversity, tar sand oil also emits extremely high levels of CO2."
"As far as I am concerned, biodiversity and CO2 emissions alone are sufficient reasons for us to vigorously oppose the exploitation of the tar sands in Canada, as well as in other countries."
"However, the least we can do is to include the polluting value of tar sand oil in the Fuel Quality Directive."
"Having listened to what Mrs Hedegaard said, I assume that will happen, but I hope that she will also more vehemently oppose the exploitation of the tar sands in Canada and in other parts of the world."
"(RO) Mr President, significant results can be achieved in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 if investments are made in measures for increasing energy efficiency in buildings and the transport sector."
"We had wide-ranging debates at the time when the Fuel Quality Directive was adopted."
"The car manufacturing industry thought then that, in order to increase the share of fuel deriving from biofuels, it needed a longer period for designing and manufacturing new engines capable of coping with increased vapour pressure."
"However, the directive's final text makes it compulsory for both car manufacturers and fuel producers to invest in reducing polluting emissions and improving fuel quality."
"I think that, in order to reduce the polluting emissions produced by the transport sector, the European Union should invest as a priority in developing a pan-European smart electricity grid which is capable of receiving energy produced locally and regionally from renewable energy sources and will be integrated into the infrastructure required for using electric vehicles."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, I must say that this directive gives rise to serious concerns among the oil processing companies of Central and Eastern Europe."
"This is not even because it has yet to come into effect, but rather because we are curious as to the methods by which emissions will be calculated."
"Will it be the 'fixed' method, which is based on an EU average, or the 'hybrid' method, which will calculate emissions from the time and place of extraction?"
"If it is the latter, producers working with Russian oil would actually have to reduce their GHG emissions by 12%, since pollution is already high at the site of extraction."
"Commissioner, I sent you a letter in this regard in January, together with four of my colleagues, and we have received your reply, but that reply has not dispelled our doubts fully."
"I would therefore like to ask you to reassure me, if possible, that this law will not put oil processing companies that process Russian petrol at a disadvantage, and will consequently not put Central and Eastern European Member States in a discriminative situation."
"(GA) Mr President, I am not a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE);"
"I should be, I would like to be, and I hope to be a member of it."
"If anyone is leaving it, or if they are thinking of expelling anyone, let me know and I will get a place."
"The Commission brought out a very good document on energy efficiency a few weeks ago."
"It pointed out the need for more work to be done on buildings and transport and I agree 100% on that."
"Regarding transport, much more needs to be done in putting strictures on those who produce vehicles to come up with more fuel-efficient vehicles."
"That is a very important point and not enough has been done on that."
"I am a member of the Delegation for Relations with Canada, and the Canadians made a presentation to us yesterday about this matter."
"They are willing to take us out to show us how it works, and until such time as the technologies have been developed, we should keep a more open mind regarding these oil sands and shales."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Parliament for the very clear message it has given here tonight."
"I think it is very clear - including the impatience and sense of urgency."
"Mr Schnellhardt said that we should act promptly and Mr Arsenis asked particularly, with regard to the timetable: when will this end?"
"I am happy to say that we are talking about a rather short time now."
"There is the peer review where we are talking about weeks, then it has to come back after that to the Commission, and there will then be the internal process."
"It will not end there but at least we will start to get it through to the next stage which is with the Member States."
"So we are coming close but, as Mrs Hall was saying, this is absolutely not a discriminatory initiative, and I think you all understand why it makes sense to take care that its documentation is robust."
"That is what we have provided and we all know what the reasons are."
"One of the reasons is that it was not included from the very outset when this case started several years back."
"Now we are doing this work and so we can bring it to an end."
"Let me finish by saying that, when it comes to this default value for tar sands the overall delay in the implementation of the directive means that we could get the default value included now in the same sort of round as when we are implementing the directive as such."
"In that sense, when it comes to the default value for tar sands, we will be able to do it a bit quicker than some of us thought possible when we started this nine months ago."
"Thank you for the very clear message."
"As I hope you realise, we are working very hard to bring this to an end."
"The debate is closed."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - Having visited the oil sands in Canada last year, I am an eyewitness of this phenomenon."
"I had the opportunity to engage in extensive consultations with the Albertan Government and the Federal Government in Canada regarding this issue."
"Before I went to Canada, Friends of the Earth Europe, WWF and Transport and Environment gave me questions to ask the Albertan Government regarding the oil sands."
"I received answers to all of these questions from the Albertan Minister for International Relations."
"It was conveyed to me that Canada is fully committed to reducing global GHG emissions and de-carbonising fossil fuels, and has pointed out that studies show that the GHG intensity of oil from tar sands can be equal to or less than some other fuels."
"On the other hand there are remaining concerns about public health, biodiversity and local wildlife."
"I would encourage the Commission to send an expert group to visit the oil sands in Canada to conduct an independent analysis of the oil sands, as it will be proposing amendments to the Fuel Quality Directive before December 2012, with a possibility of introducing additional measures for suppliers to reduce by 2% the lifecycle GHG per unit of energy."
"in writing. - (CS) A struggle has been going on in Canada for many years between nature conservationists and investors, who are unfortunately showing ever less regard for the protection of nature as global prices and demand for oil rise."
"The supra-national oil companies regard environmental protection merely as an expense item that must be reduced."
"Their disregard does not even stop at the de facto genocide of local populations that depend on the environment for their livelihood."
"The alarming growth in numbers of cancer sufferers among local populations is a direct result of reckless extraction."
"We have become used to valuing everything in terms of money."
"In the global variant of the board game Monopoly which we call economics, we see only the short-term profit."
"We take no account of what we will ultimately pay for the further deforestation of the temperate zone and the grassing over of whole ecosystems in a much longer and more serious game of survival."
"Under the current economic and political circumstances, resources will simply be exhausted, and the anticipated damage to the environment will occur."
"The profits are too tempting, and the thirst for energy is too great."
"Who will decide?"
"The people and their democratically-elected representatives, or the money men and managers of oil companies?"
"Unless Europe takes a firm stand over the unsustainable extraction of tar sands and oil shales, then we are merely engaging in political theatre, which shows we are interested in the issue, while in reality we have neither the will nor the power to change the situation."
"Generalised tariff preferences (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Scholz, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011 - C7-0135/2010 - 2010/140(COD))."
"Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing an important aspect of international trade policy very late in the day."
"Given its importance, I would have preferred the House to be full, with all the seats occupied."
"The European Union's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is a major achievement of European trade policy."
"It opens up our market to the poorest countries in the world for all types of goods except arms."
"It also gives developing countries trade concessions on a whole range of products."
"GSP+ is a valuable incentive system which offers developing countries further concessions if they sign and put into practice important international agreements on human rights, labour standards and protecting the environment."
"However, the system does have weak points and it needs to be updated regularly."
"Over the years, the European Parliament, partner countries, companies and non-governmental organisations have made important suggestions for improving the system."
"The whole world is now waiting for the Commission to issue its proposal on the much-needed revision of the system."
"The deadline for this proposal was 1 June 2010."
"The Commission has not delivered on time and its failure to do so has left the countries involved and companies both inside and outside the EU in a dangerous state of uncertainty."
"The existing regulation must now be revised."
"You are attempting to rescue the situation by means of a transitional regulation and this is what we will be voting on tomorrow, that is on Thursday."
"The transitional regulation is simply an extension."
"It does not change anything, it does not improve anything and it does not implement the new requirements resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This has given rise to feelings not only of surprise but also of displeasure within the European Parliament and, as the rapporteur, I have felt the same."
"It is the obligation of the Members of this Parliament to ensure that the rights, the duties and also the powers granted to the elected representatives of the citizens of Europe by the Treaty of Lisbon are respected."
"It is also our obligation to make sure that the reduction in tariffs brings about a genuine improvement in the situation of the developing countries."
"In order to protect the EU's partners from the consequences of a long-drawn-out procedure, I suggested initially to the Committee on International Trade that only those elements of the regulation should be amended which are necessary to allow Parliament to fulfil its new role."
"At the same time, I would like to emphasise that I also believe a general redrafting of the GSP and GSP+ schemes is needed."
"During the intensive meetings with the Council and the Commission on the legal issues resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon which affect the transitional regulation, Parliament finally decided to take a big leap of faith."
"At this point, I would like once again to express my sincere thanks to the chair of the Committee on International Trade, Professor Moreira, for his untiring efforts as mediator and also to you, Mr De Gucht, for the Commission's assurance that key amendments, in particular with regard to informing and involving Parliament, would be addressed in practice."
"Therefore, we decided to drop all our amendments, in order to enable the transitional regulation to come into force as quickly as possible."
"We did this primarily in the interests of our partners and of the companies which are affected."
"The Commission's assurance includes a promise in future to inform the European Parliament in full, immediately and at the same time as the Council about work relating to essential aspects of the GSP and about all developments and to share all documents relating to the GSP."
"The Commission also guarantees that the European Parliament will be notified about any suspension of preferences, in accordance with Article 16(3), about withdrawals, including the corresponding investigation reports from the Commission, in accordance with Article 17, and about safeguard decisions, in accordance with Articles 20 and 21, before they come into force."
"We welcome the tabling of Omnibus 1 and the Commission's readiness to enter into an in-depth discussion of the proposals which it has made in Omnibus 1."
"At the same time, we would like to remind the Commission that Omnibus 2 must be tabled urgently."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise once again that Parliament has made a concession on the transitional regulation."
"We must not forget that we need to fight for the ongoing and fundamental implementation of Parliament's parliamentary rights."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Scholz, ladies and gentlemen."
"Mr President, let me continue in English."
"Because of the terminology, I think that it is more appropriate to use English."
"Ever since the Commission presented its proposal to extend, for a limited period of time, the application of the current GSP regulation - the so-called roll-over proposal - the Council has been consistently reiterating before this House the importance of adopting this proposal in good time."
"This is to ensure that developing and less developed countries will continue to benefit from the EU's general system of preferences, which is a fundamental element of the EU's trade policy towards developing countries."
"The Council is glad to see that the first step towards the adoption of this proposal at first reading is taking place today here in the European Parliament."
"We will take the necessary steps as quickly as possible to confirm the agreement between our institutions on the basis of your position adopted today."
"At the same time, the Council is looking forward to the forthcoming presentation by the Commission of its proposal for the comprehensive review of the EU's GSP."
"We should tailor the scheme to better help those developing economies which most need the preferences, and ensure that it becomes an even more efficient development and foreign policy tool by providing incentives for good governance."
"With that in mind, the Council expresses its readiness to work together with Parliament in a spirit of good cooperation with a view to putting in place a modern, comprehensive and fully functional legal framework which will be conducive to developing countries' needs."
"Let me conclude by taking this opportunity to fully acknowledge, on behalf of the Presidency, the positive and constructive efforts by both the Chair of the INTA Committee, Mr Moreira, and the rapporteur for this dossier, Mr Scholz, to reach an agreement on this proposal."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I warmly acknowledge the support within the Committee on International Trade for the proposal on the extension of the regulation applying the scheme of generalised tariff preferences."
"Our particular thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Scholz and to the Chair of the INTA committee, Mr Moreira, for their willingness to find a pragmatic solution on how to address Parliament's concerns on the application to the existing GSP regulation of the new rules on delegated and implementing acts."
"You will remember that the extension was proposed as a means to bridge the period necessary to adjust to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and to submit a new regulation on the future EU GSP scheme."
"The European Parliament's support as expressed in the INTA Committee's vote on 3 March paves the way for successful continuity of the current scheme to the benefit of developing countries and the EU."
"It also reinforces the EU's role and commitment to the objectives of EU development policy."
"The Commission has heard Parliament's concerns on the decision-making aspects of the GSP regulation loud and clear."
"In this regard, we can reconfirm our full and active support for the European Parliament to play its role in relation to trade policy as foreseen in the Lisbon Treaty."
"For this reason, the Commission is committed to discussing in a constructive spirit Parliament's concern as expressed over the last few weeks."
"This discussion will continue in the context of the two Commission proposals for a regulation adjusting decision-making in the field of trade policy in the light of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty - Omnibus I and Omnibus II."
"In parallel, the Commission will make every effort to act on Parliament's request to be kept fully informed about work related to essential aspects of GSP."
"This is indeed crucial in order for Parliament to be able play its role in trade policy effectively."
"For this reason, the Commission, building on existing requirements, will inform Parliament and the Council immediately of all important developments and share all GSP-relevant documents."
"Finally we are looking forward to further discussions with you on the future scheme of generalised preferences further to the proposal for a new regulation which will come your way in May."
"I stand ready to discuss the main elements of the proposal at the earliest opportunity after it is adopted by the Commission."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (HU) Mr President, I am very pleased that the rapporteur's willingness to compromise made the timely extension of the scheme of tariff preferences possible."
"The Hungarian Presidency of the European Council played a very important part in this process."
"Failure to extend the scheme of tariff preferences now would have an extremely adverse effect on the poorest countries of the world."
"It is regrettable, however, that the European Commission submitted this proposal to Parliament late, and we could not have a meaningful debate here, even though the GSP Regulation would deserve an amendment."
"That is because the tariff preferences we are granting to the richest oil exporting countries of the world, such as the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia, are unjustifiable."
"It is worth considering whether Russia, which is not a member of the WTO because it did not wish to join it, and very often uses commercial policy to exert foreign policy pressure, is worthy of receiving commercial preferences."
"It is also worth considering how we could integrate sustainability criteria into the scheme of tariff preferences."
"After all, today commercial preferences are also granted to countries which otherwise hinder the adoption of climate protection agreements on the international scene or, for that matter, export to the European Union goods produced in an unsustainable manner, often through the destruction of rainforests or tremendous CO2 emissions."
"I believe that the next tariff preference scheme will have to address these issues as well."
"Mr President, if we are here debating how long the current scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP) will be in force, it is because the Commission has failed in its obligation to table the proposed substantive revision of this scheme within the proper timeframe."
"Therefore a rollover period for the current regulation is expected in order to maintain the benefits of international trade enjoyed by developing countries, starting with the poorest, when accessing the European market."
"It is crucial that this proposal be adopted without further delay, in order for countries benefitting from the GSP to continue to benefit from it, and for the economic players that will, in this way, be able to develop their trade relations with the necessary predictability and legal security."
"That is why I, as Chair of the Committee on International Trade and as shadow rapporteur, have advocated that the rollover should be a rollover and nothing more, with even the European Parliament giving up on an ad hoc adaptation of this regulation to the Commission's implementing acts, and giving us faith that it will be brought into line in the near future, using the so-called 'omnibus' regulations."
"I would like to stress that, based on this understanding, the decision taken by the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and the remaining members of the committee, influenced the European Commission's commitment - which was today reiterated by Commissioner De Gucht and I sincerely thank him for his care - to henceforth guarantee the European Parliament that there will be timely and complete information about every relevant act relating to the application of the current regulation, in line with the Treaty of Lisbon's provisions regarding the common commercial policy."
"One final word to thank the rapporteur, to thank the Commission and also to thank the Council for this compromise, which will enable Parliament to properly look after the interests of Europe and of those who rely on us."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Generalised System of Preferences is one of the few methods of differentiation that works in favour of developing countries in international trade."
"It is a delicate instrument that must be used in the best way."
"Tonight we are talking about an extension, which means that the Commission date will be postponed once the new final proposal has been submitted."
"In the meantime, however, we are saying that this is a tool to be handled with caution, and that also applies to inter-institutional relations."
"Until now, even on the basis of the pre-Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament has not always been fully involved in decisions, as happened at the time of the discussions on Colombia or Sri Lanka that fired the enthusiasm of this House."
"We must also consider the merits of an ex-post evaluation of the decision to implement the regulation."
"What is the impact of the effects of a tariff reduction, what about its suspension, what are its mechanisms, what is its procedure?"
"Sometimes an on-the-spot examination of these issues may reveal surprises and suggest the most relevant criteria to make the impact of the regulation as effective as possible."
"As far as the conditions are concerned, the world is changing and the instrument must show greater compliance with regard to those countries rewarded by the tariff concessions."
"The main concept of respect for human rights must be complemented by a broader vision in which, as noted by the rapporteur Mr Scholz - whom I thank for the excellent work he has done in this report - various indicators are taken into consideration: post-conflict rehabilitation, the specific situation of women, trade unions, the situation of recovery after natural disasters, environmental sustainability and compliance with international social agreements."
"If we were to adopt a combination of these criteria, I would not be surprised if the list of beneficiary countries we came up with were different from the current list and perhaps more deserving, but we will be able to talk about this again once we have the final proposal for a regulation."
"(PT) Mr President, given that the current scheme of generalised tariff preferences expires at the end of the year, it is important, as has already been said, for the Commission to table its new draft of the comprehensive revision of the system on time."
"Now we are only just discussing the extension necessary to ensure legal certainty and guarantee mutual interests."
"However, the importance of this subject whether for developing countries or also EU Member States, above all for those with weaker economies whose industrial, agricultural or social interests are not always taken into consideration in the international trade agreements promoted by the Commission, makes a detailed discussion necessary in order to take account of all the potential aspects, consequences and impacts of this system on a future regulation, the draft of which must reach Parliament as quickly as possible."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this measure concerns the Generalised System of Preferences, in other words reductions on import duties for third countries which take on certain commitments to international treaties or agreements on sensitive issues such as employment rights and the environment."
"These requirements should be periodically reviewed and updated on the proposal of the European Commission, but unfortunately we are not here to vote for a revision but an extension of the old rules."
"At this sensitive time of not only economic but also political international crisis, not to revise and update the conditions for access to or exclusion from the list is a choice that goes against the best interests of the European Union."
"Despite the non-linear behaviour of the European Commission, we will still nevertheless vote in favour, because we believe in this tool favouring third countries that particularly distinguish themselves compared with others over issues considered to be strategic."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I listened to the interventions."
"I understand that the groups agree that we should extend the existing system, but that they are waiting to have the new system on their desks as soon as possible."
"That is what we will do."
"We are working on it."
"As you know, before you can make a legislative proposal you need a public consultation, which takes time."
"You need an impact assessment, which takes time."
"Then, of course, you also have the internal decision-making process within the European Commission, on a subject which is far-reaching."
"This is about a financial system which will apply for quite a period of time."
"We want the system to be much more selective than it was in the past, so that we can help those who really need it."
"At this moment in time, more than 150 countries are beneficiaries of the system."
"It is not at all selective."
"You could even ask yourself what the use of such a system is."
"We are thoroughly reviewing it."
"We will come forward with our proposals within a couple of months."
"Parliament will then have the possibility to discuss them with us thoroughly."
"I would also like to repeat our pledge that we will keep Parliament fully informed."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, the reform of the GSP will be a focal point for the Council and for the Presidency."
"With the review of the current scheme, which is to start under our Presidency, Parliament and the Council will have a unique opportunity to reflect the profound changes in the global economy, particularly the vastly increased competitiveness of emerging partners."
"The Presidency took careful note of the valid concerns emphasised by Mr Rinaldi on the effective implementation of the GSP."
"The Council is looking forward to considering that issue and many others on the basis of the Commission's forthcoming proposal for the new GSP."
"Let me emphasise once again how grateful I am to the rapporteur and to the Committee Chair, Mr Moreira, for their cooperation."
"I think this is a victory for common sense, because they understood that it was an urgent and important issue."
"We really did not want to create any legal problems."
"For me this is a kind of model and I very much hope that, on other issues on which we have such legal disputes, this will serve as a very good example of smooth relations between the Council and Parliament."
"Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr De Gucht, I would first of all like to thank the shadow rapporteurs very much for working together so constructively."
"Now that we have finally agreed on the formal aspects of the transitional regulation, I would like to make use of this debate to explain briefly some of the requirements for the future regulation."
"The new version of the regulation should have the following basic objectives: 1."
"To increase the efficiency of the system; 2."
"To develop rules that will provide for a better regulated reform process in which the involvement of the beneficiaries is guaranteed; 3."
"To ensure that the regulation gives due weight to the task of democratic control which Parliament is required to perform."
"This includes proposals from the Committee on Development."
"The new Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) should be a clearer and more transparent system."
"I would like to make three points in this respect and the first concerns the rules of origin."
"The rules of origin and the administrative procedures that accompany them are one of the main reasons why the trade preferences granted by the GSP are being underused, particularly by the least developed countries."
"In the current version of the system, the rules of origin often prevent preferences that exist on paper from having a positive impact."
"I have just come back from the Parliamentary Conference on the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Geneva and this problem was very high up on the list of issues discussed there."
"In my opinion, the EU should campaign within the WTO for the preference system to be given priority as part of its work on harmonising the rules of origin."
"My second point concerns the partner countries."
"Here I feel that it is particularly important for us to develop more straightforward criteria."
"The Gini coefficient is a good example of this type of criterion."
"As already mentioned, we need to be more flexible in order to be able to respond more effectively."
"My third point is about technical assistance."
"Preferences alone are not enough."
"We need to increase the impact of the system and improve the rate of utilisation of the GSP by providing technical assistance."
"This is all about a general improvement of the preference system as a whole."
"I would like to thank everyone involved once again for their constructive approach."
"I will be happy to continue working with the Commission on the basis of today's assurances."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"I wish to stress that the proposal tabled by the European Commission is not the reform of the 'Generalised System of Preferences' requested by the European Parliament in its resolution of 5 June 2008, but merely an extension of the current set of rules."
"This is why I share the rapporteur's view about the need to review this regulation devised in 2008 immediately, and to adapt it to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, which subsequently came into force."
"Thanks to this treaty, the European Parliament enjoys new powers in the area of trade and must have its say on the eligibility criteria, the list of beneficiary countries and the temporary withdrawal of GSP arrangements."
"A general review of the regulation will need to be carried out in the future, aimed at increasing the involvement of beneficiary countries in the reform processes which affect them, granting technical assistance to help develop their institutional capacity, as well as reviewing and harmonising the rules of origin."
"The Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) gives 176 developing countries preferential access to the EU market."
"Tariff reductions or duty-free access to the internal market enable trade to make a contribution to reducing poverty in these countries."
"Therefore, I support the transitional regulation which ensures the legal continuity of the GSP, so that this opportunity remains available to developing countries."
"Trade is also an important and efficient tool which gives the countries affected the chance to move closer towards the rule of law and democracy and to develop a well-functioning economy."
"Given the importance and the urgency of this issue, I am in favour of an extension and of making rapid progress with the regulation."
"One-minute speeches (Rule 150)"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(RO) Mr President, there has been much discussion in this Parliament recently about the inadequate operation of the food supply chain in Europe and a report has even been approved on this subject."
"I will give you some examples published today in Romania of the customs prices for intra-Community imports, compared with their prices on the store shelf."
"Potatoes are imported at an average price of 15 eurocents per kilogram and reach the store shelf at 80 cents per kilogram."
"Sugar is purchased for 50 eurocents and reaches the store shelf at EUR 1.15."
"Poultry meat is purchased at EUR 1.25 and sold in stores at an average price of EUR 2.10 per kilogram."
"The same newspaper which published these statistics showed that the price of potatoes rose by 45% last year, whereas the price of gold increased only by 40%."
"This absurd situation must be stopped and I believe that the European Commission and European Parliament need to seek solutions to this."
"(RO) Mr President, the number of areas in the world affected by climate change or natural disasters is steadily increasing."
"The most recent example is the tragic situation in Japan."
"The European Union's common agricultural policy must respond to these challenges, not to mention guarantee food security, as a global strategic problem."
"The growth in population size creates the need for a larger volume of food, but we have an ever-growing shortage, based on the available supply."
"Since the right to food is a basic right, food security is and must remain one of the European Union's priorities."
"The strategies implemented as part of the common agricultural policy must be backed up by an appropriate budget which will meet these challenges."
"I think that the budget allocated to the common agricultural policy must remain at least at its current level or even be adapted to accommodate the new increased needs resulting from these natural disasters, which have no respect for borders or nationality, but only perhaps for geographical area."
"Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to stress the importance of the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, since they cause almost 2 million deaths per year in all 27 Member States."
"In some countries, like my country, Romania, this amounts to 50% of all deaths."
"The treatment of such chronic diseases also represents a significant financial burden for healthcare systems, estimated at some EUR 92 billion a year for the whole EU."
"We need to make further efforts to promote healthy lifestyles and raise awareness of cardiovascular diseases."
"We, as Members of the European Parliament, should communicate better with citizens on the dangers of alcohol abuse, unhealthy diets and lack of physical activity."
"This is the only way can manage to lower the incidence of cardiovascular diseases amongst EU citizens, and hence the negative impact on national health budgets."
"(ES) Mr President, the serious accident at the Fukushima nuclear plant has called into question the supposed renaissance of nuclear energy."
"For years, a large-scale media campaign has been trying to push the belief that nuclear energy was the only solution to the energy supply and climate change problems threatening our future."
"Nothing could be further from the truth."
"To date, the four fundamental problems of nuclear energy - high costs, safety, waste and the risk of proliferation - that already led to its failure in the 1980s have yet to be satisfactorily solved."
"For all the above reasons, it is necessary to enter a phase of progressive closure and dismantling of nuclear plants, starting with those that have already had serious accidents, such as the Vandellós II plant in Catalonia and those that are nearing the end of their useful life."
"At the same time, we must increase energy efficiency, responsible energy consumption and investment in renewal energy sources."
"(PT) Mr President, the European Union's policies are threatening social and labour rights, leading to protests and conflicts."
"That is what happened last weekend in Portugal."
"Around 300 000 workers took part in the demonstration, organised by the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (CGTP)."
"It was a sea of people, indignation and revolt that flooded the streets of Lisbon, coming from all corners of Portugal."
"It was a national response of organised struggle, demonstrating that workers, women, young people and retired people are tired of being the victims of policies dictated by the interests of large, national and European economic and financial groups."
"They are determined to fight for another policy, in which the crisis is not a pretext for more unemployment, less job security, more frozen salaries and pensions, further cuts to low salaries and benefits, and for increased prices and taxes for those who live off the fruits of their labour."
"It was a 'no' to the Stability and Growth Pact and the capitalist policies that the European Union and the governments have been promoting without ever taking anything from capital, whilst facilitating increases to its income and profits."
"It is a struggle for which we feel combative and committed solidarity."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that none of us has any doubt, we have had enough: as far as Turkey is concerned, the European Union must stop talking and take action."
"The arrest of the orthodox Christian patriarch that took place on Christmas Day because he was celebrating Mass in a church in the occupied part of Cyprus was not enough, and neither was the arrest of nine journalists on 3 March enough to persuade Baroness Ashton to take action over Turkey in agreement with President Van Rompuy."
"Now, however, I do not think that even they are in any more doubt following the arrest of four members of the European Parliament and a bishop representing orthodox Christians in the European Union by Turkish security forces in the occupied part of Cyprus."
"We clearly cannot continue to take slaps in the face from Turkey; simply stopping the procedures for EU membership is not enough as a counter-measure."
"We must have the courage and strength to make it clear to that government once and for all that either it must comply with the observance of treaties, human and civil rights and freedoms, or the European Union must have the courage to break off all diplomatic and trade ties."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, less than two weeks ago, on 11 and 12 March, the presidium of the Jobbik Movement for a Better Hungary held transferred meetings in Transylvania, Székely Land and Târgu Mureş."
"Besides stating our belief in the importance of Székely territorial autonomy, we announced the Central European, European Platform, which would represent a great step towards Romanian-Hungarian reconciliation."
"As for me, after the presidium meeting I visited the Érmellék area of Partium."
"I gave a lecture in Valea lui Mihai, where the desire of the approximately 3 to 400 000 Hungarians living in Partium to preserve their identity as Hungarians and have their children educated in the Hungarian language showed itself with elemental force."
"They want autonomy."
"This concerns so many people that I would like to ask Parliament to find an occasion where we could schedule a sitting, an agenda item, where we could discuss the matter of the autonomy of both Székely Land and Érmellék."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in commemoration of the revolution and war of independence of 1848-49, Hungarians all over the world celebrated their national holiday on 15 March."
"Our poet of world renown, Sándor Petőfi, gave his life for freedom in 1849."
"On 20 March, the anniversary of his death, we commemorated another great figure of the war of independence, Governor Lajos Kossuth, father of Hungarian parliamentary democracy, who spent half of his life in foreign exile."
"It is a symbolic testimony to our people's love of freedom that our two national radio stations bear the very names of Lajos Kossuth and Sándor Petőfi."
"In one of his outstanding poems, our freedom-fighter and poet honours the memory of those heroes ""Who died for you, sacred world freedom!”"
"It was this revolutionary spirit of world freedom that infused young Hungarians back in that day, and it is this spirit in which a freedom-loving Europe is standing up for revolutionary Arab youths and for all peoples of the world who are fighting for freedom."
"(RO) Mr President, the Romanian Government has adopted, by establishing liability, a new Labour Code which infringes Romanians' right to social protection."
"The reason given for this new code is the need to make the market flexible and create new jobs."
"However, no one, neither trade unions nor employers, has asked for this amendment to be made to the old code."
"They even disagree with the new measures."
"The reality is that the Labour Code promoted by the government is not aimed at introducing flexibility, but at strongly politicising the public sector and striking a hard blow against employees through provisions such as getting rid of collective labour agreements and trade unions' rights, as well as making collective redundancies without any compensation payments."
"This means that the government is victimising the very people who are working and supporting, through their work, the desperate efforts to overcome the crisis."
"(BG) Mr President, a good idea was discussed a few days ago in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs about improving the mechanism for assessing the countries in the Schengen area in terms of how they apply the Schengen acquis, as well as the progress made by the countries applying to join the Schengen area."
"However, the criteria must be clear and apply to all, and not get confused with abstract, moralistic criteria or become politicised."
"For instance, the levels of corruption must be monitored for candidate countries."
"It is very important for corruption to be sought out and exposed, but it may be difficult for this process to be carried out objectively in each country separately."
"In other words, we should not allow any subjectivity when we are trying to improve the assessment mechanism."
"This is why sanctions are also provided for."
"Some of them may be of a financial nature. A great deal of precision is required."
"Therefore, candidate countries must prepare themselves thoroughly, otherwise, they face the threat of delay."
"Those countries which are in the Schengen area but have failed the assessment need to be aware that their membership may be frozen in keeping with the sanctions."
"- (SK) Mr President, much time has passed since the Second World War, but surely not enough for us to forget all the horrors of that period."
"I therefore cannot understand how there can be people in Europe today constructing memorials to fascist criminals."
"On 14 March, a community club of some kind in Košice unveiled a bust of János Esterházy - a war criminal condemned to death in 1947 for collaborating with fascism."
"They unveiled a bust of a criminal who welcomed the fascist troops invading Košice."
"He openly proclaimed collaboration with the Nazis, declaring, and I quote: 'I have had anti-Jewish beliefs from a very young age, and I will have them to my dying day.'"
"Ladies and gentlemen, this blatant provocation is, in my view, all the more unfortunate for the fact that this celebration of a military war criminal included a speech from the Hungarian consul - a diplomat of the country now holding the Presidency and speaking in many forums on behalf of all of us, and also on behalf of the entire EU."
"(BG) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking the floor so that I can draw your attention to a complex problem which unfortunately affects every single Bulgarian citizen, namely, the daily racketeering which the banks engage in against consumers."
"It is ridiculous that some banks in Bulgaria make charges when money is both deposited and withdrawn."
"I recently fell victim to the insane pressure exerted by banks and had funds illegally frozen in my account."
"It transpired with this incident that I did not have any legal grounds for making a protest."
"Legislation is not strictly regulated."
"Due to strong lobbying from the banking sector or the weak show of political will, it turns out that the government does not get involved in the bilateral contract between the customer and bank."
"Everyone can also clearly see the lack of equality between the partners in this contract."
"The problem, as far as I see it, is that competition has not created acceptable market conditions and I think that the government needs to get involved."
"I call for the quicker introduction of SEPA and for creating a clear framework for controlling the banks."
"I hope that the banks will then pay more attention to their customers and look after them better because, at the moment, they are simply a daily target for racketeering."
"Mr President, we were discussing consumer rights earlier on."
"One right which EU consumers are entitled to is that of food security and safety."
"They expect food coming into the European Union to be produced according to the same high standards as food produced internally."
"Unfortunately, that cannot be guaranteed."
"No lesser authority than the European Court of Auditors said recently that 'certain standards, mainly on animal welfare, imposed on EU farmers cannot be imposed on producers of imported meat'."
"That is a damning indictment, especially as it also points out that as little as 2% of food coming in can actually be tested, in marked contrast to the situation within Europe where every animal is traceable from farm to fork."
"In view of that, it seems foolhardy to be pursuing a Mercosur agreement, especially as the Swedish Institute for Food and Technology pointed out that the carbon footprint of Brazilian beef can be 35 times higher than that of Irish beef."
"(ES) Mr President, many experts are saying that the next crisis could be an energy crisis and that, moreover, we are not doing what is necessary to prevent it or that we are not doing it fast enough to prevent it."
"The World Wide Fund for Nature is calling for all of us to make a small gesture toward sustainability this Saturday."
"Many Europeans will turn out their lights for an hour and many public administrations too."
"That is not enough."
"Europe cannot remain dependent on energy sources that do not belong to it and are far away, or on unsecure energy sources."
"We must help the Member States to build an energy model in which renewable energy sources are the heart of the new mix."
"We must also help to raise awareness of new patterns of consumption because, without any doubt, renewable energy and efficiency are the keys to future sustainability."
"Finally, I should like to call on all the Member States of the Union to join the call, the desire of five Member States - including Spain - to reduce CO2 emissions by a further 30%."
"That way we would demonstrate that Europe, as well as being a leader in terms of freedom and rights, is also a leader in terms of its commitment to the planet's sustainability."
"Mr President, I am sorry to inform you at this late hour that this afternoon a group of Estonian cyclists were kidnapped by armed men in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley."
"The Estonians had crossed into Lebanon from Syria earlier in the day and were intercepted at about 17.30 by armed men in three vehicles with no licence plates."
"There is no information at the moment as to who kidnapped the cyclists or whether the incident was politically motivated."
"However, the Bekaa Valley is a stronghold of the Islamist Hezbollah movement."
"I would like to plead with Baroness Ashton, despite her constant and necessary involvement in Libya, to help resolve the situation."
"It is a challenge for the established European External Action Service to provide for smaller Member States to help the citizens of the EU in distressing situations such as this."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are currently 30 million blind and visually impaired people living in Europe."
"Have you ever thought about how they must face unresolved situations even while on a common shopping errand?"
"In many cases they are unable to determine the nature of a product by holding a simple box or bottle in their hands."
"If they take it off the shelf, they do not know what they are holding in their hands, even though without a doubt they, too, have the right to lead independent and safe lives."
"Therefore together with five of my fellow Members from four groups I would like to encourage you to urge manufacturers of industrial products to affix Braille labels to their containers on a voluntary basis."
"I would also like to ask my fellow Members to support with their signatures Declaration 14/2011, which deals with this issue."
"(HU) Mr President, in rivalries, the parties involved have always found people to blame, whom they declared responsible for the injuries suffered."
"I would like to draw your attention to one such case."
"Count János Esterházy was interned at the end of World War II, first by the Nazis and then, during the communist occupation, by the Soviets as well."
"In the Czech Republic and Slovakia he is still regarded as a war criminal, while, Mr Paška, the Russian Supreme Court already annulled his sentence in 1993, and the Polish head of state awarded him the prestigious Polonia Restituta Order two years ago on this very day."
"Esterházy assisted in the escape of hundreds of Jews, Czechs, Slovaks and Poles, and he was the only member of the Slovak parliament, Mr Paška, who voted and raised his voice against the anti-Jewish laws in 1942."
"The joint building of a united Europe could begin after the ruins of World War II had been cleaned up, which included the rehabilitation of personages such as Esterházy."
"It is up to us to clean up the remaining ruins."
"(PL) Mr President, in order to say that a given country meets the requirements for a mature democracy, it is not enough to say that elections to representative bodies, including and in particular the parliament, are held there in line with the principles of universality, secrecy, equality and fairness."
"It is also essential to be able to say that the rights of minorities are respected in the country."
"I think that the Chamber in which we are holding our debates today is the most appropriate place to remind Members of the fact that on 17 March the Parliament of the Republic of Lithuania amended its Education Act."
"In its amended form, the Act unfortunately appears to use administrative methods to violate the rights of minorities, including the Polish minority in this instance, by endeavouring to assimilate people who belong to the Polish minority under duress which is, as it were, imposed by the state."
"Suffice it to say that the Education Act means an identical teaching programme will be imposed on all schools, including those where the only pupils are those from national minorities."
"It increases the number of compulsory subjects taught in Lithuanian."
"Under the pretext of 'optimisation of the school network', national minority schools, including Polish schools, are to be closed in small towns, and only Lithuanian schools are to remain there."
"The Act violates international conventions ratified by Lithuania."
"It is worth noting that various individuals have spoken about this matter many times."
"I think that the European Parliament is the appropriate forum to speak out about such matters, and to call for the fundamental rights of national minorities to be respected."
"That concludes this item."
"EU relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Baudis, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on European Union relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, first of all I should like to stress that this report is the outcome of very constructive work with the political groups and I wish personally to thank Mr Howitt, Mrs Brepoels and Mrs Brantner, as well as Mrs Jäätteenmäki, for their collaboration."
"As you know, this report relates to the overall strategy in relations between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council."
"Our work started several months ago, so before the events that are now taking place in the Arab world."
"Since then, we have observed everywhere - including in the Gulf - powerful demonstrations, which are taking place to ask for greater respect of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy."
"However, right at the beginning of our work, even before the events began, the report - and the amendments adopted in committee - raised all the issues that are behind the uprising."
"We condemn all forms of discrimination - including those founded on gender or religion - we highlight the issues relating to labour law, social and trade union rights, freedom of conscience, freedom of expression and of opinion, women's rights, the need to reform the justice system, the abolition of the death penalty and of mutilating sentences, and political rights."
"As the events in Bahrain have unfolded, and faced with the repression of demonstrations, as well as the military intervention of neighbouring countries, members of the GCC, we have prepared, with the shadow rapporteurs, a series of oral amendments that offer support to the demonstrators fighting for freedom."
"We have highlighted the legitimacy of their demands and condemned the violent reaction by the Bahraini authorities as well as the military intervention of GCC countries that came to take part in the repression, and we express our grave concern in respect of the violent response of those in power."
"Finally we offer our full support to the process of democratic transition."
"Obviously, this report also outlines long-term strategic prospects."
"It touches on the potential of a partnership in many areas (geopolitics, energy, education and science and in the area of regional integration)."
"From a geopolitical point of view, Iran clearly represents a genuine threat."
"Between Iran and Israel, the Gulf States would inevitably be the collateral victims of a conflict."
"These countries expect a lot from us in trying to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons."
"The GCC countries, which make up a quarter of Arab League member states, play a very important role in the peace process."
"Let us remember that they are behind the Arab peace initiative."
"With regard to energy, the GCC is the European Union's leading oil supplier, so the EU is highly dependent on these countries, but their oil reserves are dwindling and they are preparing their transition thanks to the development of renewable energy."
"We can offer our experience in this area."
"On an educational and scientific level, these countries are making education one of their priorities."
"Because of the limited number of universities and lecturers, we are seeing units of prestigious American universities being set up."
"Unfortunately, the European Union, although committed, is very much lagging behind the United States."
"For example, only eight students from GCC countries came to Europe last year as part of the Erasmus Mundus programme."
"Finally, in the area of regional integration, the GCC is slow to make progress."
"Wiser for its experience, the European Union can offer its help, advice and know-how; finally, we call for the signing of a free trade agreement which has been in negotiation for over 20 years."
"- (SK) Mr President, the states of the Persian Gulf have significant economic potential, offering broad possibilities for greater cooperation with the EU."
"The Gulf Cooperation Council, just like the European Union, has a serious interest in improving commercial cooperation, which therefore depends on our ability to communicate cooperation priorities to Gulf state representatives."
"Our views are close on many issues regarding the economic management of international security or the fight against terrorism, and it would therefore be a pity to limit potential cooperation only to the commercial and economic sphere."
"It is surely clear to us all that our current cooperation with the Gulf states has considerable potential for growth, and the drafting of a new, more ambitious plan for EU policy in the Gulf Cooperation Council and its member states might, along with trade improvements from economic cooperation, also bring a closer partnership with representatives of the moderate Islamic world, which, in difficult times, might be a worthwhile interesting political bonus from this activity."
"(HU) Mr President, personally, I too am in favour of a free trade agreement coming into effect between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council."
"The region could become an important strategic partner for the European Union with regard to commerce, including an increased oil supply."
"I believe it is essential that we strengthen economic relations."
"In order to ensure the competitiveness of the European Union, we must find additional new markets and new partners, whereas in areas where the European Union already plays a substantial part, our priority is the official reinforcement of relations."
"The successful conclusion of the negotiation process which has been going on for twenty years requires a constructive yet flexible approach from both parties, so that the current, rather rigid positions can be approximated."
"If we seriously believe that the European Union must be able to compete with the United States, China and India, it is essential that we also penetrate various economic areas and market segments where other major powers may already have seized predominance, and that we focus on our existing market priorities and increase their importance."
"(RO) Mr President, first of all, I too would like to congratulate Mr Baudis for this report."
"Parliament therefore supports the resumption of negotiations between the EU and Gulf Cooperation Council at a critical time."
"The events in Bahrain indicate that political dialogue between both international organisations needs to be stepped up."
"Indeed, I think that the six Arab states can initiate peaceful change in society by improving the human rights situation."
"On the other hand, the EU's oil supply is affected by the events in the Mediterranean region."
"In this situation, cooperation between the Union and Council is vital for guaranteeing energy requirements and avoiding a rise in the oil price on the global market."
"I also think that it is time to conclude the 20 years of negotiations by signing the Free Trade Agreement, which would be so beneficial to both sides."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, we are here this evening to discuss this Parliament's reports on the Gulf Cooperation Council."
"I understand that some political groups would have preferred to have postponed the discussion so as to better reflect the strategic times the Arab world is going through."
"Indeed, at the time you started drafting no-one could have guessed what the world would be like today, nor what challenges the countries and people of the entire Arab region would be facing."
"In line with our conviction that each country is different from the others, the European Union is responding to different situations with different adapted responses."
"You heard Cathy Ashton yesterday on all these: whether Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen or Bahrain, the European Union is faced with many critical choices and decisions."
"The report we are discussing this evening is focused on the Gulf Cooperation Council and its countries, some of which are also experiencing calls from their populations to take better account of their political, social and economic aspirations."
"Gulf governments are responding in different ways: substantial financial packages to alleviate the most pressing and social needs, announcements for political reforms, ceding some legislative powers to elected bodies, or openness to comprehensive and inclusive national dialogues."
"But we have also seen violence."
"Within the limits of our discussion tonight this is especially true of Bahrain."
"We have been following this closely; Cathy Ashton has repeatedly stated her concern at reports of serious violence on the streets and at the signs of increasing sectarian tensions."
"She has also called on the security forces present in the country to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"She has raised her voice many times in calling for dialogue as the only way forward."
"All of this has been done using a mix of public statements, which you have seen, and direct contacts with the authorities concerned."
"The question for us is: where does all this lead to?"
"What should the EU do?"
"How should we read your report against the backdrop of these events?"
"Yesterday Cathy Ashton noted she preferred engagement to isolation and I share that view."
"Your report calls for more contacts and not less and I agree."
"As trade Commissioner I would welcome better opportunities for exchanges between businesspeople."
"This is a time for us Europeans to stand ready to foster more contacts with the populations of the Gulf countries."
"It is also time for us Europeans to stand ready to respond positively to any request we may get for Europe to facilitate unprecedented dialogue leading to reforms."
"We should not shy away from defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, but we should not dictate or impose our models of democracy on others either."
"Europe firmly believes that reforms must come from within."
"I believe this is right also with the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council."
"It is not for me to tell this Parliament how to go about dealing with the report before it."
"What I believe is that we need to think in strategic terms, and for that dialogues and engagements are essential."
"The EU should stand ready to lend all its support to dialogue and reform processes in the region."
"We are ready to provide political support to reform, and also know-how and expertise to address more specific issues."
"We welcome any such opportunity but this can only happen if and when the countries in the region ask for our assistance."
"One final word on the free trade area with the Gulf for which I am directly responsible."
"I trust that when the right circumstances on the ground materialise we will be able to proceed on the basis of a common EU determination to further trade relationship objectives in relation to the Gulf Cooperation Council."
"Needless to say stability is a necessary condition both for the political contacts between governments and citizens to be enforced, and for trade flows and business to operate effectively."
"Thank you for your attention and I would more specifically thank the rapporteur, Mr Baudis."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"I believe that it is absolutely vital for the EU to formulate a more ambitious policy in respect of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and its member states, particularly at a time when the European Union is exiting an economic crisis and in view of the disasters - an earthquake together with a tsunami - which have hit Japan."
"I am pleased that the report covers issues such as energy in its broadest sense, industry, scientific research and the development of education."
"The European External Action Service should therefore allocate more employees and increase the number of diplomatic missions open in GCC countries, in order to bring about closer cooperation."
"I also believe that we should welcome all efforts undertaken as part of free trade negotiations to guarantee safe and secure supplies of raw materials."
"Cooperation between the EU and the GCC should encompass further support for exchange programmes involving students, scientists and professionals."
"In its report, the European Parliament stresses that the conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and the GCC is a priority for further cooperation with our Mediterranean partners."
"The European Union should therefore develop an appropriate strategy to support the process of regional integration."
"in writing. - (DE) It seems that the people of the six states in the Gulf Cooperation Council, which incidentally are the EU's most important trading partners in the Arab world, do not believe that the reforms that have been taking place there over recent years are adequate."
"It is not yet clear to what extent the plans to inject huge sums of money to support the economies and improve social conditions in the two poorest of the six member states could help to bring an end to the ongoing demonstrations."
"Although the Gulf Cooperation Council disputes the legitimacy of Colonel Gaddafi and supports the idea of a no-fly zone, demonstrators have been fired on in Saudi Arabia, which is also a member state, and in Bahrain demonstrators have also been subjected to violent treatment."
"Even the sending of special units by the Gulf Cooperation Council to protect important infrastructure facilities in Bahrain is controversial, because the Shiite opposition is calling on the international community to protect the people from military intervention."
"It seems as if the introduction of a no-fly zone has opened up a Pandora's box."
"The EU must not allow itself to be dragged into the internal affairs of states in the Middle East and that is what is threatening to happen, because the balance in Bahrain could change very rapidly."
"We have seen what agreements are worth after a coup in the case of the readmission agreements."
"Therefore, we should wait to see how the situation develops instead of pressing ahead now."
"I welcome the adoption of the Baudis report as, now more than ever, the European Union needs to have a coherent strategy in its relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)."
"Firstly, the member states of this organisation have a growing influence on the Arab-Muslim world and can play an important role in intercultural dialogue."
"Furthermore, I believe that specific measures need to be taken to raise the Union's profile in this region and promote mutual understanding."
"Ways for doing this include establishing cooperation in the press and audiovisual sector, so as to remedy the lack of information about Europe."
"Finally, I believe that the recent events in Bahrain force us to base the Union's relations with the GCC more firmly on respect for human rights and basic freedoms."
"At the moment, we need to ensure that the demonstrators' calls for democratic reforms are heard as part of a genuine political dialogue."
"The way to resolve the recent conflicts in Bahrain, for example, is by engaging civil society and not by using violent repression."
"A free trade agreement means fewer barriers to mutual cooperation and trade."
"I therefore support such an agreement, in principle."
"The states belonging to the Gulf Cooperation Council are undoubtedly important trading partners, particularly because they possess the basic raw material of our age - oil."
"I also welcomed the fact that the report, in addition to trade, also mentions the shortcomings of our trading partners in the area of human rights."
"Despite this, however, I hesitated for a long time over whether to vote for the report."
"Some of the states represented in the Gulf Cooperation Council have two faces."
"One face smiles at us in a friendly way and says it is our ally in the fight against Islamic terrorism."
"The other, however, is less visible and devotes billions of dollars every year to the spreading of religious 'education' which calls for violence against Christians, Jews and all non-Muslims."
"Eventually, however, I voted in favour of the report, because I also expect the Commission to tell us who is providing financial support for this hatred, when it begins detailed monitoring of manifestations of violence against Christians in Islamic states."

"EU-US air transport agreement - EU-Canada air transport agreement - EU-Vietnam air services agreement (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the recommendation by Mr Zasada, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the draft decision by Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council on the conclusion of the Protocol to Amend the Air Transport Agreement between the United States of America, of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part (15381/2010 - C7-0385/2010 - 2010/0112(NLE)),"
"the recommendation by Mrs Ticău, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the draft decision of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council on the conclusion of the Agreement on Air Transport between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and Canada, of the other part (15380/2010 - C7-0386/2010 - 2009/0018(NLE)), and"
"the recommendation by Mr Riquet, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on certain aspects of air services (14876/2010 - C7-0366/2010 - 2007/0082(NLE))."
"Madam President, the Protocol which will be put to the vote is a particularly important document."
"The aviation markets of the European Union and the United States, taken together, account for around 60% of world air traffic."
"Opening the market to airlines from the European Union and the United States on a non-discriminatory basis will offer passengers and freight operators improved services, provide substantial economic benefits and create jobs."
"My dream is for passengers to benefit from competition between airlines on the basis of market principles, for passengers flying in transit to the United States to pass through one security point, for passengers in the European Union and the United States to enjoy the same rights, and, of course, for them to be aware of these rights."
"Will this Protocol guarantee these things?"
"No."
"Yet I am convinced that it is a step in the right direction, and that it will make it significantly easier in the future to achieve these goals."
"During the successive rounds of negotiations between the EU and the United States, it was touch and go several times whether the Protocol would be signed."
"Finally, however, we succeeded in adopting it."
"As a result, a number of risks were avoided, including the greatest risk of all, namely that the suspension clause would be triggered, which would have resulted in the suspension of the agreement and the annulment of the results of both stages of negotiations."
"This would have meant a return to the legal situation as it stood seven years ago, which would be unacceptable."
"Six of the EU Member States have no bilateral air transport agreements with the United States, and rejection of the document would have meant preventing these Member States from being able to operate flight connections between their airports and US territory."
"The second stage of the agreement does not achieve the ultimate objective of a complete opening of the market without any restrictions on either side, but it does contain a number of incentives to encourage reform."
"In particular, when the US changes its legislation to allow EU investors majority ownership of US airlines, the EU will allow the same for US investors."
"I am particularly pleased by the fact that the significance of the agreement's social dimension is emphasised."
"In this context, the Commission should utilise the agreement to promote compliance with the appropriate international regulations on social rights, in particular with the employment standards set out in the conventions of the International Labour Organisation and the OECD, and with the Rome Convention."
"This will ensure better observance of existing employee rights by airlines."
"The agreement will also strengthen cooperation on environmental matters by requiring compatibility and interaction in the field of green technologies and fuel and air traffic management."
"In my capacity as rapporteur, I endeavoured to place the issue in a broader context and present both the positive and the negative features of the Protocol, without succumbing to the temptation to concentrate exclusively on its weak or strong points."
"I did not start work with the a priori assumption that we must support or reject this Protocol."
"Following a great many meetings and discussions, I came to the conclusion that the EU will benefit much more from adopting this document than from rejecting it."
"rapporteur. - (RO) Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, extended the circumstances in which Parliament's consent was required for the conclusion of international agreements."
"Air transport agreements now fall within this category because they cover a field which the ordinary legislative procedure applies to."
"Prior to the current agreement, aviation was the subject of bilateral agreements with 19 of the EU Member States."
"I am referring by this to the agreements between the European Union and Canada."
"Many of these agreements contained numerous restrictions and did not offer full access to the respective markets."
"In November 2002, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that certain provisions in these bilateral agreements were incompatible with Community law."
"The negotiating mandate sets the objective of establishing an open aviation area between the European Union and Canada."
"This would create a single market for air transport between the European Union and Canada where investment could flow freely and where European and Canadian airlines would be able to provide air services without any restriction, including in the domestic markets of both parties."
"The EU-Canada Air Transport Agreement was initialled on 30 November 2008, endorsed by the EU-Canada summit on 6 May 2009 and signed on 17-18 December 2009."
"What is the content of the agreement?"
"The agreement includes a gradual phasing-in of traffic rights and investment opportunities, as well as far-reaching cooperation on a number of issues including safety, security, social matters, consumer interests, the environment, air traffic management, state aid and competition."
"All European Union airlines will be able to operate direct flights to Canada from anywhere in Europe."
"The agreement removes all restrictions on routes, prices or the number of weekly flights between Canada and the European Union."
"Airlines are free to enter into commercial arrangements such as code-share agreements, which are important for airlines serving a large number of destinations, and to set their fares in line with competition law."
"The agreement contains provisions for opening the market in phases."
"Phase one applies where the foreign ownership of airlines is limited to 25%, as was the case when the negotiations on the agreement were completed."
"Phase two starts as soon as Canada has taken the necessary steps to enable European investors to own up to 49% of Canadian carriers' voting equity."
"Phase three begins once both sides introduce the possibility for investors to set up and control new airlines in each others' markets."
"Phase four is the final step with full rights to operate between, within and beyond both markets, including between places in the territory of the other party."
"I am referring here to cabotage."
"I would like to mention a few points about this report."
"Although this agreement is more ambitious than that with the US regarding market access, it is less explicit when it comes to recognising the importance of the social dimension."
"It is important that the Commission uses the agreement and, in particular, the possibility of reference to the Joint Committee, to promote compliance with relevant international legislation on social rights, especially the labour standards embodied in the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organisation."
"Given the important role played by the Joint Committee, including in politically sensitive matters such as environmental and labour standards, it is important that the Commission ensures that Parliament is kept fully informed and consulted about the Committee's work and also about future amendments to the Treaty."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, I shall be very brief, not because the Agreement with Vietnam is any less important, but because Mrs Ticău has reiterated, in the previous report on Canada, the legislative and regulatory framework within which these air agreements between the European Union and a third country will apply."
"The context is therefore exactly the same as this one except that our agreement, which is simpler and less ambitious, seeks to regularise horizontally, in the area of air services, the 17 bilateral agreements that previously existed between Vietnam and the countries of Europe, and naturally to extend them to all EU countries."
"This agreement does not relate to the opening-up of the market because Vietnam's economy is a regulated State economy and there is obviously no question of opening up the market."
"The aim is therefore - as the previous rapporteur has already said - to bring into line with European legislation the existing bilateral agreements on air services that have been concluded up to now between the European Union and Vietnam."
"One of the main characteristics of this Agreement is a designation clause relating to all EU air carriers."
"This will give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and Vietnam."
"This Agreement also includes safety provisions designed to standardise and equalise these kinds of provision, in addition to a clause against anticompetitive practices."
"We have come up against several difficulties, which explains why it has taken some time to reach this Agreement - several years in fact."
"As for the inclusion of a fuel taxation clause, this was eventually rejected by Vietnam."
"This clause, which generally features in air agreements negotiated by the Commission, allows for the taxation of a third-country carrier when it operates a flight within the EU."
"It should be stated, of course, that Vietnam does not operate nor will operate for the time being any flights within the European Union."
"Furthermore, the Vietnamese Government has promised to enter into bilateral negotiations with Member States if this proves necessary or if, indeed, a Vietnamese national airline were to schedule a flight within the European Union."
"To conclude, the ratification of the Agreement evidently offers more advantages than does the absence of such an Agreement even though it lacks a fuel taxation clause."
"It will, however, ensure that the principles of EU law are respected bilaterally and in the case of all EU Member States."
"We therefore obviously call on the European Parliament to ratify this Agreement."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank Parliament and the rapporteurs in particular for supporting the Commission on these important agreements."
"All three have been strongly supported by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"On the US agreement, let me start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Zasada, for his very positive recommendation in relation to the outcome of the negotiations with the United States on a second stage air services agreement."
"You will remember that the aim of the second stage discussions was to facilitate the normalisation of the transatlantic market and extend the scope and depth of the excellent aviation relationship established through the implementation of the first stage agreement, in place since March 2008."
"I now want to mention the key elements of the second stage aviation agreement."
"The second stage agreement creates the prospects for additional investment and market access opportunities."
"It also further strengthens the framework of cooperation on the environment, social protection, competition and security."
"On the environment, the agreement establishes a clear framework for tackling local and global challenges."
"The agreement seeks to reduce the security burden on passengers, airlines and airports across Europe."
"For the first time in such an aviation agreement, the need to balance market access opportunities with strong social protection has been recognised through a commitment to implementing the provisions of the agreement in a way which does not undermine labour rights."
"On the commercial front, Europe has gained further rights, including immediate access to the 'Fly America' programme with the exception of defence."
"The second stage agreement is not perfect."
"Like you, I would have liked to have seen an immediate and irrevocable change to the US laws governing ownership and control of its airlines."
"This has not been possible, but we were able to secure a commitment from the United States to work towards reforming these rules in the future."
"As part of the agreement, the EU and the United States have committed to the goal of removing the remaining market barriers in industry, including those that limit airlines' access to global capital."
"Let me now turn to the agreement with Canada."
"My thanks go to the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and in particular to Ms Ţicău."
"This ambitious agreement is designed to achieve complete opening of the markets for traffic rights and investment, at the same time reaching an unprecedented level of regulatory convergence and cooperation between the authorities."
"With respect to market access, the agreement comprises the full range of traffic rights and investment opportunities: this means 100% ownership and control."
"It is done through a phased market opening in four phases."
"Among its multiple benefits for both sides, it is also worth noting the establishment of a level playing field for the industry, as well as common or compatible standards for safety, security and air traffic management."
"Last but not least, I am convinced that by removing existing regulatory restrictions this agreement will lead to a substantial increase in passengers and generate various consumer benefits and the creation of new jobs."
"On Vietnam, let me also start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Riquet, for his support for this horizontal agreement."
"Currently, we have negotiated 45 such horizontal agreements with partner countries worldwide."
"On 4 October 2010, during a visit to the European Union, the Vietnamese Prime Minister signed the agreement, which represents an important step towards strengthening aviation relations between the EU and Vietnam."
"The horizontal agreement will restore legal certainty to our aviation relations with Vietnam by bringing the bilateral air services agreements between 17 Member States and Vietnam into line with EU law."
"Most importantly, it will remove nationality restrictions in bilateral air services agreements between EU Member States and Vietnam."
"It will thereby allow any EU airline to benefit from the existing bilateral agreements between Vietnam and the Member State."
"Thank you very much for your attention. I am looking forward to the debate."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank all the rapporteurs for their reports."
"We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) welcome these agreements."
"In this case, 27 agreements which could have been concluded in these areas are being replaced by just one."
"For us, technical harmonisation is also an important point."
"It increases levels of safety not just for the airlines themselves, but also for the passengers."
"The opening up of the market and the cooperation at a European level should be treated in the same way by both sides."
"It is important to highlight the fact that the agreement with Canada is a very good example of this, while the agreement with the USA leaves something to be desired."
"Another area which leaves something to be desired is the lack of regular checks on the social and environmental aspects of these agreements, which should be a part of all future agreements, because the simplification of the economic aspects should also enable us to use these agreements to influence not only the European market but also the global market."
"Importantly, these agreements also bring benefits for passengers, because they can result in the controls being simplified without them being neglected."
"Finally, I would like to say that we welcome this agreement, because, as I have already said, 27 agreements are ultimately being replaced by one."
"This is a clear indication that we will hopefully soon be dealing with only seven or perhaps even three airspaces, instead of with the current 27, as part of measures to improve air safety and implement the single European sky."
"This will make negotiations on these agreements much simpler."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank the three rapporteurs for the work they have done and for the helpful cooperation on their part."
"When we launch, shortly, a more general debate in response to Mr Brian Simpson's report on aviation agreements, we will get an opportunity to address more thoroughly the general approach and strategy with regard to this sort of agreement."
"We, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, emphatically support the replacement of old bilateral agreements between our Member States and third countries with comprehensive global agreements at European level."
"This is the best guarantee of a level playing field for all our airlines."
"It will also strengthen the integration of our own aviation sector as it will, of course, our negotiating position in relation to third countries."
"It is important, in that regard, that we pay attention not only to the opening up of the market for additional flying rights and suchlike, but also to a strengthening of the regulatory framework in the environmental and social fields and the fields of safety and security."
"We absolutely have to bring these into line with each other, at a very high level."
"Another important point to mention here is that, now that the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force, Parliament is not just supposed to give an opinion, but really has to approve these agreements as well."
"My message, therefore, to the Commission and the Council is that they should make full use of those powers and that Parliament, therefore, should retain its say in approving or modifying additions or other amendments at a later stage."
"With regard to the agreements before us, our group believes that the agreement with Canada comes the closest to the model that we have in mind, that is extensive cooperation in the fields of security, social issues and consumer and environmental protection."
"Indeed, the rapporteur has rightly observed that the sections on social issues should have been worded a little more strongly, but that can be resolved in the Joint Committee which will now have to make a few things concrete."
"Besides that cooperation, there is also the gradual introduction of additional flying rights and the gradual extension of the opportunity to become a shareholder in each other's airlines."
"The agreement with Vietnam also reminds us of the growing importance of the Asian market, and I think that, on this particular point, we have to point out that the Council has been dragging its heels for years over giving the Commission a mandate to negotiate with countries such as China and India."
"That mandate is essential, of course, if we are to make progress on this."
"By way of conclusion, I would like to say a few things about the agreement with the United States, particularly regarding the second stage."
"This concerns an area which covers 60% of the world aviation market and is therefore extremely important."
"I personally was a rapporteur for this House when, a few years ago, the first stage was approved."
"With regard to the United States, we are not completely satisfied because some things still have to happen in terms of market access."
"We ask the Commission to give an undertaking that this will not be the end, that it will proceed on the course of opening up the market and that we, as Parliament, will be fully involved in the activities of the Joint Committee."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, firstly I too would like to thank the rapporteur."
"We have already discussed the fact that, following the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament now has the opportunity to vote in favour of air service agreements of this kind or to reject them."
"We cannot change the contents, but we can accept or oppose them."
"This does not always make things simple, but it is at least a new task, which we are taking very seriously."
"It makes sense to replace a number of different bilateral agreements with one standardised EU agreement."
"It is clear that there are no boundaries in airspace, which is a good way of explaining this."
"The European Union is also a strong economic community and so it is sensible to discuss agreements made by the EU with different third countries, which is what we are doing now."
"We have a number of very different agreements on the table today."
"I will start with Vietnam."
"This is the least complex agreement."
"It concerns different accesses and services and also safety regulations, but it is a relatively short agreement, which is why I am only mentioning it briefly."
"The most comprehensive agreement is the one with Canada."
"In this agreement it was not just a case of ensuring free access to air services which can be used in different ways, but also of covering issues such as the environment, safety and also market access and ownership."
"In that respect we have long since passed the first stage of 25% and already reached the second stage of 49% ownership of each other's air services market."
"Now we are about to enter stages 3 and 4."
"In stage 3 it is possible to establish airlines in another country and another region."
"Stage 4 would allow a European airline to fly from A to B within Canada."
"We have not come nearly as far as this with the USA, despite the fact that we have been negotiating with the USA for a long time."
"I would like to make one more point."
"Mr Kallas said that we were all very much in support of this issue, but in the case of the USA our reaction is more restrained, because the agreement does not represent a true partnership."
"The USA wants to take more from us than it is prepared to give."
"We need to continue negotiating on this."
"Apart from this issue, we will vote in favour, because it is clear that progress has been made."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, we also welcome the successful conclusion of the second phase of the EU open skies agreement."
"Indeed, after several years it was rather overdue."
"Obviously this agreement is a significant breakthrough and it is to be welcomed."
"I acknowledge that negotiators have made huge progress in the areas of security, competition, market access and environmental cooperation."
"But, like the Commissioner, I am disappointed that this agreement did not achieve its ultimate objective of a complete opening of the market without restrictions on either side."
"The failure to resolve fully issues of foreign ownership and control (cabotage) must be addressed in future discussions if European carriers are to truly benefit."
"Of course agreements mean compromise, but that does not mean getting a deal at any price."
"The aviation industry is massively important to Europe."
"It facilitates economic growth, trade, investment and tourism."
"Air agreements with third countries offer our airlines great opportunities in foreign markets, and I therefore urge the Commission to continue to strive to conclude air agreements which are fair, robust and lead to full liberalisation, which will benefit both European carriers and consumers."
"Finally, can we just add our support to the EU-Vietnam agreement."
"Madam President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years we have concluded a large number of air service agreements, which have always involved summarising the old national agreements under a European umbrella."
"Now things are starting to change with regard to the involvement of the European Union and I think this is very important."
"The agreement with Vietnam largely follows the old model that we have always used."
"However, the agreement with Canada is more ambitious, which I welcome."
"The cooperation in the field of the environment and social issues is positive, but in my opinion it could be extended even further."
"The situation concerning the agreement with the USA is quite different."
"In this case, I believe that we have given in far too early."
"Market access is a question of fairness and in this agreement the regulations are not fair."
"Nevertheless, we have climbed down."
"To a large extent there has been a failure to cover certain aspects of social conditions."
"Much too little has been done in this area."
"We must ensure that social dumping does not take place here, because this is also a safety issue when it comes to airlines."
"We finally need to make this clear."
"My second point is that there are major problems with regard to environmental issues."
"The USA is starting to exert significant pressure to have night flight restrictions, which are in place to protect local residents, relaxed or lifted."
"The pressure in this area is enormous and I am afraid that we will have to give in."
"We must make it quite clear that this would be a disaster for everyone who lives near an airport."
"On the safety question, the USA is gradually tightening the screw and unfortunately the implementation in the European Union is going unchallenged."
"This is a mistake and I want to be very clear on this."
"Finally, I would like to mention code-sharing, which is being presented as a major achievement."
"I would like to say just one thing."
"This will ultimately restrict passengers' choices."
"I will not be able to choose which airline I fly with and I may find myself confronted with a completely different airline when I reach the gate."
"The concept of competition in the airline industry is fictitious and it is becoming even more so when it comes to the position of passengers."
"on behalf on the EFD Group. - (LT) Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, extended the circumstances in which Parliament's consent was required for the conclusion of an international agreement."
"Air agreements now fall within this category because they cover a field to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies."
"I believe that the implementation of these agreements would provide substantial economic benefits and create jobs."
"In addition, regulatory convergence could promote fair competition."
"While the second-stage Agreement represents a significant step forward, it is important for it not to be regarded as the end of the process of establishing a transatlantic aviation market."
"As for Canada, it is good that all EU airlines will be able to operate direct flights to Canada from anywhere in Europe."
"The Agreement removes all restrictions on routes, prices, or the number of weekly flights between Canada and the EU."
"The ambitious nature of this Agreement is very much to be welcomed."
"It should serve as a target for other negotiations currently underway."
"I therefore believe that Parliament should consent to the EU-Canada Air Transport Agreement."
"The same can be said for the Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam on air services."
"All of these air agreements are beneficial and necessary for the European Union, our airlines and our citizens."
"(DE) Madam President, first of all I would like to take this opportunity to thank all three rapporteurs very much for their hard work."
"These agreements are very important for air travel and, therefore, for the European Union."
"However, I would also like to take the opportunity to refer once again to the framework agreement of 20 November 2010."
"I hope that the European Parliament will be informed in an appropriate way and in good time by the Commission about negotiations on future agreements in the interests of good interinstitutional cooperation and an effective flow of information."
"We know that the negotiations on these and on other agreements are of the highest quality, but it is important for us to be aware of the strengths and weak points of the agreements after they come into force, so that we can make a better contribution."
"This will make it easier to guarantee Parliament's support for the agreements."
"(ES) Madam President, tomorrow it will be one year to the day since the second stage of the air transport agreement between the European Union and the United States was finally signed after eight rounds of difficult negotiation."
"As such, I believe we should feel satisfied - me in particular, of course - that this was accomplished under the Spanish Presidency and under the leadership of the Minister of Public Works and Transport, José Blanco, who achieved considerable progress in aviation matters, including the single sky and labour relations in the air traffic control sector, where a negotiated settlement was reached."
"I also welcome the fact that Parliament is using its new powers for the approval of such international agreements, specifically in relation to the transport industry."
"The second stage of the EU-US air transport agreement eliminates the suspension clause, which entails the need to continue making progress and improving a number of issues in relation to the environment, competition and passengers' rights, with which we are not completely satisfied as yet."
"For the first time, the agreement also addresses labour relations."
"I believe this is a matter of paramount importance, as it also enables the safeguarding of workers' rights for the first time, as well as the future applicability of International Labour Organisation and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development conventions."
"The agreement also sets out clear guidelines - and I believe this is quite significant - to build mutual trust in the area of security."
"The possibility of a one-stop system must remain open."
"We therefore believe this is a good agreement, which establishes a new non-discriminatory basis, entails improved service to the public and to companies, is economically and socially beneficial, and encourages fair competition."
"Nevertheless, it is once again not perfect, as the extent of European ambitions means we must seek to go beyond this second stage."
"We therefore need to examine and exploit all the potential that is available to us, including the Joint Committee and its new powers, as well as the new possibilities opened up at the International Civil Aviation Organisation regarding the Single European Sky ATM Research and others."
"We therefore call on Vice-President Kallas to push for this agreement, to follow it closely and, of course, to report to Parliament."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Open Skies Agreement between Europe and the United States is an advance, but it is just one stage and it faces Europe with a dilemma."
"The Committee on Transport and the Commission have themselves pointed this out."
"Either we accept an agreement that disadvantages European businesses, or we suspend the agreement and risk losing the benefits we have gained since 2008."
"So allow me to draw a parallel with the licences of professional and private pilots - a text which will be debated before the summer - because pilots, of whom I am one, face a dilemma."
"The European Aviation Safety Agency, which wants to harmonise licences throughout Europe, will do so to the detriment of the 80 to 90 000 general aviation pilots directly affected - some of whom hold only a US licence - and to the detriment - and this is the important point - of those companies and jobs connected to this activity."
"I wish to draw your attention to this project which has nothing to do with safety."
"There are 31 times fewer accidents amongst holders of US licences."
"The objectives of Basic Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 provide for the recognition of and equivalent rating of licences for which it is judged unnecessary to wait for hypothetical agreements that have been pushed back to 2014."
"Thus, I propose a very open sky agreement and even invite you to accompany me on those occasions when I come to Parliament flying my own plane, to show you that a US pilot licence is perfectly safe."
"Thank you for the invitation, Mr Boulland, I shall see what I can do."
"(RO) Madam President, I want to congratulate Mrs Ţicău on this ambitious agreement with Canada."
"The agreement marks an important phase in the process of opening the market."
"At the same time, it will help create new air routes and develop new opportunities for investors on both sides of the Atlantic, in terms of both the development of new investments and the introduction of new services for European and Canadian citizens."
"I think that the decision to allow airlines to operate without restriction anywhere in Europe and Canada is valuable and will be of benefit to consumers, airlines and the economies of both countries in general."
"The implementation of this agreement will lead to more services being operated by airlines and to new cargo transport opportunities."
"However, this development must also raise greater concern about consideration of the impact on climate change."
"The agreement will also make the European and Canadian markets safer by strengthening cooperation with regard to compliance with certification procedures and inspections aimed at guaranteeing a maximum level of safety for passengers and goods."
"Madam President, as Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with Canada, it is with particular pleasure that I speak on this EU-Canada agreement."
"I think it is very worthwhile reiterating some of the significant features of the agreement."
"As mentioned before, in Phase 1, airlines have unlimited freedom to operate direct services between any point in the EU and Canada, without limitation on the number of providers or, indeed, services."
"We move to Phase 3; we will see investors able to set up new airlines in each other's countries and, in Phase 4, full cabotage rights and the potential for 100% ownership of carriers."
"The agreement also sets out mutual standards for safety and security."
"And that is important because it means that the transfer of passengers, luggage and cargo should benefit from a more streamlined approach."
"It is an important agreement for the EU and our aviation sector."
"It will allow increased competition, greater choice for the travelling public."
"Not only that, I believe that the comprehensive nature of this agreement can serve as a benchmark for future agreements with other countries."
"This resolution clearly demonstrates Canada's position as our most proactive international partner, and I wholeheartedly support it."
"(PT) Madam President, these agreements are part of the liberalisation process that is currently underway in the air transport sector."
"They are clearly marked by ideology."
"Even in this strategic sector, the aim is to cripple state intervention and regulation, opening the doors to the monopolistic concentration that always results from free competition, which is considered sacrosanct."
"Under the pretext of facilitating business opportunities within international air transport, this promotes the interests of multinationals within the sector at the expense of national companies and their respective strategic interests, including those that, as is the case in Portugal with TAP, are publicly owned."
"This means that both the workers and the passengers lose out."
"Workers lose out because liberalisation facilitates dumping by multinationals, leading to work-related insecurity due to the forced deterioration of working conditions."
"Passengers also lose out because, among other things, aeronautical safety will tend to be left to the whim of cost/benefit considerations by companies."
"This is nothing new."
"The situation in other sectors such as rail transport, which has seen increased liberalisation, amply demonstrates the consequences of putting the tenets of the free market into practice."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank the honourable Members very much for their comments."
"Of course the most complicated issue is the agreement and negotiation process with the United States."
"I can assure you that this is far from being the end."
"It is one part of the process and we are definitely continuing to negotiate with the United States but I would like to underline that the United States is a very difficult partner."
"As many of you mentioned, 60% of world aviation is covered by the EU and the United States."
"What we decide in cooperation will also define the whole framework and whole environment for aviation in the world, so the cooperation is also extremely important for the whole world."
"It also must be made very clear that the Americans have the same parliamentary procedures: they have the US Congress, which is very difficult to deal with precisely because of protectionist feeling, but we are working together and developing our relations."
"I will be going to Washington in a few weeks' time, and we have committed ourselves to work in five directions: first safety, second security, third technological cooperation - we signed an important agreement in Budapest about interoperability of air traffic management systems which is extremely important for Europe so that we do not lose our competitive advantages -, fourth the environment and fifth commerce or business."
"On business, as you know and as you mentioned, there are ridiculous restrictions on ownership rights."
"But it must also be very clear that we cannot force the United States to surrender; we must negotiate and this is sometimes not so obvious."
"We must negotiate and we have to take into account their concerns."
"It looks quite promising, but we definitely cannot win any commerce or especially technological confrontation: this should be avoided, it can be very dangerous."
"So, as I say, in October we committed to moving in these five directions and definitely the next agreements will follow and we will try with the new US Congress to facilitate market openings which will be the most difficult part as several of you have already mentioned."
"I would also like to say that, yes, the Vietnam agreement is of course by magnitude much smaller than the other agreements but it is very important that we form an aviation area which behaves with the same rules and which follows the same rules and this is exactly the aim of these agreements, especially - which is a difficult element in negotiations with third countries - the recognition of EU carriers."
"You know that this has been a very sensitive issue, and with these agreements with third countries we create better possibilities for European airlines as well."
"Thank you for your comments."
"I promise that we will keep you informed about all future developments."
"We have had several discussions in the TRAN Committee about the concepts of these negotiations and further development and, here again, one has to negotiate with difficult partners."
"This is the eternal truth of all negotiations but the picture has not been so bad."
"We have achieved a lot including with the United States, with the recognition of EU carriers and several other things."
"There I can assure you that I will again meet the leaders of the US transport policy; there is a certain willingness to cooperate and to find ways to solve our conflicting problems."
"Madam President, I am very grateful for all the opinions voiced on the air transport agreement between the European Union and the United States."
"I accept that the agreement is not perfect; it is another step in the right direction, but we have certainly not reached the end of the road."
"We were not able to amend this document for procedural reasons."
"Rejection of the agreement would however have meant sacrificing the gains made during both stages of negotiations."
"In my report, I have included a call for certain changes which should be the focus of the Joint Committee's work, or which should form the basis of a third stage of negotiations."
"In particular, I call for the further liberalisation of traffic rights, additional foreign investment opportunities, the adoption of a much more ambitious position on environmental protection and better coordination of political strategies on passenger rights in order to ensure passengers the highest possible level of protection."
"Ladies and gentlemen, my work on this document is not yet complete."
"I intend to monitor the actions of the Joint Committee, which was appointed in order to ensure that the agreement's provisions would be implemented appropriately or even extended."
"I will strive to ensure that a permanent observer sits on the Joint Committee on behalf of the European Parliament."
"If the committee does not live up to the hopes invested in it, Parliament should call on the Commission to open a third stage of negotiations."
"Finally, I would of course like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs for their comments and assistance when drafting this report."
"rapporteur. - (RO) Madam President, the air transport agreement between the European Union and Canada can be described as the most ambitious air transport agreement between the European Union and a major world partner."
"It will significantly improve the connections between the markets of both countries and the links between people, while also creating new opportunities for the airline sector through a gradual liberalisation of foreign ownership rules."
"In particular, the agreement is more ambitious and specific than the agreement between the European Union and United States on traffic rights, ownership and control, even following the provisional application of the amending protocol, which is therefore phase two."
"According to a study undertaken by the Commission, an open agreement with Canada would generate an additional half million passengers in its first year and, within a few years, 3.5 million new passengers might be expected to take advantage of the opportunities such an agreement could offer."
"The agreement could generate consumer benefits of at least EUR 72 million through lower fares and would also create new jobs."
"Madam President, we welcome the ambitious nature of this agreement."
"It should provide an objective and model for other negotiations currently in progress."
"In conclusion, I recommend Parliament to approve the EU-Canada Air Transport Agreement."
"Madam President, I shall be extremely brief for, as Commissioner Kallas has pointed out, the Agreement with Vietnam is a simple one, approved by all."
"It has not caused any difficulties for our own report and has the great merit of opening up the Vietnamese market to all European stakeholders through reciprocity with a country which operates according to a different economic model."
"I think that this Agreement should also be regarded as an important step geographically, as it opens up the East and the countries of South East Asia to us."
"I do not think therefore that there is anything left to be said other I am delighted that we have been able to reach a satisfactory conclusion with this Agreement, which will open up travel between Vietnam and Europe a little more."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11:30."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (PT) In recent years the European Union has negotiated and concluded several agreements with other states in the field of air transport."
"According to the Court of Justice, the traditional designation clauses in the existing bilateral agreements infringe EU law, as they constitute discrimination against EU carriers established in a Member State but owned and controlled by nationals of other Member States."
"As such agreements violate the principle of freedom of establishment, as set out in Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the EU has initiated and is developing a practice for the negotiation and conclusion of agreements between the EU, of the one part, and third countries, of the other part, with regard to air transport."
"We can identify the main elements of these agreements as the concerns relating to security, passenger rights, the mutual recognition of certification and cooperation on regulation."
"In this context, I would like to call attention to Parliament's limited role with regard to these dossiers."
"Following the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force, its opinion is binding, but only in terms of the final text which has already been signed; it cannot make suggestions or changes to its content."
"in writing. - (NL) The delegation of the Dutch Labour Party to the European Parliament certainly does not consider this second stage agreement to be perfect, but it takes the view that it will lead to progress in important areas."
"In addition, it will prevent the United States from activating the suspension clause in the absence of such an agreement."
"Suspension could lead to European passengers and airlines no longer being able to profit from the significant benefits which they have enjoyed since March 2008 thanks to this protocol."
"The benefits and positive aspects include, in particular, agreements on working standards for airline staff, sharing good practice with regard to noise abatement, strengthening cooperation in the field of environmental protection and so on. The delegation of the Dutch Labour Party to the European Parliament recognises the ongoing need to pursue a proper debate on safety requirements (such as the use of scanners) and the impact on privacy and health of passengers of such requirements."
"In addition, it would highlight the need for the privacy of European and US citizens to be put centre stage and respected when passengers' personal data is exchanged between the EU and the US."
"It is essential that Parliament is and remains involved in these negotiations and that European regulations are not eroded."
"in writing. - (HU) It is important to take the concerns of European citizens about respect for their data protection rights seriously."
"We consider it important that there be an agreement between the European Union and the United States on data protection in the field of cooperation in criminal and judicial matters."
"We welcome the fact that the Hungarian Presidency is actively engaged in the issue of data protection."
"We must specifically take note in this regard of the Council conclusions on data protection that were adopted at the February meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"We are looking forward to the Commission's proposals to ensure that both our liberties and the security of our data are protected and respected."
"Preparation of 2012 budget (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Balzani, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on general guidelines for the preparation of the 2012 budget [2011/2042 BUD]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the document we are examining today is not merely a report on the priorities of the next European budget, but also and above all a strategic document looking at the new role that the European budget must play in the context of greater economic governance."
"This is the first year of the European Semester, which has been designed precisely to establish the greatest possible coordination between the Union's budget and those of the Member States, the greatest possible synergy and the utmost complementarity."
"All of which essentially means one thing: convergence, and making the budgets of the Member States converge with the major goals of the European budget."
"Today, these objectives - these European objectives - can only be those laid down in the Europe 2020 Strategy: a grand, ambitious strategy with five highly important targets and seven big flagship initiatives."
"These are big, important goals, but they are also very specific."
"The first target is extremely important and involves building a more fully, better employed Europe by making the right investments."
"We therefore have a huge priority for the 2012 budget: we must not waste time in executing the 2020 Strategy, beginning with the first of the targets, that of higher employment in Europe."
"Immediately setting out the dimension of the 2020 Strategy in our budget is therefore essential and a matter of urgency."
"Two things are fundamental in order to achieve this: we must plan and we must look to the future."
"Planning means ruling out mathematical approaches to the budget, which are absolutely senseless."
"Mathematical, general and indiscriminate increases are of no use at all."
"Instead we must look at what exactly are the programmes and the actions that can contribute to the 2020 Strategy."
"Looking to the future has an absolutely crucial significance: taking the utmost care over our commitments and not simply over our payments, because commitments are the tool with which to build the sustainable financial future of our Union."
"Flexibility is another important subject."
"We are at the end of the planning period and so the budget is particularly rigid."
"I therefore think that it is really important that, right from the start, we consider all the available flexibility instruments as fundamental and indispensable for the budget we are going to draw up if we want it to be not only possible or essential to take the first step towards the 2020 Strategy - which absolutely must not be a failure, as we have seen in the past - but also if we want it to be a useful and effective budget."
"I am convinced that it will only be possible to reach all these major objectives if we work together patiently, right from the very start, to build a renewed climate of institutional cooperation."
"Institutional cooperation is one of the major challenges of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we always talk about rather carelessly."
"Institutional collaboration means really finding a renewed feeling of equality so as to work together on this sensitive issue, the budget, which is not only one of the most strategically important instruments to build our future, but also one of the most tangible and practical."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I welcome Parliament's position on the priorities of the 2012 budget as reflected in the proposed guidelines."
"The Commission, in line with its right of initiative, will of course take into account Parliament's guidelines and also assess the guidelines of the Council."
"On the other hand, we have to take into account the most recent data coming from the 27 Member States, and we will have our services carefully scrutinise and evaluate those elements in order to shape the draft budget on 20 April."
"This is now the second test of the annual procedure under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The context of financial consolidation is obvious to everybody."
"I think, in such a context, that it would be responsible to take into account and respond to all the fiscal financial obligations of the European Union, but also to bear in mind the context of austerity which is the reality in the Member States."
"At this time, more than ever, no-one could argue against the need to base the budget on the principles of rigorous and sound budgeting."
"It has never been so important to look for savings, but we should also use the tool of the European budget in order to help Europe in this post-crisis situation."
"With that in mind, I would point out two differences between national budgeting and Europe's budget."
"National budgeting is mainly about social transfers, about consumption."
"The European budget is about investment with multiplier effects."
"Therefore it could be conducive to growth and jobs."
"It is not good or sound budgeting to fail to pay out on the outstanding commitments agreed on in previous years, so both must be taken into account when shaping the final draft proposal for 2012."
"As mentioned in the letter from the President of the Commission, and as the rapporteur, Ms Balzani clearly stated, we must ensure sufficient funding for expenditure under the 2020 Strategy."
"Yes, we have to coordinate the efforts of national and European budgeting, but on the other hand, we must be especially rigorous when it comes to administrative expenditure - hence the Commission's commitment of less than 1% for administration."
"That means savings as regards contractual obligations and savings in areas such as conferences, mission costs, meetings and information technology."
"Taking into account what happened last year, we hope that this time it will be a smoother procedure, building on the experience of 2011."
"Therefore I am looking forward to our first trialogue meeting on 30 March."
"Then we will be ready to present our draft budget for 2012."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the guidelines we are shortly to vote on are the first step towards the European budget for 2012."
"Since the beginning, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has shown its support for a preliminary report containing an indication of Parliament's priorities for the forthcoming budget, which would then be presented to the Commission, as is done by the Council."
"Our contribution has helped broaden the scope of the priority policies and supported the balanced foundations laid by the rapporteur, Mrs Balzani, by inserting a number of strong and distinctive priorities that express the traditions of the PPE Group, namely development and growth for Europe together with research and innovation."
"Indeed, I think these are the policies that we should invest in for the future of the Union and that Parliament really ought to stress before the preliminary draft budget is tabled by the Commission."
"As Mr Lewandowski correctly pointed out a short time ago, we also insisted that the concept of responsibility should be at the heart of the 2012 budget."
"This is not to say that until now we have not exercised budgetary responsibility, but it highlights the fact that now more than before, as a result of the crisis, we must act responsibly."
"Lastly, I think something needs to be said about what has happened and what is happening in many countries in North Africa, simply to show that we reject medium-term approaches that are incapable of properly dealing with unexpected events or new policies."
"In terms of the technical aspect of the vote, I think it would be worth leaving the report produced by the Committee on Budgets substantially unchanged."
"I am really puzzled by the insistence of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left on including the tax on financial transactions."
"Quite apart from the substance of the issue, to me it seems to be of no relevance to the 2012 budget procedure."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (SV) Madam President, firstly, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Balzani."
"She has chosen a very wise starting point for her report."
"It is short, specific and constructive and has a clear focus on the most important issues."
"What then are the most important issues?"
"They involve demonstrating that the Europe 2020 Strategy is not just hot air, but a serious attempt to enable the EU to play a tangible role in promoting growth and jobs."
"The EU's budget is controversial, despite the fact that it is actually very small - around 1% of GDP or a little over 2% of overall public expenditure."
"However, it can play a strategic role when it comes to investments in projects that the Member States cannot manage by themselves or that require solidarity within Europe."
"These relate to research and development, infrastructure for transport and energy and being able to realise the true potential of the internal market - a well-functioning labour market in the EU and a real basis for growth and competitiveness."
"However, these joint projects cost money."
"Evidence is therefore required, particularly on the part of the Member States and the Council."
"Will the Europe 2020 Strategy be put into practice, or will it go the way of the Lisbon Strategy - good ideas that are buried in an office drawer?"
"I believe that the 2012 budget will be crucial in answering that question."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SV) Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work."
"In times like these it is no easy task to set budgetary priorities."
"I am also pleased that we are choosing to be guided by Europe 2020 for next year's budget."
"As was pointed out earlier, we cannot afford to wait until 2014 when the next budgetary framework enters into force to implement the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"The Commission has an important responsibility to put forward proposals in its draft budget this summer."
"We have so far been unable to direct resources to the Europe 2020 Strategy to the extent that would be needed."
"There is a risk that it could turn out exactly as Mr Färm warned: that the strategy does not get implemented but gets stuck in an office drawer, which we do not want, of course."
"My group tabled a number of amendments to the report and we are very pleased with the way in which they have been incorporated into the proposals."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for that."
"I have to say to the Council that we in the European Parliament most certainly have reason to examine ourselves and the way that we are approaching the 2011 budget."
"We have succeeded in creating a conflict that has surely given both ourselves and the politicians in the Council cause for reflection."
"We must consider how we can make the best possible use of the resources we have."
"We may perhaps have to consider making cuts in the EU budget, too."
"At the same time, we must not forget that the Union has been given a large number of tasks that have to be fulfilled."
"These tasks will not do themselves."
"Sometimes I have the feeling that the Council believes that things can just happen by themselves without us having to reprioritise or earmark resources, but that is unfortunately not the case."
"I look forward to a constructive proposal from the Commission that can help us to find a more constructive tone in the negotiations on the 2012 budget."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report."
"I think that, unlike the other guidelines which we have discussed over many others years in this House, it is focused and it does not get into a whole lot of different details, which are obviously to come later in the budget procedure."
"Firstly I would like to say that we in my group would like to take very much into account what is happening elsewhere in the European Union and not just keep it within the Brussels 'Beltway'."
"Therefore the paragraph you have put in paragraph 21 - where you are saying that we should be looking for negative priorities and savings by the institutions, asking our specialised committees to be able to look for priorities - is very important, but very little work has been done on this so far."
"Tied in to the desire, which I can fully understand, to have more monies available for the Europe 2020 Strategy and the flagships, we should be looking not just for actions which involve money, but strengthening of the single market."
"It is not just about monies."
"Where we are looking for monies we should be thinking about where we can be generating savings from elsewhere in the budget, as we are looking to do in Parliament and in the other institutions."
"We take the line that if you want more money then you can take it from savings elsewhere."
"This should also be an important part of our approach to the 2012 budget."
"Lastly, therefore, in looking at the kind of responsibility we should take in an era of austerity, if we are going to be able to cope with the savings of financing where we need new expenditure my group believes we should be heading for a freeze in our expenditure for 2012."
"This is not the case on a European level, because fortunately we are not allowed to get into debt. However, the politically clever solution involves not only reducing debt but also achieving a balance, so that it is possible to invest in projects for the future in order not to put the national economy further at risk."
"Reaching this balance must be one of the guidelines for the European budget in 2012. In addition, we have made commitments in recent years in the European budget which come out of the structural funds and which will have to be financed next year and in the years that follow."
"I think we should take Mrs Balzani's approach very seriously."
"It involves focusing on the most important areas of the EU 2020 Strategy, which determines where Europe is going."
"We are calling for more funding at a European level to allow us to combat climate change, to switch more quickly to renewable energy sources and to support education and research."
"We must continue to focus on these issues and we must not put this at risk."
"I also think that the European Semester mechanism is being used correctly to ensure that the Member States and the European budget, in other words a total of 28 budgets, commit to the targets in the EU 2020 Strategy."
"Where do we need to spend more money?"
"On the basis of what we hope will be democratic change in the Arab countries, we Europeans have an interest in supporting civil society, democratic structures and the move to parliamentary democracy in these states and, therefore, we need flexible funding to promote democracy throughout the world in our own well-understood interests."
"As a Member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I would like to ask specifically where we can make savings, in particular in the light of recent events in Japan."
"In my group we are of the opinion that we can save money on the ITER nuclear fusion reactor."
"We do not know what to do with the nuclear waste from this project."
"Why are we spending so much money on launching this project, when we should be redirecting the Euratom funding to enable us to move away from nuclear power and introduce renewable energy sources much more quickly?"
"When we look at the United Nations and at climate policy, we all know that we need to change the way we generate energy."
"The 2012 European budget must also make a contribution in this area."
"I hope that we will have the power to make qualitative changes of this kind in the next multiannual financial framework."
"Madam President, while we are here discussing the guidelines for the next budget, out there are tens of thousands of workers sending us a very clear message. They are telling us that the EU's austerity policies are killing the economy and destroying the benefits and the conditions of life for the European public."
"They are telling us that the model of economic coordination that is being imposed is based on fines and penalties that provide no guarantee of sustainable growth and job creation - quite the contrary, in fact."
"They are telling us that the Pact for the euro, which the governments are adopting today, is a pact that is against wages and pensions."
"It is a pact that is continuing to make the workers pay for the cost of the crisis, although it was not caused by them."
"I believe that we should listen to this protest, because it poses a key question from the point of view of the European budget about the place of public investment in discussions about economic policies."
"We have heard the conservatives say that what we need is a 'zero budget', with a 'zero increase'."
"We have heard various governments saying that, in the name of austerity policies, we need a European budget with a 'zero increase'."
"The discussion that we are having today is crucial, but this is the wrong answer."
"It is the wrong answer for one simple reason: it is impossible to have ever stronger austerity policies at a national level yet at the same time say that due to these austerity policies we need ever weaker European budgets."
"This reasoning inevitably leads to only one outcome: lower public investment at both national and European level."
"It also means more unemployment and more social regression."
"This is the crucial discussion to be held in talks on the 2012 budget."
"It argues against those who think that the crisis can be resolved by heightening inequality and transforming the recession itself into a policy."
"This is what my group is opposing."
"We are going to abstain from this report because it is full of good intentions, but it does not respond in a clear way to this challenge, and the world of work requires a response from us on this matter."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, this report's fundamental weakness is that it completely ignores the observations made by the Court of Auditors in its annual reports."
"We should remember that the only information available is on the integrity and efficiency with which European Union funds have been spent."
"The attempt to justify an increase in the budget on the basis that the Europe 2020 Strategy will take us out of the crisis lacks all credibility when we look back at the complete failure of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The threat - and it is a threat - that limiting the level of the European Union budget will have a detrimental effect on European solidarity and the pace of economic development in the Member States is both facile and displays an overwhelming ignorance of the impact of the crisis upon European citizens."
"On behalf of British taxpayers, I call on David Cameron to demand not a freeze, but a significant reduction of the budget for 2012."
"Given his track record today, I will not be holding my breath."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my opinion on three areas of Mrs Balzani's report."
"The first is that the report on the 2012 budget is based on the assumption of enhanced economic governance involving the EU, the European Semester mechanism and the Europe 2020 objectives to boost growth and employment."
"In next year's budget there will be support in particular for two headline targets in the strategy: improving education and promoting social inclusion, which for me are two key aspects with regard to Europe's future viability."
"Secondly, the report emphasises the need to improve synergies between European and national public investments in order to achieve the EU's political objectives more effectively."
"We need to encourage more coordination, greater consistency and a focus on sensible, shared objectives in order to make it more likely that the headline targets can be achieved successfully."
"My third point concerns climate change and energy targets."
"In the light of the disaster in Japan, we need to do everything possible to speed up the introduction of renewable energy sources."
"An active climate policy and the creation of green jobs will not only help us to achieve our climate targets, but will also make a positive contribution to social policy."
"Last but not least I would like to remind the House that the EU budget is not permitted to show a public deficit, which is why it is essential that it is implemented properly, and that it makes up only 2% of total public spending."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur Mrs Balzani for the flexibility she has shown."
"I say this because the original idea was not to hold this debate on budget guidelines."
"I believe, however, that it is a good idea, because it will help to define the priorities that will shape the budget negotiations over the coming months."
"I should like to touch on two fundamental matters."
"First of all, austerity."
"Austerity is not a principle, it is an instrument."
"It is an instrument for achieving a truly credible budget that will not lead us to the consequences that are now materialising in many countries: that is, spending beyond our means and later encountering serious political difficulties when it comes to closing the gaps in the budget."
"I also believe we should not bring matters into the annual budgetary procedure which actually have a multiannual financial scope."
"I am referring, for instance, to the issue of the tax or levy on financial transactions."
"This belongs in a far wider financial framework, so any attempt to artificially bring this debate into the annual budget will only lead to a misguided strategy of negotiation with the Council right from the start."
"Only last year we saw what happens when we bring into a single-reading annual budget procedure, policies or ideas that actually have a wider scope: failure, stalemate and, ultimately, a situation - as we are now experiencing in 2011 - in which the level of credit appropriations is, as the Commissioner is perfectly well aware, insufficient to cover the immediate short-term needs of the European Union over the coming months."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we are debating the need to make savings in view of the debt crisis that we are experiencing in the Member States."
"Mrs Trüpel and others have quite rightly pointed out that this debt crisis affects us only indirectly, as it is not permitted for debts to be incurred at European level."
"Yet how can we pursue an austerity policy in the European Union if the volume of European expenditure is only 2% of the total public expenditure of all 27 Member States?"
"I believe that this is not an austerity policy at all."
"Instead, it is a question of symbols - symbols that are in some way passed to us by the Member States as if money that is transferred to Brussels for the European budget in effect disappears into a deep black hole."
"This completely ignores the fact that the funds that go into the European budget actually go back to the Member States again."
"Of course, they do not go back at a ratio of 1:1, as Europe is not a savings bank, and we naturally pursue a policy of solidarity where we support those in the European Union that are less well developed."
"For example, in my state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, all of the labour market instruments that are now implemented there are cofinanced by the European Social Fund."
"If we remove this funding, there will be correspondingly less labour market policy."
"That cannot be what Social Democrats are aiming for."
"Let us consider for a moment how the Member States spend European funds."
"The Court of Auditors' annual report states that there are deficiencies in the way the management and control systems for spending European funds operate."
"It states that the recovery of wrongly invested funds in the Member States runs into billions of euro."
"It also states that the Commission is now, thankfully, going to suspend payments in cases where European programmes are being mismanaged."
"That is also happening for example in Germany and the United Kingdom."
"The Council, which is not here, represents the Member States, which I urgently call on to improve their management of EU budgetary resources."
"The increase in efficiency that this would make possible would allow us to considerably improve the way we spend EU funds - not by spending more money but by improving the way we spend it."
"The Member States can play a part in this in order to underline their willingness to make savings."
"(DA) Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Balzani."
"I think she has a very exciting, but also very difficult task in negotiating this budget, and that is because the framework is tight."
"The seven-year framework for the EU's budget is devised in such a way that the framework becomes steadily tighter during the course of the seven-year period, particularly in the area of agriculture."
"We have actually been able to utilise unused agricultural funds almost as a means of financing new initiatives such as energy investments for the recovery package and the satellite navigation system Galileo."
"It is therefore becoming more and more difficult to ensure consistency."
"I do not agree with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that we should not finance the ITER fusion energy system."
"This is important research, particularly in the light of what has happened in Japan and against the background of the need to ensure that we are not dependent on fossil fuels. Thus, this is also a difficult task."
"We must find funding for the fusion energy project in 2012."
"I am pleased that the Commissioner emphasised the fact that the EU's budget is not the same as national budgets."
"It is a project budget, and the EU must be able to settle its accounts."
"We must pay out the money that we have promised."
"In this regard, I hope that the Commissioner is right that our budget negotiations will be smoother this time around."
"That will require the Council to behave in a more intelligent and less stupid way - for it to give us a very definite figure for the payments, but to be more specific and look at what the real needs are."
"Last but not least, I would like to thank the Commissioner for stating that we must cut our administrative expenditure, because this is one of the few areas where we actually can save money in the short term."
"I think it is good that he started by saying that the Commission is reducing its administrative expenditure to next to nothing."
"That is something we should also do in other institutions, and I believe that it is something that we really should take seriously - also in Parliament."
"- (CS) Madam President, the 2012 budget of the European Union should continue the tradition of balanced budgets."
"On the other hand, we must not continue with the disputes we saw when approving the 2011 budget."
"We must not allow the creation of a temporary budget."
"That would have a very negative effect on the running of the EU."
"In order to avoid disputes and approve the budget quickly, we need to propose a sensible budget, which, in the current period of lingering economic crisis, means a tight budget."
"The public in the Member States expect that, in a time of spending cuts, the EU too will run its affairs well and frugally."
"If we lose sight of this, we will lose credibility."
"(PT) Madam President, we are having our say in this debate in order to show that there is an alternative to the consensus between law and democratic socialism, which has brought this crisis upon us."
"This consensus does not, in itself, allow for any possibility of ending the crisis."
"The alternative, which is both possible and necessary, is also undergoing profound changes due to EU budgetary policies, reconsidering the resources and objectives which these serve."
"At a time when inequalities between the different Member States are growing, the EU budget should be at the service of real convergence, promoting the full exploitation of the actual potential of each country, the creation of employment with rights, the eradication of poverty and social exclusion, and the preservation of the environment."
"It should be a tool at the service of genuine economic and social cohesion."
"We reject a budget which is at the service of the commercialisation of more and more aspects of social life, liberalisation in numerous areas of economic activity, and lack of job security, as advocated by the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"This path will accentuate the existing economic, social, regional and national divisions and disparities, and foment structural unemployment."
"We therefore propose a new European strategy for solidarity and sustainable development, underpinned by a new set of economic, social and environmental policies, supported by the EU budget, as we explained in our set of proposed amendments to this report."
"The Union budget should also be at the service of a genuine policy of development aid, cooperation and peace, not at the service of external interventionism, interference, militarism and war, areas that have taken an increasing toll on the Community budget."
"We would therefore like to point out the urgency of steering Europe along a different course, and this should also be reflected in budgetary decisions."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this report - which ought to map out Parliament's guidelines for the 2012 budget - seems to me to be pretty much devoid of meaning."
"It only includes a series of vague statements and therefore it does not seem clear to me what Parliament's real priorities are for drafting the new budget."
"For example, the Europe 2020 Strategy is mentioned a number of times."
"It is an ambitious, wasteful and perhaps overly broad strategy."
"What in any case are supposed to be its priorities?"
"It is the Member States themselves that have to come to terms with restricted budgets and the consequences of the crisis; we cannot be so naïve as to the think that we can do much at a European level."
"Therefore I would have preferred to see fewer statements of intent and fewer words and instead an indication of a few limited and precise areas in which to act."
"I am aware that this report is dealing with general guidelines, but in its current state it seems to me to be all but useless and merely self-serving."
"(NL) Madam President, Mrs Balzani from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has proved with her report the following fact: the EU does not look after its citizens well, but it does look after itself."
"The ruling Socialist and Christian Democrat clique is making sure there is a continuing majority in Parliament who are in favour of wasting even more money."
"A nice sum of EUR 3 000 per member for a staff allowance, a good job on the side in the House of European History (for those fortunate enough to have the right connections), a totally unnecessary and terribly expensive European TV channel, a prestigious satellite project called Galileo, all of which is leading increasingly to financial disaster."
"Oh well, things are clear ... and, on top of that, having the nerve to speak about sustainability and responsibility."
"There is no responsibility to speak of and sustainability is only possible if things are expensive."
"Madam President, I will keep it short and clear: throw out this nonsensical report."
"This is absolutely not what the citizens of Europe are waiting for."
"The EU is giving no sign of wanting to economise and, on top of that, this will only lead to more money being wasted."
"I thought that wisdom comes with age, but that unfortunately does not seem to be the case with this Parliament."
"(HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after the last few speeches, I recommend that we try to return to the grounds of reason."
"The rapporteur was in no easy situation when she was preparing her material."
"After all, we can not yet talk about figures in any meaningful way until the Commission presents to us the boundaries within which it foresees the budget for the next year."
"We can, however, talk about principles."
"And in this regard, the rapporteur partially approached the matter very aptly, in that she attempted to integrate the 2020 policy within the bounds of the budget."
"On the other hand, her decision to not yet get involved in policies at this stage, and to not talk about their outlines and objectives either, indeed justifies certain critical comments that the material seems somewhat hollow."
"I believe that we can still all agree that, similar to previous years, we continue to consider cohesion policy extremely important."
"This policy will only really swing into motion now, at the end of the cycle, and it is here that the greatest payment requests will appear."
"I would very much like to stress, contrary to others, that these payments are not for their own sake, and that this is not about spending the money, but rather about using it in ways which actually further the European cause, and bring us forward in assisting less developed regions in catching up."
"If they are not doing this, they are doing wrong."
"Then Parliament must indeed step up against any kind of inappropriate spending and spending in the nature of prestige investments."
"I believe that the Committee on Budgets, in cooperation with the committees, is handling this twofold fight quite well. Thank you for your attention."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Balzani, for the consistency of her draft resolution on the general guidelines for the 2012 budget."
"This resolution sends a clear political message."
"It is because it is fully aware of the budgetary constraints affecting the European Union that Parliament is today calling for the adoption of a 2012 budget that can respond to the political, economic and social challenges we currently face."
"At a time when the sole topic of discussion among the Member States is the implementation of additional austerity measures, Parliament, at least on this side of the House, intends to demonstrate its commitment to the thousands of workers who, today, are marching through the streets of Brussels to show their rejection of these economically questionable and socially unjust measures, the result of which will be a further increase in structural unemployment in Europe."
"The fact that the European budget is being aligned with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy, in a clear way for the first time in 2012, means that employment and growth can be put back at the heart of European policies, which I would point out are our priorities, since the EU 2020 Strategy has set the objective of an employment rate of 75% of the working population."
"However, let us not delude ourselves."
"This budgetary procedure will be a long and difficult one, contrary to what Mr Lewandowski indicated in the French press when he anticipated the position of the MEPs."
"The Member States have already expressed their short-term view of the budget, which advocates discipline, and have called for a limit on their contribution to financing Community action."
"They see the European Union and its action not as a means to achieve added value or as a means to help it achieve ambitious policies, but rather as an additional cost."
"Let us not be mistaken."
"The 2012 budgetary procedure will provide another insight into the tactics being used to define the future multiannual financial framework."
"The fact is, with a budget which accounts for a mere 2% of the EU's public expenditure, it will be difficult to pursue ambitious policies in all sectors."
"We are already seeing stormy debates on whether it will be the CAP or cohesion policy that will be plundered."
"This pits citizens against each other when it would be to our credit to help them work in synergy."
"That is why, Commissioner, I would reiterate the importance of your communication on the implementation of own resources."
"(NL) Madam President, if you are having a house built, the biggest bills come at the end."
"You know this in advance and that is what you agree to from the very start."
"The same thing is happening in Europe."
"The biggest bills come at the end of multi-annual budgets and you know that, too, ahead of time."
"Refusals by various Member States, such as my home country, the Netherlands, to pay these bills are therefore nothing more than a reaction by unreliable governments."
"This is the same as if somebody who is having their house built accepted the offer and then refused to pay the final bill."
"Obviously, in the final stage, you can look at where you can make savings and we in Europe have to do that as well."
"In recital 21, in particular, Mrs Balzani has rightly pointed to that fact."
"However, that final bill will still have to be paid."
"Refusing to pay it does not only make you unreliable, it is also stoking the anti-European sentiments in Europe."
"(HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2012 budget is the sixth among the seven budgets of the current multiannual financial framework."
"The two arms of the budgetary authority have therefore gained a clear picture of the deficiencies and positive developments with regard to the existing multiannual programmes."
"The 2012 appropriations must enable the accomplishment of EU goals and priorities in relation to the 2020 Strategy. That is because it is this that facilitates Europe emerging from the crisis strengthened."
"The promotion of employment, innovation, research and development, the facilitation of goals related to energy strategy and of social inclusion, in particular through the reduction of poverty."
"The 2020 Strategy can of course only be credible if it receives appropriate funding."
"We would like to remind everyone that Parliament has raised this serious political concern on several occasions."
"Now we must call on the Member States and the Council to take responsible and decisive steps."
"We must not be content with a lesser Europe in a world where natural disasters and economic crises can ruin the lives of millions without warning, where the impact of such tragedies not only affects one country, people or religious community, but has an effect on entire regions and across oceans."
"We need a greater Europe, and a more effective use of Community means. Thank you for your attention."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the 2012 budget is set against the background of a difficult economic and financial situation in the 27 Member States."
"For this reason, we will certainly not be able to afford to do everything that we would like to do."
"I believe that the report tabled by Mrs Balzani is a workable compromise."
"However, I also have a few critical remarks to make."
"In my opinion, more money does not necessarily mean more solidarity and more Europe."
"What is important is to improve the quality of what we get in return for the money spent and above all to ensure that the objectives we set ourselves are actually achieved rather than the money merely being paid out regardless."
"We must always examine the question of our potential new own resources with a critical eye, too."
"These own resources must not lead to the additional burdening of citizens or of businesses that need to be, and should be, able to compete with the rest of the world."
"I also think it is important for us not always to emphasise the fact that the EU budget amounts to only 2% because, at the end of the day, many States cofinance the corresponding European funds, thus, of course, making a considerably larger volume of funds available on the basis of EU programmes."
"I think it is particularly important for us to make progress in terms of research, education, sustainability and strengthening economic growth."
"In light of this, I think it is also important for large-scale projects such as ITER - and in this regard I would like to thank Mrs Jensen for her comment - to be fully and clearly financed and clearly managed, because otherwise the Americans, who are currently implementing the same project, will be appreciably ahead of us, and we Europeans should not always take second place."
"(PT) Madam President, I would like to begin by saying that I welcome the work of Mrs Balzani, but that I would nevertheless like to make a few observations here."
"I believe that the general approach that is being adopted is actually too general."
"I think that this is more of a resolution for an EU 2020 Strategy than proper guidelines for 2012."
"In 2011 the priority has been on young people, and this will no longer be the case in 2012 with these guidelines."
"However, there is still time."
"The phrase 'young people' does not appear a single time in these general guidelines."
"Moreover, the focus on the Europe 2020 Strategy, which I support, does lead to cohesion policy, for example, being forgotten."
"Neither is there a single mention of cohesion policy."
"Cohesion policy is extremely important, and it cannot be a measure for adapting, or a measure or policy which suffers, for example, if money is taken from it in order to be given to the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"There is not a single mention of the cohesion policy, which we believe to be extremely important."
"I believe that there is time to remedy this omission, as I see it."
"I believe that there is still time to resolve these two issues."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Balzani, for the work she has done."
"The 2012 and 2013 budgets will be consolidation budgets aimed at reflecting the Member States' spending cutbacks and setting a benchmark for amounts that will be established in the next financial framework."
"The contribution of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) to the guidelines for the 2012 budget was based on the concept of responsibility, which means pursuing the aims of economy, efficiency and effectiveness using as little as possible of the available resources."
"The EU 2020 Strategy is based on important priorities - namely research, innovation, development and growth - that were not initially present in the report by Mrs Balzani, but which have been strongly emphasised by the PPE Group."
"The Union's priorities need a suitable level of funding."
"It is therefore important to ensure flexibility between the expenditure headings in order to more effectively counter the problems linked to the economic crisis and also to propose a budgetary framework that includes own resources."
"However, I am not in favour of these resources being raised via the introduction of a tax on financial transactions, as proposed by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left."
"Instead, I am in favour of an investigation by the Commission into how to deal with this highly important issue in technical terms, so as to affirm and establish Europe's added value."
". - (SK) Madam President, the European Union has set five measurable objectives for the period up to 2020."
"The objectives have also been agreed by Member States themselves."
"The objectives show us the direction we ought to choose."
"The success of Europe depends on how we fulfil them."
"It depends on the responsible conduct of individual states as to whether we will have higher employment, whether we will manage to reduce the proportion of people leaving school early, whether we will achieve the planned parameters in the number of young people obtaining a university education, whether we will reduce the number of people at risk of poverty and whether we will protect our climate."
"Despite the prevailing consensus in the EU over the common procedures, the government of my country has decided to restrict the priority operational programmes."
"It wants to use them for funding high-speed communications, and is discussing this with the Commission."
"I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether you personally and the Commission as a whole support states taking a path which goes against the common objectives in this first introductory stage of fulfilling the Europe 2020 Strategy?"
"- (SK) Madam President, the budget is a key instrument for European integration, and how it is set therefore matters."
"It is precisely in a time of crisis that the EU budget can contribute to mitigating the restrictive budgetary policies of national governments and direct funding towards desirable long-term investment projects."
"In this context, I welcome the fact that the report supports the plan to introduce project bonds, for example, in the area of infrastructure."
"I would like to point out, however, that they should not be regarded as an alternative to Eurobonds."
"In my opinion, Eurobonds are a special topic and I support their introduction, as they are a logical continuation of the integration process and they mark a deepening of the process."
"An opposite tendency - towards disintegration - would result from, for example, attempts to slash EU budget levels."
"In addition to the unfavourable economic impacts, these attempts also undermine solidarity between Member States."
"The selfish and short-sighted division into net contributors and net beneficiaries ignores the deeper and more important context of European integration."
"All Member States can profit from this equally."
"In my opinion, this is the angle to take in discussions on the EU budget."
"- (SK) Madam President, we are addressing the 2012 budget priorities with an eye to the future as well, and in my opinion we should therefore also look at the possibilities for making savings in the future."
"In my view, it is very important to think about the regular journeys made by MEPs and the entire European Parliament to Strasbourg, which is repeated 12 times a year."
"I believe that we irritate our citizens with these activities, because taxpayers have to finance our trips, and it costs them a great deal of money."
"We should therefore, if not in 2012, at least in the long-term perspective, look at the possibility of scaling back or modifying this mechanism in the future."
"Another potential saving which should be discussed, I think, is the cost of setting up the museum of the European Union or of Europe, which, from a time perspective, could be postponed until a future date, I believe, when the EU is faring better."
"At present we could transfer this funding to other activities, especially in 2012, in order to fulfil the 2012 programme, and thereby also improve the efficiency of our operations, of course."
"- (SK) Madam President, I would first like to applaud the work of the rapporteur, who has correctly identified numerous problems in her report."
"The EU budget for 2012, but also for the following years, should be ambitious, if we want to fulfil the tasks and objectives of the 2020 Strategy, emerge victorious from the crisis and compete globally."
"I support the budget committee proposal for meetings to be organised with national parliaments with the aim of discussing the outlines of EU and Member State budgets for 2012."
"It should be emphasised at these meetings that the EU budget must not be in deficit, that it represents only 2% of overall public spending in the EU and that there are fundamental differences between Member State budgets and the EU budget."
"The EU budget largely covers investment in the future of Europe."
"The Council, above all, should be aware of this, since we have already heard the representatives of Germany, France and Great Britain talk about trying to freeze the EU budget, through which we would surely slow down European growth."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I will address three points only."
"On the 2020 Strategy adjustment, a clear point in Ms Balzani's guidelines: in the current 2011 budget, 41% of expenditure could be attributed to the goals of the 2020 Strategy."
"The same effort is being made for the 2012 Strategy, but we must make the readjustment effort within the framework which was agreed several years ago, the 2007-2013 framework."
"It is, of course, limiting our room for manoeuvre that the adjustment must be done within the framework of the multiannual agreement dated 2006."
"Secondly, my reaction to Mr Elles - but not only to him: the same remark about negative priorities was also made by Mr Geier and Ms Hohlmeier."
"I am afraid that this is a true story about 2012's budget."
"It should be like that."
"This time more than ever, in addition to positive priorities, we should examine what is not performing."
"We are looking at what is not performing, what is not properly administered in order to find savings."
"We are thinking as much about positive priorities this time as about negative priorities."
"For the administration, austerity is a must."
"My response to Mr Herczog about the waste of money: administration accounts for only 5.7% of the total budget of the European Union."
"This is a lower proportion than in the municipalities of Rotterdam and many other Dutch cities famous for a frugal approach to budgeting."
"In response to Ms Andreasen: she was not only talking about freezing the budget."
"She was talking about cutting it."
"Our budget, the European budget, which is without deficit, cannot be blamed for the mismanagement of public finances in many Member States."
"It has its logic, as so clearly explained by Mr Gerbrandy."
"The logic is all about the maturity of programmes with time."
"This is not surprising."
"This is our credibility."
"The European budget has its own credibility which is all about commitments and accomplished projects paying out."
"Even in times of austerity, you have to pay your electricity bills."
"This is really about our credibility."
"This is about cohesion."
"This is really an investment, and its nature therefore probably also responds to some of the calls by those who are now demonstrating outside Parliament and the Berlaymont building."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the word 'responsibility' has been mentioned a number of times during the speeches."
"There is, however, one responsibility that I really think takes priority for the institutions: above all we are responsible for implementing our programmes and ensuring that EU citizens are not left with just our words."
"We have the responsibility to be consistent in what we say and what we promise."
"Today's major projects are those set out in the 2020 Strategy."
"The first target of 'more work' is not only very ambitious but also very precise, since it can even be measured using unemployment reduction parameters."
"This seems to me to be a very specific and very ambitious goal and I think it is essential to start working to achieve it."
"As long as we continue to consider the 2020 Strategy as too big and too ambitious to be squeezed into a practical document like the budget, I think we will achieve nothing more than increasing the risk of another failure, which is exactly what nobody wants, starting with the Commission, if I remember the first communication on the 2020 Strategy correctly."
"There is, however, another important issue: austerity is not a policy, it is not an instrument, it is a condition against which we must take action, and not only by consolidating our expenditure, but also by using the European budget, an extraordinary instrument that is radically different from the national budgets and gives us the chance to do something different this year."
"This is precisely what the European Semester is for."
"Clogging up the first six months of the year is not its only use."
"It enables us to come up with a global strategy and to create synergies; and creating synergies between the budgets of the Member States and our budget is an extraordinarily European system to give more value to public resources and to create a real method to turn the 2020 Strategy - long and ambitious as it is - into a European reality."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11:30."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"Unfortunately this report advocates 'a 2012 budget under the auspices of enhanced European economic governance, the European Semester mechanism and Europe 2020 objectives'."
"In other words, this is a budget which supports the deepening of neoliberalism, militarism and federalism in the EU through the adoption of profoundly anti-social and anti-democratic measures, the firm establishment of the Stability Pact, the enforcing of brutal fines on the Member States and permanent monitoring of all national macroeconomic activity."
"This is also a proposal which seeks to achieve a budget that facilitates liberalisation, job insecurity, and an attack on rights and public services."
"We therefore propose an important set of changes, aimed not only at denouncing this approach, but also at presenting guidelines for an alternative which is both possible and necessary."
"These proposals are crucial in order to improve the situation of unemployment, poverty and inequality which exists and is worsening with capitalism, of which the EU is a tool."
"The EU budget needs to be based on another vision in order to address the economic and social crisis, rejecting the neoliberal path, so-called economic governance and the strengthening of militarism."
"in writing. - (CS) In her report on general guidelines for the preparation of the 2012 budget, Mrs Balzani set out the five key budget priorities of the EU."
"I fully support her view that it is the Europe 2020 Strategy that should help Europe overcome the global economic crisis and emerge stronger from the crisis through the creation of new jobs based on the five priorities, that is, support for employment, improved conditions for innovation, research and development and the provision of funding for these from the public purse, the fulfilment of objectives on climate change and energy, higher levels of education and support for social inclusion, and, above all, reduction of poverty in Europe."
"However, if we want to be successful and to implement this strategy in earnest, we must assign sufficient funding for it, without substantial compromises or cuts."
"The current multiannual financial framework now offers very little room for manoeuvre, and I therefore agree with the rapporteur that further attempts to limit or cut budgetary resources related to the fulfilment of key priorities are simply out of place at the moment."
"I support the rapporteur's idea that the fulfilment of key priorities can work as a catalyst for boosting investment, growth and job creation throughout the Union."
"In general, I agree with the proposed guidelines and I recommend the approval of this report."
"in writing. - Across Europe governments and public authorities are having to find ways to save money and show restraint."
"My own country, Scotland, was hit by a double whammy - a global recession exacerbated by misrule by governments in London, always willing to plunder Scotland's resources but intent on denying the people of Scotland control over their own affairs."
"The Scottish government has therefore had to work extra hard to succeed in maintaining Scotland's vital public services."
"In these economic circumstances it is wholly unrealistic for this house to call for a budgetary increase - Europe's public services must have priority over the operations of the EU's institutions."

"(ET) Mr President, inherent in the concept of Europe working together is the idea that, in principle, the euro area can only go in two directions: it can either become stronger or disintegrate."
"In the current economic situation, a practical and decisive political response is needed."
"I support the creation of the stability mechanism, and accordingly I also supported the report, which paves the way for a legal framework enabling the creation of this mechanism."

"Our heads are in the sand, like the proverbial ostrich."
"We do not just have a currency crisis; we have a banking crisis and we have a sovereign debt crisis."
"And yet we persist in putting sticking plaster on deep wounds."
"My own country, Ireland, is shouldering intolerable debt, all because German, French, Irish, British and other banks - along with lax regulation and non-existent supervision - acted like casinos."
"Bad debt has become citizens' debt."

"All of this happened under the noses of the ECB, with interest rates that were totally inappropriate."
"Irish citizens are expected to deal with all of this."
"Nobody is prepared to face reality."
"The debt is unsustainable."
"We have been trying to buy time with bailouts."
"What we need is major restructuring."
"(FI) Mr President, the creation of a permanent crisis management mechanism for Europe is justified in case of future economic and financial crises."
"No one wants crises, but they are bound to happen and we need to prepare for the worst."
"It is unfortunate that the plan is to establish this crisis management mechanism outside the EU institutions."
"The mechanism should now be brought as close as possible to EU institutions."
"It is also important and a good thing that the United Kingdom and Sweden, countries outside the euro area, can participate in this mechanism."
"I support the attempts to step up coordination of economic policy in Europe, and the notion that, if there are to be sanctions, the Commission will decide on them, and they will apply automatically and not become the subject of discussions or 'horsetrading'."
"Mr President, I had thought that after 12 years in this House nothing could faze me any more, but I was shocked by the tone in which Mr Brok introduced his report yesterday."
"What shocked me was not the arrogance or the disconnection from reality, or even the disdain for public opinion, but the flagrancy."
"He said in so many words that we have had to avoid the usual Treaty revision procedure because otherwise it might have triggered a referendum in some Member States!"
"There you see unsheathed the contempt for the voters that the elites of Europe now habitually display."
"Public opinion is treated not as a reason to change direction, but as an obstacle to be overcome."
"I cannot help being reminded of Mr Brok's countryman's words following the rising in East Berlin."
"Would it not therefore be easier to dissolve the people and elect another in their place?"
"Mr President, one of the inherent problems of a single currency which has a number of different Member States, with economic cycles at different rates, is that it is pointless having one set of interest rates if you have different spending decisions."
"The result of that has obviously come to bear, because we can see the problems that the euro zone is in."
"On top of that, governments have to understand that they cannot spend more money than they get in revenue."
"When governments do that and cook the books, or do not fulfil the roles of economic governance and economic discipline, the others get into trouble."
"Of course, we want a strong euro zone, especially for those members outside the euro zone."
"We want to continue to trade with countries in the euro zone."
"We do not benefit from a weaker euro."
"However, at the same time, we have to be quite clear that the countries in the euro zone should fight their own problems themselves, and not rely on others."
"I wish you luck in the euro zone, but please learn the lessons of not spending more money than you earn."
"Mr President, I want to make clear on behalf of the European Conservative and Reformist Group that we are in favour of the European Stability Mechanism which has been set up, but we voted against the Brok/Gualtieri report because that opinion was not in line with the conclusions reached by the Council."
"What the Brok/Gualtieri report wanted was for the European Parliament and for the Commission effectively to interfere with an intergovernmental mechanism."
"It is entirely appropriate that this mechanism should be intergovernmental because of the enormous sums of money which are being committed to it."
"National ministers responsible to their national parliaments: that is the correct line of responsibility."
"Underlying the whole euro crisis, of course, is not a problem with the euro, but a problem with governments that are spending too much of their taxpayers' money."
"Mr President, I welcome the conclusion of the second phase of the US-EU open skies agreement."
"I think this is a breakthrough, but obviously there are those of us who would want more liberalisation and a move away from the protectionism which still hinders this industry in many ways."
"I would like to see the US remove its barriers or its restrictions on foreign ownership, and I think passengers across the world would benefit from more open skies agreements."
"I also pay tribute to the ECR shadow rapporteur, Jackie Foster, who is an expert in this area, and who has worked in the area of air transport as well as in the Transport Committee."
"However, I think it is very important that we continue to push for further liberalisation not only on the EU-US agreement but also in the emerging markets of Asia, so I welcome the move today with regard to the agreement on the EU-Vietnam agreement."
"Long may we continue to have better access to the growing markets of the world."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Balzani, for the excellent work she has accomplished."
"Getting to the heart of the matter, there are four points in this own-initiative report that I think are crucial."
"The first, in general terms, is the explicit reference to the European Union budget and its redistributive nature, which are the cornerstones of European solidarity."
"The second, in specific terms, reaffirms the principle that outstanding commitments - which are particularly high in the cohesion sector - ought to be carried out and not, as the Council suggests, simply cut out."
"The third sets out some doubts - entirely reasonably in my view - as to the effectiveness of an estimate criterion based on performance in the previous year."
"The fourth urges the Commission to formulate proposals for the creation of new resources and, in particular, new resources must be designed to combat the persistent effects of the crisis with a robust and effective commitment to policies for innovation, research and growth in economic, productive and employment terms across Europe."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at such an important time, a document like the one approved today is certainly based on criteria of good sense and reason."
"Supporting the 2020 Strategy is without doubt not only a sign of credibility but also of consistency in the actions of Parliament."
"However, a number of important criteria and guidelines must be strengthened further by means of a list showing the priorities of the interventions."
"Today, at such a delicate time in which the difficulties in the Mediterranean above all, but also in Japan, are directly linked to a rapidly changing situation, an authoritative and credible Parliament is needed, together with responses that provide a boost for growth, competitiveness and intelligent sustainability in the things that need to be done."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that at such a delicate time for the finances of the Member States of Europe, as was said a short time ago, I should like to sound an alarm about an expenditure that is under discussion in the Committee on Budgets: the astonishing case of the vast expenses set aside for the House of European History."
"I think it would be a disgrace if it were approved."
"We already own the Eastman Building, but between EUR 26 million and EUR 31 million have been allocated merely for renovation costs, plus EUR 3.3 million for the plans alone."
"The fixed costs amount to more than EUR 3 million whilst the variable costs come to EUR 3.2 million, plus EUR 3.2 million for a 50-strong staff, EUR 2 million for security and then EUR 13.45 million are required just to manage it."
"I think we ought to set an example of prudent spending through our institutions."
"This, however, would be a disgrace."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to make three comments, if I may, with regard to the general guidelines for the preparation of the 2012 budget."
"Firstly, I think it is good that we are debating the 2012 budget at an early stage, because - secondly - we do not want another calamity like we had between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission with regard to the 2011 budget."
"Thirdly, I am particularly proud of the fact that the European budget does not need to go into borrowing."
"I believe that should also continue to be the case."
"(ET) Mr President, legal immigration undoubtedly has a large role to play in promoting European economic development and improving competitiveness."
"There is certainly a recurring problem here, though, and that is the lack of a firm legal status for immigrants and, as a result, the possibility of discrimination against them."
"It is not normal to have a situation where, in the 21st century, we still see incidents which essentially involve slavery."
"Everyone must be treated equally in the labour market."
"This report contained the provisions that are currently lacking in our framework of standards, and I therefore supported the creation of a legal framework in this area, something which I consider to be very important."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, administrative simplification and facilitating access to relevant information are the right instruments to make the European labour market more attractive to third-country workers."
"Provisions for a single application procedure leading to one combined title encompassing both residence and work permits within one administrative act will contribute to simplifying and harmonising the rules currently applicable in Member States."
"This will make for a clearer and more efficient procedure both for the migrants and for their employers, whilst at the same time allowing for easier controls of the lawfulness of their residence and employment."
"The single procedure will also mean that the rights gap between EU citizens and third-country citizens can also be reduced."
"That is why I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Mathieu."
"- (SK) Mr President, I voted against the approved draft of the directive."
"I consider it important to apply a single procedure for handling work permits and residency permits."
"It is equally vital to try and create a single set of rights for third country nationals legally living and working in any of the EU Member States."
"It is without doubt also necessary to have legal certainty and transparency in respect of the decisions taken by the competent national bodies when handling these applications."
"Since they have a considerable influence on the lives of these people, they should be assessed as objectively as possible."
"Equal treatment should be guaranteed in all areas of social provision, and their rights must be upheld in legislation."
"Since these changes were not incorporated into the directive on economic migration, I think it was not correct of the parties on the right to approve it."
"(FI) Mr President, first of all, the fact that this single permit promises the same rights and the same treatment for foreign workers is a good starting point."
"We have to ensure that human rights in the European Union are implemented in such a way that workers coming here from third countries also receive the same pay and the same levels of social security, and that the same conditions of employment apply to them as well as the other employees."
"This is obviously a basic consideration."
"I am rather worried about one matter concerning the report, although I did vote in favour of it."
"This is the scope of application of Article 3, which still does not cover posted or seasonal workers or intracorporate transferees from third countries."
"It is to be hoped that progress will be made on this, so that everyone will be considered equally in this single permit package."
"The onestopshop principle is a positive thing: the idea that everyone can apply for this permit in one place and that they no longer have to hop from pillar to post because of red tape."
"(DE) Mr President, I absolutely agree with those Members who say that we must ensure equal treatment for workers from third countries who have been employed in the EU for more than a year."
"I also agree that workers who have been working in the European Union for less than six months must not receive equal treatment in respect of family allowances and unemployment benefit."
"However, I am very much in favour - and I would like to emphasise this once again - of these groups also being insured against accidents and sickness."
"Thirdly, I believe that old-age benefits are a component of a person's wages and, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, it should be possible to transfer them according to the rules of the Member States, provided that this only happens if the third country is also happy for this to be done and if it actually transfers them."
"Mr President, I welcome the fact that we are beginning our preparations for the 2012 budget so early."
"It allows for there to be proper consideration of the issues."
"One of the matters that we talk a great deal about in the European Union, and in this Chamber, is the issue of solidarity."
"We are often very keen to show solidarity for various groups of people."
"I would ask this Parliament to show some solidarity with the taxpayers of our constituencies, because we have so far failed to do that."
"In this age of austerity we need to show restraint."
"We should set an example."
"We should do so by freezing the salaries and allowances of all MEPs and officials in this place for 2012, and we should also abandon plans for the House of European History, which will cost millions of euros to construct and for which there is no long-term plan to fund."
"No doubt that will fall on the taxpayer as well."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the fragmentation of the rules on consumer rights creates a very significant obstacle to cross-border purchases and sales and is also a problem for the effective creation of a real internal market."
"I believe that the proposal for a directive, which was sent back to committee today with important additions, can contribute to mapping out a clear legal framework on consumer rights."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by revising the four current directives, this report aims to bring an end to a fragmentation of the legal framework that has so far hindered the completion of the internal market."
"The objective is to improve the functioning of the market for consumers and undertakings, boosting consumer confidence and reducing the reluctance of undertakings to operate at a cross-border level."
"The proposal is complex and contains many specific aspects which have been scrutinised and debated ever since France last held the rotating presidency."
"Under the new Commission headed by Mr Barroso, Mrs Reding's work has led to total harmonisation no longer being thought of as dogmatic and we have rightly started out on the road towards a more targeted harmonisation."
"Despite not being completely satisfied by the end result achieved - which I consider to be mediocre and the fruit of a poor compromise - I believe and I hope that this proposal can offer a starting-point for further developments."
"I therefore supported this report."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the text voted on today is the result of a long and complicated journey that began in October 2008 with the aim of putting the consumer at the heart of the protection offered for purchases made abroad."
"The objective that the Union and the EU institutions must set themselves is to help the internal market to function better, with the aim of increasing consumer confidence whilst at the same time supporting our businesses."
"The directive voted on today by this House represents the synthesis of four directives on this issue which were in force until today."
"The directive shows our desire to harmonise the regulations currently in force in the different legal systems in a much more incisive way, avoiding the legal fragmentation that unfortunately has very often ended up being a hindrance both to undertakings - whose aim is to be able to be competitive on the cross-border market - and to consumers."
"For these reasons, I consented to and voted in favour of this report."
"(FI) Mr President, the reform of the directive on consumer rights has been a long and sporadic process."
"The Commission's original idea for fullscale harmonisation threatened to impair levels of consumer protection, particular that of consumers in the Nordic countries."
"This would have been contrary to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, according to which consumer legislation must be based on levels of consumer protection that are as high as possible."
"We should therefore always remember that the markets are for consumers, and it is not the case that consumers are for the markets."
"Legislation on consumers and small entrepreneurs must always be as clear as possible and easy to understand."
"Legislation that is precisely and carefully drafted is in the interests of all parties."
"Accordingly, it is good that the directive is being referred back to committee, as Parliament today decided it should."
"(FI) Mr President, up until now the internal market of the European Union has been developed on the terms of mainly large companies."
"Now it is time to turn our attention to small and mediumsized enterprises and, above all, consumers, to ensure that their interests in the internal market are more vigorously protected."
"This Commission proposal to reform consumer protection has met with a fairly controversial reception."
"In Finland, for example, the Consumers' Association collected signatures on a petition, stating that the proposal, if it had gone ahead, would have harmed consumer protection in Finland irreparably."
"This compromise we have now voted on, which will go for further discussion, is very obscure."
"A large number of the original proposals have been cut out, with the result that it is in no way ambitious."
"The biggest problem, however, is that it is actually hard to understand."
"I would like to make it a condition that the directive on consumer rights should be one that consumers also understand, thus offering them protection."
"(FI) Mr President, my Finnish fellow Members who spoke before me, Mr Repo and Mrs Jäätteenmäki, expressed some welcome views regarding this directive on consumer rights."
"As Finns and Nordic people, we are worried that consumer protection might be impaired."
"Full harmonisation would mean just that, especially as far as the Nordic countries are concerned."
"Moreover, it would delay measures in those countries where things at present are hardly perfect."
"It is excellent that this proposal is being referred back to committee, because it contains certain slightly problematic points, particularly for small entrepreneurs."
"I would like the Committee to focus attention on one small issue."
"Amendments 18 and 107 suggest that this would have a very negative impact on travel companies in northern Finland, for example."
"Frequently a decision to go to a company, hotel or tourist accommodation is made on the road, and people call and book."
"Under this directive, that would not be enough: people would have to send a fax or something similar."
"This is not always possible in practice."
"This issue should be approached at the level of the public, and the different situations in the various Member States need to be understood."
"(DE) Mr President, I think the approach being taken to harmonise our fragmented European consumer law, which poses a barrier to trade, is a sound one and the right way to go."
"It is also important for consumers to be able to develop a sense of European law, in other words for it to be possible for them to be confident when they do business or when they buy or acquire something anywhere in the European Union."
"That will bring certainty not only for consumers, but also for producers."
"I am particularly pleased about the improvements in the information requirements for door-to-door selling and for distance contracts."
"In future debates - and I am therefore very pleased that this report has been referred back to committee once again - we should ensure that, when we talk about producers, we do not just consider the large corporations but also the small family businesses, and we should not overburden them with legal subtleties."
"Mr President, when my constituents ask me about the main benefit of being part of the European Union, my reply is always the free trade that exists between nations and the internal market that we are seeking to complete."
"I therefore welcome this consumer rights directive. I welcome it because it takes an - albeit small - step towards completing that single market."
"It will give some benefits to consumers and small businesses."
"It will assist in Internet and cross-border trade."
"However, I have to say that this directive has taken a long time to come about, and progress is modest."
"The plea that I would make to the Commission is that we need a framework for completing the single market, as opposed to the rather disconnected series of initiatives that we have at the moment."
"(ET) Mr President, the adoption of the harmonised European Consumer Rights Directive is certainly one way of improving the functioning of the internal market."
"This harmonised directive, which brings together a number of directives relating to consumer rights, will considerably simplify the legal framework, will undoubtedly help to increase consumer confidence, and of course will also encourage cross-border trade."
"This is a step towards reducing fragmentation."
"Unfortunately, the full harmonisation of consumer rights in the European Union is still not a reality today."
"Nevertheless, this is an important step towards better consumer protection and trade."
"I therefore supported the adoption of this document."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, news of the earthquake swarm that has been affecting the Far East and Japan in particular since 11 March has left us all astonished by the scale of the human tragedy that is unfolding."
"For these reasons, I think this resolution represents a necessary first step to guarantee the people of Japan all the humanitarian, technical and financial support they will need in the coming months and years."
"I believe that the incident at the Fukushima plant should force us all to reflect carefully, scrupulously and calmly on the risks of nuclear power."
"Europe must invest and must also direct the Member States to concentrate more closely and more effectively on alternative energy sources."
"Our thoughts go out to Japan today and our commitment for the future must be to avoid similar situations being repeated in Europe and elsewhere in the world."
"(DE) Mr President, I believe that we can all learn lessons from the situation in Japan."
"These lessons relate in particular to nuclear power stations."
"I call on the Council urgently to table proposals in this regard."
"What the Commission has so far presented provides an incentive for the European Council Atomic Questions Working Group finally to address the demands made by the European Parliament."
"We need an intensive debate on this issue, and I believe that the time has now come for this to happen."
"Written explanation of vote"
"I support this report, which once again points out that we should help Moldova to recover economically, taking into account that about 40% of its economy is dependent on agriculture."
"I completely agree with the measures proposed by the rapporteur in order to have an agreement that is more comprehensive and relevant to the economic recovery of this country, which is an EU partner."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this report which increases Moldova's duty free tariff quotas for wine."
"Moldova is experiencing difficulties related to wine exports, which poses a threat to its economic recovery and agriculture, in particular medium-sized and family farms."
"The agricultural sector accounts for around 40% of Moldova's economy."
"The wine sector alone employs approximately 300 000 people, most of whom live in rural areas."
"Hitherto Moldova has fully exhausted the quota it was allocated, therefore an increase in duty free tariff quotas will enable Moldova to increase sales of its production in the EU, without damaging the EU's wine industry."
"Russia is an important market outlet for Moldova's winemakers."
"However, recently, the Russian market is no longer a certainty for wine product exports."
"In its quest to find an alternative to the Russian market, the European Commission has proposed increasing duty-free quotas from 100 000 hectolitres (hl) to 150 000 hl this year, from 120 000 hl to 180 000 hl in 2012 and up to 240 000 hl from 2013."
"I voted for this amendment in trade relations with the Republic of Moldova in order to increase the volume of duty-free wine imports."
"This amendment to Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 may provide a solution for the Republic of Moldova's wine producers so that they can benefit from a more reliable market outlet, compared to when Russia imposed an embargo on Moldovan wines in 2006 and 2010, causing a number of winemakers to go bankrupt."
"in writing. - (PT) I abstained from voting on the proposal introducing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova as I believe that its current wording does not adequately address the necessary provisions for the protection of EU geographical indications (GIs), particularly the GI that relates to port wines."
"I would like to express my support for the economic recovery of Moldova and offer a positive outlook for the people who work in the country's wine industry."
"I agree with the increase in the duty free tariff quota for wine, from 120,000 hl to 180,000 hl for 2011, and from 2013 onwards to 240,000 hl per year."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report, which in no way jeopardises the EU wine industry."
"I voted for the report on introducing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova, given that this sends a positive signal from the EU to this country, a member of the Eastern Partnership, which recently stated that it hopes to be able to submit its application to join the European Union in 2011."
"Moldova has undertaken an ambitious set of political, economic and social reforms, which must be encouraged to continue."
"At the same time, the Republic of Moldova has been hit hard by the economic and financial crisis."
"During the last four years, 40% of its wine producers have either ceased trading or gone into liquidation, while the companies still operating in this key sector of its economy have accumulated losses."
"Increasing the duty-free tariff rate quota for wine and extending the validity of Council Regulation No 55/2008 until the end of 2015 would help this country where the number of workers in the wine industry has risen to 300 000 and the agricultural sector accounts for 40% of GDP, without affecting the Union's economy at the same time."
"These measures would also leave sufficient time to prepare the negotiations on creating an expanded, comprehensive free trade area, which is an objective shared by the EU and the Republic of Moldova."
"I voted in favour of this report as I believe that the Commission's proposal, which amends the regulation that is currently in force, may serve to support Moldova's economic recovery and provide a positive outlook for people working in the country's wine industry, without damaging the interests of EU producers."
"The Moldovan wine industry is going through a period of crisis sparked by the reduction in exports, which have set back its economic recovery and reforms that would enable it to aspire to EU integration in a more realistic way."
"The increase in the duty free tariff quota, particularly for Moldovan wine, may help to alleviate the pressure on this sector."
"I must stress that despite the EU's willingness to help Moldova, the Union and its Member States should seek to ensure that wine from other states does not have quality standards that are below those required for EU wines."
"in writing. - (PT) This draft legislative resolution by Parliament is based on a proposal for a regulation by Parliament and the Council which amends Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introducing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova."
"Despite the efforts being made by its people and the reforms implemented by its government, the Republic of Moldova is undergoing a difficult situation due to the crisis which the wine sector, the most productive sector in the country, is facing, as it represents 40% of Moldova's economy and employs more than a quarter of its working population."
"It is therefore important to support Moldova's economic recovery and give a positive sign of EU solidarity with a population that lives mostly in rural areas."
"I also welcome and am voting in favour of this draft legislative resolution to extend Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 until 31 December 2015, and I hope that a 'deep and comprehensive free trade area' will be set up between the EU and the Republic of Moldova by that date."
"This report approves a Commission proposal to authorise the increase in the duty free tariff quota for Moldovan wine."
"The Commission is proposing an increase in the quota from 100 000 hl to 150 000 hl in 2011, from 120 000 hl to 180 000 hl in 2012, and from 2013 onwards to 240 000 hl per year."
"According to the Commission, the proposed increases are based on the fact that Moldova has systematically exhausted the existing quote, and take into account 'the potential of the sector to improve its niche markets in the EU'."
"Although it has been stated that the proposed level of increase does not jeopardise the EU wine industry, we believe that there are still some doubts as to whether this is indeed the case, and that is why we have abstained."
"This consideration has taken account of the situation of crisis which many producers, particularly small and medium-sized producers, are currently facing in countries such as Portugal, with the dramatic drop in production prices and the incessant increases in input costs."
"These difficulties are exacerbated by changes introduced with the reform of the Common Market Organisation (CMO) and the planned aim of production rights."
"This reform has benefited large wine industry most of all, along with some importers..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Mr Moreira's report was adopted today, supporting a Commission proposal to authorise the increase in the duty free tariff quota for Moldovan wine."
"Although the Community's executive states that the level of increase does not jeopardise the EU wine industry, given that there is doubt, and in the interests of Portuguese agriculture, we have abstained from voting."
"Moldova has asked the Commission to increase its duty free tariff quota for wine under the autonomous trade preferences granted to the country in a 2008 regulation."
"In order to support Moldova's economic recovery and provide a positive outlook for people working in the wine industry in the country (one quarter of the workforce), there is a proposed increase in the duty free tariff quota for wine, from 100 000 hl to 150 000 hl for 2011, from 120 000 hl to 180 000 hl for 2012, and from 2013 onwards to 240 000 hl per year."
"The Commission states that 'as the general level of imports from Moldova is merely 0.04% of all EU imports, further market opening is not expected to create negative effects for the EU."
"Currently around 90% of all imports from Moldova...'"
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The Commission's proposal provides for a change to the regulations for relations with the Republic of Moldova."
"Given the period of crisis that the country in question is facing, the plan aims to increase the amount of wine imported from Moldova."
"According to the Commission, these imports would have a minimal impact on our markets and yet I do not feel that I can support the proposal in this current period of major economic crisis, which is already putting our farmers and wineries under serious pressure."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this document, because in order to support Moldova's economic recovery and provide the people working in the wine industry in Moldova with a positive outlook, it is proposed to increase the duty free tariff quota for wine for 2011 from 100,000 hectolitres (hl) to 150,000 hl, for 2012 from 120,000 hl to 180,000 hl, and from 2013 onwards to 240,000 hl per year."
"The level of the proposed increase is based on the fact that Moldova has systematically exhausted the existing quota and the potential of the sector to improve its niche markets in the EU."
"Moreover, the level of the increase does not destabilise the EU wine industry."
"It is expected that Moldova's wine sector will continue to improve the quality of its wines."
"As Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 expires on 31 December 2012, and as it is important to ensure legal certainty for producers, exporters and importers, it is proposed to extend the validity of Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 for another three years to 31 December 2015."
"in writing. - I will always declare that the Republic of Moldova has to be encouraged in its pro-European path."
"Moldova is experiencing difficulties with its wine exports to some of its traditional markets, which threaten its economic recovery and the reform process that it is vigorously pursuing."
"The arguments given in Vital Moreira's report are convincing, Moldova needs Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 to be extended for a further three years, until 31 of December 2015."
"The request made by the Republic of Moldova in July 2010 is justified."
"Moldova needs the European Union to be a trustworthy partner."
"For these reasons, I endorse the report drafted by Vital Moreira on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament"
"in writing. - (DE) The trade preferences granted to the Republic of Moldova by the EU have proven to be appropriate."
"Furthermore, no damaging effects on the EU wine industry have been recorded."
"As the poorest country in Europe, the Republic of Moldova needs the support of the EU."
"This is our moral duty in the interests of European unity and harmony."
"I therefore welcome the Commission's proposal to extend the period of validity."
"in writing. - I voted for this report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introducing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova."
"This brings our trade relations with Moldova into line with other neighbouring countries."
"in writing. - (IT) In the context of the Union's neighbourhood policy, Moldova has always adopted an ambitious programme of political association and increasing economic integration with the EU, thereby making decisive progress towards convergence of its own laws with EU legislation and regulations ahead of the preparation for future, more extensive negotiations."
"Moldova has shown that it is ready to promote and bear the effects of such an ambitious undertaking, continuing along the lines of the progress already made in terms of the free EU market."
"We do however agree with the rapporteur, Mr Moreira, when he says that the Republic of Moldova is currently in a difficult situation over the export of some products, with consequent problems for its economic recovery."
"We therefore believe it is necessary to extend the validity of the regulation on some autonomous trade preferences by three years so as to give Moldova enough time to adequately prepare for the negotiations on the free trade area."
"Beginning with these considerations, the report that we have adopted aims to encourage Moldova's economic recovery, in particular by increasing the tariff quota exempt from duties of some products subject to current autonomous trade preferences."
"in writing. - (PT) Moldova has been making efforts in recent years to move ever closer towards European standards of freedom, democracy and good governance."
"The efforts highlighted here have been consistent and have demonstrated Moldova's concern with continuing on the route towards possible enlargement."
"Thus, in order to support Moldova's economic recovery and provide a positive perspective for people working in the wine industry in the country (one quarter of the workforce), there is a proposed increase in the duty free tariff quota for wine, from 100 000 hl to 150 000 hl for 2011, from 120 000 hl to 180 000 hl for 2012, and from 2013 onwards to 240 000 hl per year."
"This is the direction which the amendments to this regulation are taking, and this will help the Moldovan economy and its development."
"in writing. - Given that Moldova is experiencing difficulties with its wine exports to some of its traditional markets, which threaten its economic recovery and the reform process that it is vigorously pursuing, and in order to take measures to increase Moldova's wine exports to support its economic development, it is necessary to: 1. increase the duty-free tariff quota for wine under the autonomous trade preferences; 2. extend the validity of the relevant regulation (which is due to expire on 31 December 2012) for another three years, until 31 December 2015; 3. increase the duty-free tariff quota for wheat, barley and maize."
"I therefore voted 'for'."
"in writing. - (RO) I welcome the vote in favour of this report."
"The Republic of Moldova needs the European Union's support at this juncture when it is facing economic problems, like most countries in the world, but also problems intrinsic to political transition."
"At a time when Moldova is virtually facing a boycott of its wine exports in the Russian Federation's market, increasing the duty-free tariff rate quota for wine is a timely measure and one which, I hope, will benefit this country's economy."
"in writing. - (LT) I agree with this resolution which proposes increasing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova in the wine sector, which is vitally important for this country."
"It is noted that this would be an even greater incentive to enhance mutual relations between the European Union and Moldova, and to develop the European neighbourhood policy."
"As hitherto Moldova has fully exhausted the quota set, I agree with the proposal to increase the duty free tariff quota for wine."
"Attention is drawn to the fact that such regulation will not have a negative impact on the EU's wine industry."
"Moldova is one of Europe's poorest countries, facing major economic and political problems."
"The EU should create favourable conditions for Moldova to choose an appropriate geopolitical direction that would help address the country's difficulties."
"Furthermore, the provisions of this resolution will create favourable conditions for the Moldovan wine sector to improve the quality of its product."
"I believe that it is reasonable to extent the validity of the entire regulation for another three years, to ensure legal clarity and certainty for producers, exporters and importers."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Moreira on autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova because it is consistent with the Union's neighbourhood policy and the economic agreements already in place with other bordering countries."
"Indeed, I think it is a good idea for the countries bordering the EU to receive reciprocal trade concessions, both for economic development and socio-political issues."
"The free movement of goods or a reduced customs duty allow a greater flow of capital and facilitate cooperation agreements."
"This will benefit bordering countries as well as the internal market."
"Clearly, its commercial purpose is important, however in doing this it is important not to forget other aspects that must be kept under consideration."
"As I had the chance to say earlier, it is vital that the EU has a coherent and effective European neighbourhood policy."
"Within the scope of this neighbourhood policy, Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introduces a specific system of autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova, which provides free access to the EU market for all products from Moldova, with the exception of certain agricultural products listed in its annex, for which limited concessions have been given either in the form of exemption from customs duties within the limit of tariff quotas, or in the form of lower customs duties."
"One of the exceptions to free movement is focused on the wine industry, with the implementation of a tariff quota that, according to the available data, has been fully used up months before the end of the year."
"Given the fact that the economy of Moldova is being heavily hit by the negative effects of the global financial and economic crisis, and that its wine sector employs about 300 000 workers, this report, which I voted for, proposes the increase of the current tariff quota for wine in order to support Moldova's efforts and to provide an attractive and viable market for its wine exports, which, moreover, do not compete with Portuguese products."
"In order to support Moldova's efforts at economic recovery and encourage the movement that has been seen towards convergence with EU legislation and standards, the Commission has put forward a proposal to increase the tariff quota for Moldovan wine."
"According to the Commission, this measure will not have any negative effects on the European wine industry, so I felt that it was worth supporting the granting of this aid to Moldova."
"in writing. - The text of the report is short."
"It says: 'The European Parliament, - having regard to the Commission proposal to Parliament and the Council, - having regard to Article 294(2) and Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, pursuant to which the Commission submitted the proposal to Parliament (C7-0364/2010), - having regard to Article 294(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, - having regard to Rule 55 and 46(1) of its Rules of Procedure, - having regard to the report of the Committee on International Trade, 1."
"The Republic of Moldova is going through a difficult period in terms of its wine exports, which is having a negative effect on the process of reform and economic recovery being undertaken by its government."
"The wine sector provides work for around 300 000 people (a quarter of the active population of the country) who mostly live in rural areas, cultivating small or medium-sized family plots."
"With these changes, I think that Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 can contribute to supporting Moldova's economic recovery, providing workers in the country's wine sector with better prospects for the period 2011-2013."
"In order to achieve the best possible neighbourhood policy it will now be important to pursue tariff preferences, with the aim of halting the decline of Moldova's economy whilst at the same time reducing fiscal losses for the EU as much as possible."
"I am in favour of this report, given the amendments that were introduced in order to extend the validity of the current system - the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) - until December 2013, taking into account the uncertainty as to the time required to complete the current legislative process."
"The adoption of this report thus avoids a break in the legal coverage of the GSP and prevents disparities in treatment between different countries."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report since the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is a highly important trade and development mechanism that the EU has at hand."
"However, I would like to urge the Commission to come up with a more substantial review of the GSP scheme as soon as possible."
"I also think it is time for us to engage in a more substantial review of the GSP and GSP+ beneficiaries' lists."
"The European Parliament should be consulted on this issue from the earliest stage."
"I also expect that Parliament will be involved in the process of monitoring whether the GSP+ beneficiaries uphold the 27 ILO and UN conventions, something that must be scrutinised thoroughly in order to maintain the reliability of the GSP+ mechanism."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report."
"In 1968, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) recommended the creation of a Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) under which industrialised countries would grant trade preferences to all developing countries on a non-reciprocal basis, not just to former colonies."
"The European Community was the first to implement a GSP scheme in 1971 and it has been one of the key EU trade and development policy instruments to help developing countries reduce poverty by generating revenue through international trade."
"The GSP scheme applied by the EU offers the most favourable treatment, granting the least-developed countries duty-free and quota-free access to the EU's market."
"This system also helps promote sustainable development and good governance for developing countries ratifying and implementing international conventions and protocols on human and labour rights, environmental protection, drugs and the fight against corruption."
"In 1968, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development recommended the creation of a Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) under which industrialised countries would grant trade preferences to all developing countries on a non-reciprocal basis."
"The European Community was the first to implement a GSP scheme and since its creation the GSP has been one of the key EU trade and development policy instruments to assist developing countries reduce poverty by generating revenue through international trade."
"Although the system is the most used of the industrialised countries' systems, I agree that we need to review the regulation in question so as to simplify the application of the scheme."
"Additionally, I think that the general review should be dealt with in the proposal for a new regulation, which I hope will be tabled without delay."
"The new proposal must aim at making the GSP a clearer and more transparent system."
"I should also like to call on the Commission to look at the possibility of checking that the commitments have been fulfilled by periodically carrying out investigations that would also involve Parliament and representatives of civil society in the country in question."
"in writing. - (BG) I voted for this report because I think that the impact of the present system needs to be increased and the use of the Generalised System of Preferences improved by providing technical assistance specifically designed to create the institutional and regulatory capacity required to allow the countries most in need to take maximum advantage of the benefits of international trade and the system of preferences."
"Assistance must also be provided with the effective implementation of the international conventions required by this scheme and with the fulfilment of their commitments."
"I think that developing countries must offer assistance in the battle against poverty by generating revenue through international trade."
"This is the system most widely used among such systems available to the developed countries."
"I think that it must be extended in order to achieve legal certainty and guarantee the interests of both the EU and the beneficiary countries."
"However, during that time, the current unsatisfactory situation should be resolved without delay, accompanied by constant efforts to find a way of assisting the weaker countries which are in need."
"I decided to vote for the report on generalised tariff preferences as it proposed the immediate adaptation of the 'Generalised System of Preferences' to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, as well as a general review of the scheme in the future."
"This general review would be aimed at increasing the involvement of beneficiary countries in the reform processes which affect them, granting technical assistance to help develop their institutional capacity, as well as at reviewing and harmonising the rules of origin."
"in writing. - (FR) Parliament has just agreed to extend the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) for developing countries to run from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2013."
"The GSP scheme is due to be reviewed this year, a process that should take into account the concerns expressed in the Committee on International Trade."
"We are calling for greater transparency and genuine cooperation during the GSP negotiations with each country."
"Commissioner De Gucht has undertaken to ensure that the European Parliament is closely involved in the decision-making process."
"He must now keep that promise."
"in writing. - (PT) The current regulation which establishes the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) will expire by the end of this year."
"However, since the Commission is still awaiting the conclusion of a study on the matter, so as to present a new proposal for the GSP, in order to avoid a legal vacuum it was decided to extend the existing regulation and its current arrangements for another two years."
"However, the Commission needs to present a legislative initiative on this subject very soon, because the current system needs to be reviewed and made more effective as a matter of urgency."
"I therefore endorse the main points highlighted by the rapporteur, to be reviewed in this legislative proposal by the Commission."
"These propose an effective system that will respond better to the interests of the recipient countries and economic operators, and rules that provide for a reform process which ensures the participation of the recipients and which will also ensure that Parliament can carry out its task of democratic oversight."
"in writing. - (PT) In 1968 the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) recommended the creation of a Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) under which countries that were considered to be more developed would support developing countries by granting trade preferences."
"The European Community was the first to implement a GSP scheme in 1971."
"This has proved to be one of the key methods for cooperation at the level of international trade with developing countries, by reducing poverty."
"The current regulation needs to be updated as it is due to lapse and as it is not covered in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It also requires substantial reform."
"Although this proposal does not yet constitute a new regulation, the drafting of which is necessary, I would like to express my agreement with the report under discussion, and I hope that the Commission will submit a new proposal as soon as possible, so that the EU can continue to support developing countries."
"The Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is a trade mechanism which allows the EU to grant developing countries preferential, non-reciprocal access to its market through tariff reductions."
"While it is defined as a tool for development aid, this mechanism is not free of contradictions, especially between some of its stated purposes and the results that are actually obtained."
"In effect, many developing countries have become increasingly economically dependent and have been shaping their economies according to a model of reduced diversification, based on a limited set of products for export, instead of developing their internal markets."
"An international division of labour has become ingrained."
"This is unfavourable to these countries; it is often the large multinationals, some of them European, that reap the greatest benefits from this system."
"There needs to be a comprehensive review of this mechanism, along with a thorough discussion of its various aspects and complexities and their impact not only on developing countries, but also on the EU Member States, particularly the weakest."
"Given the Commission's delay in submitting a new proposal for regulation, which means that it cannot enter into force immediately after the term of the existing regulation, there needs to be an extension of the existing..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The current scheme of generalised tariff preferences expires at the end of this year, so this is simply about voting for the necessary extension in order to ensure legal certainty and the mutual interests of the approximately 150 countries involved."
"However, the importance of this subject for both developing countries and EU Member States with weaker economies, whose industrial, agricultural or social interests are not always respected in the international trade agreements promoted by the Commission, makes it necessary to conduct a thorough discussion on the new regulation."
"The Commission should submit the proposal for this as soon as possible so as to allow all the different aspects and complexities of the Generalised System of Preferences to be properly analysed, along with its impact on different areas and countries."
"in writing. - (IT) The Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) has been one of the key EU trade and development policy instruments to assist developing countries to reduce poverty."
"This measure prolongs the current situation since a new regulation has not been tabled, which is somewhat regrettable."
"Despite this, considering the importance of the instrument under discussion, I will vote in favour."
"in writing. - (DE) Trade is an important and efficient instrument for combating poverty in developing countries."
"The transitional regulation on a scheme of generalised tariff preferences legally enshrines preferential access to the EU market for 176 developing countries."
"I supported the regulation, which ensures legal continuity, so that opportunities for trade remain available to developing countries."
"Moreover, it is the EU's moral duty to support these countries in the development of democracy and the rule of law by enabling fair trade."
"The resolution on the proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 applying a system of generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011 was adopted by a wide majority in this House."
"If the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) were not extended, many developing countries could actually find themselves in hugely difficult situations."
"Ever since 1971, Europe has tried to support and assist developing countries in order to reduce poverty by generating revenue through international trade."
"Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the procedure to change the GSP requires the intervention of the Council and of Parliament, which must pursue the creation of an effective system that is sensitive to the interests of the beneficiary countries whilst also requiring them to ratify and implement 27 international conventions on the protection of human rights, sustainable development, fundamental labour standards and good governance."
"Despite my support for this proposal for an extension valid until 2011, I feel I must emphasise the regret - which was also expressed by my group - over the Commission's tardiness in dealing with this bill."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report which is a technical rollover to the GSP regulation."
"It extends the duration of the regulation until 31 December 2013 in order to allow sufficient time for the new regulation to be drafted by the Commission and for Parliament to exercise its new powers in international trade policy."
"This report is therefore not intended to tackle the substance of the regulation and it does not comment on whether GSP+ beneficiaries do in fact continue to qualify for these trade preferences on the basis of good governance, sustainable development and ratification and implementation of UN conventions in the field of social, environmental and human rights."
"We are all convinced that since its creation the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) has been one of the key European Union trade and development policy instruments."
"It has represented a major incentive for developing countries, long embroiled in the fight against poverty, to favour free access to their market and imports of their goods via tariff reductions."
"However, we agree with the rapporteur, Mr Scholz, who has expressed hope that the current Regulation on the subject will need to be extended, since this would ensure legal certainty and guarantee the interests of both the EU and the beneficiary countries and also avoid the current situation (which is still unsatisfactory) being extended."
"So far we have seen a certain underuse of the trade preferences guaranteed by the GSP, above all those related to the rules of origin, caused by a problem in the administrative procedures that characterise them."
"It would therefore be advisable to provide targeted technical assistance, for instance by operating twinning programmes, with the principal aim of promoting the development of regulatory capacities and guaranteeing the proper transposition of the international conventions."
"Finally, we are of the opinion that the Commission should carry out constant monitoring, with greater involvement from Parliament and the relevant social partners."
"in writing. - (PT) The existing regulation on generalised tariff preferences expires at the end of this year."
"Given the impossibility of a new regulation coming into force in due time because of the delay in the submission of the study requested by the committee, we are obliged to extend the existing regulation for two more years."
"However, given the importance of this regulation for governing trade between developing countries and the EU, the Commission needs to submit a new, updated version very soon."
"There can be no development without economic growth."
"Yet as I have said before, in the absence of an impartial state, economic growth is no guarantee of development."
"EU trade policy has an essential part to play in combating poverty and achieving the Millenium Development Goals."
"The EU's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is one of the tools that enables developing countries to compete on the international markets by offering either reduced customs duties or zero-rate access to the EU market for their exports."
"The GSP also releases countries from dependency on aid."
"We have approved the extension of the current regulation while we await the new draft regulation that has been requested in order to guarantee legal certainty."
"However, the European Parliament's new powers in the field of trade following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon must be taken into account."
"Under the Treaty, measures in the GSP Regulation are considered to be delegated acts, which means that the European Parliament will have greater supervisory powers in future."
"in writing. - (DE) As long ago as 1964, some developing countries were already calling loudly for trade preferences in order to improve their economic situation. In 1968, after an agreement was reached, a Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) was introduced."
"The European Economic Community introduced the GSP in 1971 and other nations like the United States followed suit."
"The temporary granting of trade preferences sought to achieve the following goals: an increase in developing countries' export proceeds by diversification of the exported products, promotion of industrialisation and an acceleration of economic growth in the developing countries."
"Furthermore, the GSP was intended to ensure that the products supported originated in developing countries."
"To date, the GSP represents one of the most important EU instruments in the area of trade and it is monitored by the European Commission."
"As the current scheme expires on 31 December of this year, the Commission already presented a new proposal back in May 2010."
"No amendments are proposed for the new regulation, although the rapporteur definitely believes that a redrafting of the schemes is necessary."
"I am abstaining from the vote because there do not seem to be any new, tangible proposals for the new regulation."
"The regulation currently in force for generalised tariff preferences that enable free trade or lower duties in the trade of products between Member States and third countries, a regulation which is generally used to encourage trade with poor and/or developing countries, needs to be changed and put back into place, given its forthcoming expiry."
"I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a new regulation on this subject because I agree with the objectives of the changes it aims to bring in."
"The amendment aims to create an effective system that is more sensitive to the interests of the beneficiary countries and economic operators, to develop more comprehensive rules and to guarantee Parliament's role as the body of democratic control."
"I hope that this is the first step towards a solution to be identified at a global level for a general agreement on trade."
"After the failure of the Doha negotiations, these measures can only really be provisional, ahead of a more long-term solution."
"Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 established a Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) that is valid until 31 December 2011."
"The GSP has been one of the EU's main trade and development policy instruments for helping developing countries to reduce poverty, by generating income through international trade."
"Parliament's consultation process with regard to the latest GSP was insufficient, and did not allow for wide-ranging negotiation."
"Parliament emphasised that in future more time will be needed for it to carry out its functions."
"On 26 May 2010, the Commission proposed simply extending the period of application of the current regulation, claiming that there was not enough time to table a new regulation."
"This proposed extension did not take into account the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Parliament raised this failure and proposed amendments to the Commission's draft, with a view to ensuring that the rights and powers that Parliament had acquired through the Treaty of Lisbon would be respected."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report, which approves the extension of the regulation in question and amends the elements required for respecting the new powers acquired by Parliament in the light of the Treaty of Lisbon, in particular guaranteeing new powers with regard to delegated acts."
"Under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) industrialised countries guarantee trade preferences to all developing countries on a non-reciprocal basis."
"It is one of the key EU trade and development policy instruments to assist developing countries to reduce poverty by generating revenue through international trade."
"The regulation currently in force and valid until 31 December 2012 does not respect the new powers granted to Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The new proposal for a regulation aims to create a system that is more sensitive to the interests of the beneficiary countries and economic operators, to develop more rules that allow for a better regulated reform process and to ensure that the regulation gives due importance to the task of democratic control asked of Parliament."
"For these reasons I voted in favour of the proposal for a new regulation that aims for greater clarity and transparency in the GSP system."
"in writing. - (PT) Since 1971, the European Union has been awarding preferential trade arrangements to developing countries within the framework of its Generalised System of Preferences (GSP)."
"The GSP is applied through successive regulations implementing a system of generalised tariff-related preferences, generally for three years at a time."
"The current system was instituted by Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 and applies until 31 December 2011, when it will be replaced by a new regulation, yet to be drawn up."
"However, the remaining period of application of Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 is not sufficient to allow a Commission proposal to be drawn up and a new regulation to be adopted by means of the Ordinary legislative procedure, so it would appear necessary to extend this regulation's period of application until 31 December 2013, in order to ensure continuity in the functioning of the system."
"I voted in favour, in the expectation that the Commission will table a new proposal quickly, which would contribute to making the GSP a clearer, more transparent and more effective system."
"in writing. - The idea of a Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) goes back to 1968, when tariffs were much higher in general and when they were still seen as the main barrier to trade from developing to industrialised countries."
"The concept was initially proposed by the UNCTAD as a development tool: industrialised countries should grant non-reciprocal trade preferences to developing countries, allowing them to generate revenue not via aid, but via international preferential trade."
"The European Community started to apply this scheme in 1971."
"The first three-year scheme was implemented from 2006 to 2008."
"The second scheme is due to expire on 31 December 2011."
"The current scheme was adopted in 2008 under the consultation procedure."
"However, at that time, the referral arrived in Parliament at very short notice. Meaningful Parliament involvement in the regulation was impossible."
"This should not happen again for the forthcoming regulation, in particular given Parliament's new competencies under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I voted in favour of the text of this resolution because I think that the European Union's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is one of the key instruments to make it easier for developing countries to achieve growth."
"For this very reason it must be put into practice without delay."
"As far back as 1971, the European Union stood out from the other economic powers as it was the first to establish a preferential tariff system for developing countries."
"The main aim is to eradicate endemic poverty everywhere, enabling countries in difficulty to draw the greatest benefits from international trade."
"Now the tariff agreement is close to expiry and the Commission has decided that the new proposal will be tabled in the coming months, though its entry into force will be delayed until at least the second half of 2012."
"This delay will result in a legal vacuum of more than six months, causing a discontinuity in the programme that even risks putting the many results already achieved under threat."
"I hope that this lamented delay will not cause the use of the generalised tariff system to decline and that the new agreement will provide a stimulus for the implementation of a global trade system based on ethics and democracy."
"in writing. - (LT) It is very important for the EU's Generalised System of Preferences to become more transparent."
"It is important for the EU's tariff preferences for imports from third countries to be based on democracy and ethics, and not simply the pursuit of profit."
"Tariff preferences should be beneficial to the whole of society and not just a certain number of companies."
"The rapporteur accurately observed that the proposal to extend the current regulation is not ideal, but it would allow us to avoid a legal vacuum lasting more than six months."
"Under the current regulation, the European Parliament has no say on the criteria for eligibility, or on the list of the beneficiary countries."
"This should change: The time has come for Parliament to make use of its new post-Lisbon powers in the trade arena."
"The EU should pay more attention to the development of cooperation with neighbouring countries in the area of trade policy."
"This would help establish a stable and liberal business environment and would facilitate the gradual enlargement of the European single market."
"It is in the EU's interests to sign a free trade agreement with Ukraine and begin negotiations with other Eastern Partnership countries which are members of the World Trade Organisation - Georgia, Moldova and Armenia."
"in writing. - (DE) I have voted against this report."
"As the rapporteur himself states, the system in its current form has more than a few shortcomings."
"Although the Commission was called on to table a proposal for a new regulation which would, on the one hand, address the inadequacies of the legal framework and, on the other, take account of the institutional changes since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, ensuring among other things that Parliament is given greater powers of scrutiny than it has under the procedure that is currently applied, the draft that has been tabled contains an unnecessary extension of the current unsatisfactory situation."
"In the parliamentary report, the rapporteur also discusses some of his proposals for improvements which could or should be included in the future proposal for a new regulation."
"The Commission should take these proposals on board and table a new, improved regulation without delay."
"I am voting for this report, given that the combined air space of the US and the EU represents 60% of global air traffic, and current bilateral agreements between Member States and the US do not reflect reality."
"The opening up of air space between the US and EU on a non-discriminatory basis should provide improved services for the transportation of passengers and cargo, economic benefits, and above all jobs."
"I would therefore say that this is beneficial, as a convergence regulation could promote free competition, particularly with regard to state subsidies, and social and environmental criteria."
"The US and European aviation markets represent over half of the world's air traffic."
"Consequently, in view of global warming, the European Union and the United States need to work together to reduce the environmental impact of international aviation."
"I have therefore voted in favour of the Agreement in which both parties undertake to adopt environmental and social standards that will considerably reduce noise pollution and mitigate the effects of air traffic emissions on air quality, whilst also committing to developing sustainable alternative fuels."
"For the first time, both parties have also agreed to guarantee the social rights of airline staff."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this Protocol to amend the EU-US air transport agreement."
"The Protocol contains important elements of progress in EU-US cooperation on air transport issues."
"It also avoids the risk that, in the absence of such an agreement, someone might trigger the suspension clause, contained in the first-stage Agreement."
"Suspension could lead to European passengers and airlines losing the significant gains that have been enjoyed since March 2008."
"Attention should also be drawn to the fact that this new Agreement has opened the way to opportunities in terms of additional investment and market access as well as strengthening cooperation in regulatory areas such as safety, security and the environment, where both sides agreed a dedicated Joint Statement on the Environment."
"The EU Member States and the US account for a share of 60% of global aviation markets."
"We should therefore strive to ensure a steady increase in the quality of services in this area."
"By agreeing to the conclusion of an air transport Agreement between the EU and the United States, we are contributing to the growth of the aviation sector by making it possible to attract greater investment on both sides of the Atlantic."
"Furthermore, the Agreement will help to strengthen the protection of employee rights within the sector, step up cooperation on air travel safety and also, thanks to the compatibility requirement, strengthen cooperation on environmental matters."
"It is also significant that the role of the EU-US Joint Committee is strengthened, by enabling it to promote new initiatives when putting the Agreement into effect."
"I believe that the new Agreement will help further to open up access to the market, which will mean higher-quality services and more stringent safety requirements, and I therefore endorse the resolution."
"in writing. - (ES) I voted in favour of this initiative because air transport markets represent 60% of world traffic."
"This Agreement will bring about the changes in United States legislation that are necessary for increasing convergence on regulations preventing unfair competition."
"New routes will be opened, and operators and passengers will be offered improved services and prices, which will, in turn, contribute to economic growth, leading to job creation on both sides of the Atlantic."
"Although far from perfect, the EU-US Air Transport Agreement marks a step forward, paving the way not only for future opportunities in terms of additional investment and market access, but also for measures providing increased safety and security."
"The air transport market has not been completely opened up by both sides as a result of the version of the Agreement reached through negotiation."
"However, it contains sufficient incentives to encourage reform."
"The US needs to change its domestic legislation to allow EU investors majority ownership of US airlines, generating reciprocal measures from the EU."
"The EU-US Joint Committee has received increased powers, which means that it will be able to enhance cooperation by promoting new initiatives."
"The new rules will reduce red tape, including through mutual recognition of each other's regulatory decisions, and avoid the wasteful duplication of resources."
"The recognition of the importance of the social dimension and the responsibility given to the Joint Committee to monitor the social effects of the Agreement and develop appropriate responses as necessary are an innovation introduced in the second stage of the Agreement."
"in writing. - (PT) I welcome the fact that the European Union and the United States have declared their intention of working together to reduce the impact of international aviation on the environment."
"I applaud the initiatives for reducing noise, for reducing the impact of aviation on air quality and the global climate, for encouraging the development of environmentally friendly aviation technology, and for innovation with regard to air traffic management, and for the sustainable development of alternative aviation fuels."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of this recommendation, as I believe that the Agreement under consideration may be an important step towards opening up the market to EU and US airlines on a non-discriminatory basis."
"This opening up of the market may contribute to the improvement of services provided to passengers, in terms of both variety and cost, and provide substantial economic benefits."
"in writing. - (PT) Although it has not yet achieved a single transatlantic market for air transport, the amendment to the Air Transport Agreement between the United States and the European Union contains significant improvements compared to the previous version, particularly in terms of the environment and security."
"I hope that the progress made will enable continued efforts towards reducing the obstacles to creating this market, particularly with regard to the inter-operability and compatibility of systems, and the imbalance in competition laws, which favour US firms in terms of the ownership and control of airlines, not least the Fly America Act."
"in writing. - (PT) This draft legislative resolution is based on the draft decision of the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council on the conclusion of the Protocol to Amend the Air Transport Agreement between the United States of America, of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part."
"The ideal agreement would be one that proposed a complete opening up of the aviation market, without any restrictions on either side."
"However, this objective has not been achieved."
"Therefore, taking into account the regulatory changes due to the Treaty of Lisbon, the size of the aviation markets within the EU and the US, which account for 60% of global air traffic, the need to respect the privacy of European and US citizens, and the existence of rules ensuring respect for the rights of passengers, I welcome this Agreement."
"It represents significant progress compared with the status quo."
"However, it is important to emphasise the need for the European Parliament and the United States Congress to maintain dialogue on issues not covered by this Agreement."
"in writing. - (PT) The objectives of this Agreement are set out clearly by the rapporteur: the 'opening of the market': in other words, the deepening of the liberalisation under way within this sector, 'creating a single market for air transport'."
"It should be stressed, as pointed out by the rapporteur, that the aviation markets of the EU and the US together represent around 60% of global air traffic."
"The promises of benefits for workers and passengers that always accompany these liberalisation processes are as old and trite as they are false, as demonstrated by the reality in cases where liberalisation has gone ahead, whether in this sector or in other sectors."
"Propaganda relating to 'environmental cooperation' has now been added to these promises; a question that can and must be tackled without doubt, but not within this context."
"Even here, it is clear what the intention is: promoting the compatibility and interaction of emission licence-trading regimes."
"In the name of free competition, which justifies everything and to which everything is subject, severe limitations are being placed on state intervention in defence of the interests of national airlines, and therefore in defence of national strategic interests in a number of areas, such as links with migrant communities."
"These agreements are another part of the process of liberalisation under way within the air transport sector, which obstructs state intervention in and regulation of this strategic sector, opening the door to the monopolistic concentration that always results from free competition, which is sacrosanct and defended at all cost."
"In the name of facilitating business opportunities within international air transport, which promotes the interests of multinationals within the sector at the expense of national companies and their respective strategic interests, including those that are publicly owned, as is the case in Portugal with TAP Portugal."
"As a result, aviation company workers lose out, passengers lose out, and other workers lose out, as liberalisation facilitates dumping by multinationals, imposing unsecure jobs through the levelling down of working conditions."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this document, because the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, extended the circumstances in which Parliament's consent was required for the conclusion of an international agreement."
"Air agreements now fall within this category because they cover a field to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies."
"The EU-US aviation markets account for about 60% of world air traffic."
"Opening the market to EU and US airlines on a non-discriminatory basis would offer passengers and freight operators improved services, in terms of both variety and cost, provide substantial economic benefits and create jobs."
"Regulatory convergence could do much to promote fair competition, particularly with regard to state subsidies, social and environmental standards."
"While the second-stage Agreement represents a significant step forward, it is important for it not to be regarded as the end of the process of establishing a transatlantic aviation market."
"I believe that the Commission needs to look forward towards negotiating another stage of this Agreement covering issues including: further liberalisation of traffic rights; additional foreign investment opportunities; the effect of environmental measures and infrastructure constraints on the exercise of traffic rights; and better coordination of passenger rights policies in order to ensure the highest possible level of protection for passengers."
"Consistent standards of passenger rights, including those for people of reduced mobility, are of particular importance so as to avoid travellers facing inconsistent treatment while travelling."
"All of these air agreements are beneficial and necessary for the European Union, our airlines and our citizens."
"in writing. - I voted for this Agreement, which is correct in so far as it goes."
"However, while the incentives to further market opening are welcome, the absence of substantive progress in removing outdated regulatory constraints in the area of foreign investment is disappointing, as this will maintain the current unbalanced restrictions on foreign ownership and control in the United States."
"In addition, EU carriers will only gain limited access to US Government-financed traffic."
"This again represents the continuation of an unbalanced situation, given that EU national governments do not impose similar restrictions."
"This amendment to the Agreement on air transport between the European Union and the United States represents an excellent opportunity to develop the potential of a market that accounts for 60% of world air traffic."
"The European Commission has by now made significant progress in the attempt to establish an Open Aviation Area between the EU and the US, in which investments could flow freely and both EU and US airlines would be able to provide air services without any restriction."
"We now recognise the need for more intense cooperation in order to face up to ever-changing challenges in the fields of security and the environment, as well as to promote further investment in order to guarantee free access to the market."
"The provision of an EU-US Joint Committee is crucial: it will monitor the social impact of the regulatory cooperation programme, which will help reduce existing red tape."
"We would mention the problematic issue of exchanging personal passenger data between the EU and the US, and therefore the relationship between international security and the privacy of citizens."
"We consider it essential that Parliament be kept fully informed about the work of the Joint Committee, foreign investments, infrastructure constraints on the exercise of traffic rights and the coordination of passenger rights policies."
"The EU-US Agreement is very important for the future of relations between both sides."
"As such, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament needs to be fully informed and consulted with regard to the work carried out by the Joint Committee, as well as all of the entities involved."
"Any agreement that is to be concluded will need to be adopted by Parliament, which will therefore need to be kept up-to-date with all negotiations, and it will be important in the future for regular meetings to be held between Members of this House and members of the US Congress, in order to debate all questions relating to aviation policy between the EU and the US."
"This Agreement is therefore an important step towards opening up the market to airlines from the EU and the US without any discrimination."
"This opening up of the market may contribute to the improvement of services provided to passengers."
"in writing. - (NL) The delegation of the Dutch Labour Party to the European Parliament certainly does not consider this second stage Agreement to be perfect, but it takes the view that it will lead to progress in important areas."
"In addition, it will prevent the United States from activating the suspension clause in the absence of such an Agreement."
"Suspension could lead to European passengers and airlines no longer being able to profit from the significant benefits which they have enjoyed since March 2008 thanks to this protocol."
"The benefits and positive aspects include, in particular, agreements on working standards for airline staff, sharing good practice with regard to noise abatement, strengthening cooperation in the field of environmental protection etc. The delegation of the Dutch Labour Party to the European Parliament recognises the ongoing need to pursue a proper debate on safety requirements (such as the use of scanners) and the impact on privacy and health of passengers of such requirements."
"In addition, it would highlight the need for the privacy of European and US citizens to be put centre stage and respected when passengers' personal data is exchanged between the EU and the US."
"It is essential that Parliament is and remains involved in these negotiations and that European regulations are not eroded."
"in writing. - The Agreement is not perfect but does herald some serious progress."
"If there is no such Agreement, someone might trigger the suspension clause, which would deprive the EU's passengers and airlines of the significant gains that have been enjoyed since March 2008."
"Given the fact that US is a difficult partner in negotiations we should aspire for progress in further negotiations in this direction."
"I therefore voted 'for'."
"in writing. - (DE) Air transport has increased in general and therefore the aviation markets of the EU and the United States have also grown."
"For a long time, the Member States have negotiated with the United States on an individual basis and concluded bilateral agreements."
"The shift to EU level enables European airlines to fly to any destination in the United States from any point in the EU."
"As a precondition for this, some reforms had to be carried out both in the United States and in the European Union."
"The new Agreement is intended to open the way to future opportunities in terms of additional investment and market access and improve cooperation between the regulatory authorities."
"However, the agreement is one-sided if existing restrictions on foreign ownership and control in the United States continue to remain."
"Thus, with this new agreement, the EU is allowing itself once again to be deceived by the United States, and that is something that I cannot support."
"in writing. - (DE) It makes perfect sense for air transport agreements with the United States to now be concluded at European level instead of separately with individual Member States as they were previously."
"This will allow European airlines to fly to all destinations within the United States."
"What I am not happy about, however, is the one-sided nature of this Agreement, in which the EU, on the one hand, is making numerous concessions, while the United States, on the other, is insisting on restrictions on foreign ownership, for example."
"The EU must put itself in a stronger position in relation the United States in this regard."
"in writing. - (LT) The open-skies agreement reached between the United States and the European Union is a guarantor of progress and a mirror of economic development for both regions."
"Fully opening the transatlantic market would represent an important step towards improving the situation in the global aviation sector."
"There would be an economic benefit for both parties worth millions, and many new jobs would be created, along with business development opportunities."
"While striving for economic benefits, we must not forget security requirements."
"Standards of flight safety and security are vitally important to passengers, crew and the whole aviation sector."
"Security standards must be harmonised in ascending order."
"EU and US institutions responsible for flight security must cooperate at all levels."
"EU security standards must meet the requirements set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation."
"We must make every effort to ensure that our own lives, as well as those of our children and the loved ones, are taken seriously."
"We cannot allow the flying, working and rest time of flight crew members in the European Union to be subject to lower security requirements, which could endanger people's lives."
"I voted in favour of the Agreement on Air Transport between the European Union and the United States."
"I did so precisely in order to make our political weight felt since, although they are not considered the best even by Mr Zasada himself, the agreements reached do offer a way to manage air transport that will in any case benefit the citizens of the two continents, both in terms of travel and trade."
"Thanks to further liberalisation of traffic rights, additional foreign investment opportunities and better coordination of passenger rights policies, the EU and USA have both been guaranteed important benefits."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of this amendment to the EU-US Air Transport Agreement."
"Any suspension would lead to passengers and airlines from the Union experiencing significant losses to the benefits that they have enjoyed since March 2008."
"I agree with the rapporteur's analysis that this Agreement is not perfect."
"However, it has the merit of tabling important elements that enable this process to move forward, and avoid the risk of the activation of the suspension clause in the absence of an agreement of this nature."
"In fact, this Agreement - a second-stage Agreement - does not achieve the end objective of a complete opening up of the market, with no restrictions on either side, although it does contain a series of incentives promoting reform."
"In concrete terms, when the US amends its legislation to allow EU investors to become majority shareholders in US airlines, the EU will reciprocate."
"In any case, this process will not be straightforward, and any decision relating to it will depend on monitoring and the final proposal arrived at, under circumstances that are instrumental to ensuring improved air transport and the success of European companies."
"The European Union and United States aviation markets, taken together, account for about 60% of world air traffic."
"The Protocol to Amend the Air Transport Agreement provides for the market to be opened up to EU and US airlines on a non-discriminatory basis and offers passengers and freight operators improved services, in terms of both variety and cost, provides substantial economic benefits and creates jobs."
"In addition, further progress on cooperation and regulatory convergence in this area could do much to promote fair competition, particularly with regard to State subsidies and social and environmental standards."
"For the reasons outlined above, I am therefore voting in favour of the adoption of the Protocol to Amend the Air Transport Agreement between the EU and the US."
"in writing. - (PT) Despite not having achieved the end objective of the complete opening up of the transatlantic air market, this second-stage Agreement between the EU and the US represents significant progress in this direction, providing new commercial opportunities for European airlines and substantial benefits to passengers and cargo operators, in terms both of strengthening the provision of services and of reducing costs."
"I therefore voted in favour of the conclusion of this signing of this Protocol to Amend the Air Transport Agreement between the EU and the US, as I would like to see a continuation of negotiating efforts towards greater liberalisation of traffic rights, the strengthening of cooperation in different areas, and the abolition of regulatory restrictions in place in the US with regard to the ownership and control of US airlines by non-nationals."
"in writing. - The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, extended the circumstances in which Parliament's consent is required for the conclusion of international agreements."
"Air transport agreements now fall within this category because they cover a field to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies."
"Previously, Parliament was only consulted on such agreements."
"As a result, this Protocol to Amend the Air Transport Agreement is subject to Parliament's consent, whereas the initial Agreement was concluded after consultation of Parliament."
"The EU-US aviation markets, taken together, account for about 60% of world air traffic."
"Opening the market to EU and US airlines on a non-discriminatory basis would offer passengers and freight operators improved services, in terms of both variety and cost, provide substantial economic benefits and create jobs."
"In addition, regulatory convergence could do much to promote fair competition, particularly with regard to state subsidies and social and environmental standards."
"European and United States airlines, taken together, account for around 60% of world air traffic, thereby representing an unrivalled economic force in the sector."
"Opening up the EU and US aviation market would, de facto, enable more services to be offered at lower costs, with positive repercussions for both the economy and employment."
"Indeed, common standards would favour a more uniform integrated development, above all from the social and environmental point of view."
"I am therefore pleased to see that the agreement reached contains numerous incentives designed to encourage these changes."
"The ability to make equity investments in the respective airlines, as well as increased consultation and cooperation on security, are just some examples of this."
"I now hope that Parliament adopts the Protocol to Amend the Air Transport Agreement between the EU and the US, avoiding triggering the suspension clause, which would cause the benefits achieved so far to be lost."
"in writing. - (PT) The European Parliament today adopted an Protocol to Amend the Air Transport Agreement in place between the European Union and the United States, and I voted in favour of it."
"The proposal is a significant step toward improving transatlantic relations in the area of aviation."
"The aviation markets in the EU and the US together represent around 60% of global air traffic."
"The opening up of markets to airlines will provide improved services for passengers and cargo operators, and will bring great benefits in terms of the economy and of job creation."
"However, the Agreement should not be seen as the end of the process."
"The Agreement in question, described as second-stage, does not achieve the end objective of the complete opening up of the market, with no restrictions on either side."
"It is also extremely important to have consistent rules with regard to the rights of passengers, and better coordination of policies relating to this."
"Finally, it should also be emphasised that issues such as greater liberalisation of traffic rights, increased opportunities for foreign investment, and the effect of environmental measures on traffic rights will need to be taken into account during any future phase of negotiation."
"I am in favour of adopting the motion for a resolution on the above matter."
"The Treaty of Lisbon extended the circumstances in which Parliament's consent was required for the conclusion of an international agreement."
"Air agreements now fall within this category, because they cover a field to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies."
"Previously Parliament had only been consulted on such agreements."
"The EU-US aviation markets, taken together, account for around 60% of world air traffic."
"Opening the market to EU and US airlines on a non-discriminatory basis would offer passengers and freight operators improved services in terms of both variety and cost, provide substantial economic benefits and create jobs."
"In addition, regulatory convergence could do much to promote fair competition, particularly with regard to state subsidies and social and environmental standards."
"At the same time, we should recognise that a number of issues remain outside the scope of the Agreement as amended by the new Protocol."
"For this reason, the Commission needs to look forward towards negotiating another stage of this Agreement, covering issues including: further liberalisation of traffic rights, additional foreign investment opportunities and the effect of environmental measures and infrastructure constraints on the exercise of traffic rights."
"I am voting for this report, firstly because it is a substantial improvement on the current bilateral agreements between Member States and Canada, which are quite restricted, and secondly because of the significant improvement that it offers in terms of services and air connections between the two markets, with the resulting economic, environmental, security, passenger transport, competition and legal benefits, amongst other things."
"The European Union and Canada have agreed to cooperate on air transport with the aim of mitigating the impact of aviation on climate change."
"In terms of security and passenger safety, the Agreement envisages mutual recognition of standards and 'one-stop' security."
"All European Union airlines will be able to operate weekly flights between Canada and the EU."
"This Agreement will significantly improve the connections between the markets of both countries and the links between people, while creating new opportunities for the airline sector through a gradual liberalisation of foreign ownership rules."
"I voted for this report as it contains specific provisions for improving consumer interests."
"Until now, air transport between EU Member States and Canada has been regulated solely by bilateral agreements."
"As the European Union and Canada have long maintained economic and political links, it has become necessary for the two parties to reach an agreement on air transport."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this Agreement, which provides for the phased implementation of traffic rights, investment opportunities and cooperation in a number of areas (not least air safety through the creation of a shared security system, but also social matters, consumer interests and environmental issues)."
"Under the Agreement, all existing restrictions on routes, pricing and the number of services flying between the European Union and Canada will also be removed."
"This Agreement is both ambitious and essential."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with the EU-Canada Air Transport Agreement."
"The Agreement includes a gradual phasing-in of traffic rights and investment opportunities, as well as far reaching cooperation on a number of issues including safety, security, social matters, consumer interests, environment, air traffic management, state aids and competition."
"All EU airlines will be able to operate direct flights to Canada from anywhere in Europe."
"It is also to be welcomed that this Agreement removes all restrictions on routes, prices, or the number of weekly flights between Canada and the EU."
"Airlines will be free to enter into commercial arrangements such as code-share agreements, which are important for airlines serving a large number of destinations, and to establish their tariffs in line with the countries' competition law."
"In 2007, the Council granted the Commission a mandate to negotiate a global aviation agreement."
"That year 9 million people travelled between the United States and Canada."
"The purpose of the Agreement was to create a single market for air transport."
"This entailed the need to modify Canadian legislation."
"Progress in totally opening up the market and implementing the necessary legislative changes has been gradual."
"Nonetheless, the fact that restrictions on routes have been eliminated, weekly flights have been introduced and commercial agreements are now open to airlines, all constitute advances."
"Despite the difficulties, I believe we must continue to work until the single market becomes a reality."
"That is why I voted in favour."
"in writing. - (BG) It is well known that prior to this Agreement, aviation was the subject of bilateral agreements with 19 of the EU Member States."
"I supported this proposal because it will facilitate air transport, but mainly because it includes a gradual phasing-in of air traffic rights and investment opportunities, as well as far-reaching cooperation on a number of issues including safety, security, social matters, consumer interests, the environment, air traffic management, state aids and competition."
"Such an Agreement was a necessity."
"in writing. - (CS) An aviation agreement between the EU and Canada would, under normal circumstances, have my full support, as I am wholly in favour in removing barriers to free movement, both within the EU and between the EU and third countries."
"In a situation where Canada continues to impose a unilateral visa requirement on citizens of the Czech Republic, however, I regard this Agreement as the misguided accommodation on the part of the EU of a country which does not deserve such accommodation."
"The EU should have the courage to link both of these issues - the visa requirement and the signing of the international agreement - as this may provide a rare opportunity to put effective pressure on Canada over the visa affair."
"It is astonishing that Canada, on the one hand, allows EU airlines to operate direct flights to Canada from anywhere in the EU, and, on the other hand, prevents the citizens of one Member State from travelling freely to Canada."
"It is widely felt that the relationship between the EU and Canada has gradually developed into a strategic partnership, and the concluded Agreement will confirm and strengthen the nature of the partnership."
"However, if Canada continues to impose a unilateral visa requirement against Czech citizens, this partnership will have a very bitter taste to it."
"This Agreement, which will enable European airlines to establish direct flights to Canada from any point in Europe, as well as to explore code sharing for these routes, can be described as the most ambitious air transport agreement concluded by the European Union."
"It seeks to eliminate provisions included in previous bilateral agreements that violated Union Law, and which threatened equality of treatment between companies owned by nationals of different Member States."
"I would like to see European Union-Canada relations strengthened, and for us to be able to move more and better toward air space with fewer barriers between states."
"in writing. - (PT) This recommendation deals with the draft decision of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council on the conclusion of the Agreement on Air Transport between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and Canada, of the other part."
"Economic and political relations between the European Union and Canada date back a long time, and have given rise to bilateral agreements in this area."
"However, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009, which requires European Parliament approval for agreements relating to air services, the Commission began a process of negotiation that has now come to an end, through which a set of traffic rights and investment possibilities have been established, together with cooperation in several areas: security, defence of consumer rights, the environment, management of air traffic, social rights and fair competition."
"I therefore welcome the adoption of this proposal, which will facilitate travel for EU and Canadian citizens by removing various restrictions, enabling code sharing and establishing fairer pricing."
"The similarities between the objectives in this case and the Agreement with the US are clear: the creation of a single market for air transport between the EU and Canada, a market that, in 2007, represented a volume of 9 million passengers."
"The rapporteur stated that the Agreement is even 'more ambitious and specific than the EU-US Agreement', but also acknowledges that 'Although this Agreement is more ambitious than that with the US regarding market access, it is less explicit when it comes to recognising the importance of the social dimension'."
"In other words, even the empty references made to the impact of the Agreement on jobs, workers and working conditions were overlooked in this case."
"The truth is that, in this case as well, the absence of restrictions that was demanded with regard to suppliers and services provided - for operations between countries, within each country, and even outside the EU and Canadian markets, as provided for by the Agreement - and to limitations on state intervention in airlines will contribute to the objective of opening the way to monopolistic concentration within the sector..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The objectives of this report are clear: the creation of a single market for air transport between the EU and Canada, a market that, in 2007, represented a volume of 9 million passengers."
"The rapporteur stated that the Agreement is even 'more ambitious and specific than the EU-US Agreement', but also acknowledges that 'Although this Agreement is more ambitious than that with the US regarding market access, it is less explicit when it comes to recognising the importance of the social dimension'."
"In other words, even the empty references made to the impact of the Agreement on jobs, workers and working conditions were overlooked in this case."
"Even the absence of restrictions that was demanded with regard to suppliers and services provided - for operations between countries, within each country, and even outside the EU and Canadian markets, as provided for by the Agreement - and to limitations on state intervention in airlines will contribute to the objective of opening the way to monopolistic concentration within the sector, with adverse effects for workers and passengers, contrary to what has been said."
"That is why we voted against."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this document, because the Agreement includes a gradual phasing-in of traffic rights and investment opportunities, as well as far reaching cooperation on a number of issues including safety, security, social matters, consumer interests, environment, air traffic management, state aids and competition."
"All EU airlines will be able to operate direct flights to Canada from anywhere in Europe."
"The Agreement removes all restrictions on routes, prices, or the number of weekly flights between Canada and the EU."
"Airlines will be free to enter into commercial arrangements such as code-share agreements, which are important for airlines serving a large number of destinations, and to establish their tariffs in line with competition law."
"The Agreement contains provisions for the phased market opening linked to the granting of greater investment freedoms by both sides."
"The ambitious nature of this Agreement is very much to be welcomed."
"It should serve as a target for other negotiations currently underway."
"I therefore believe that Parliament should consent to the EU-Canada Air Transport Agreement."
"All of these air agreements are beneficial and necessary for the European Union, our airlines and our citizens."
"in writing. - I welcome this Agreement, which can fairly be described as the most ambitious air transport agreement between the EU and a major world partner."
"It will significantly improve both the connections between respective markets and people-to-people links, as well as creating new opportunities for the airline sector through a gradual liberalisation of foreign ownership rules."
"In particular, it is more ambitious and specific than the EU-US Agreement with regard to traffic rights, ownership and control, even following the provisional application of the amending Protocol ('second stage')."
"According to a study launched by the Commission, an open agreement with Canada would generate an additional half a million passengers in its first year and, within a few years, 3.5 million extra passengers might be expected to take advantage of the opportunities such an agreement could offer."
"The Agreement could generate consumer benefits of at least EUR 72 million through lower fares and would also create new jobs."
"Although the European Union and Canada have long-standing economic and political ties, prior to the current Agreement, aviation was the subject of bilateral agreements with a number of the Member States."
"It is therefore necessary to pursue the objective of establishing an Open Aviation Area that clears the way for the creation of a single market for air transport, in which investments would flow freely and both parties' airlines would be able to provide air services without any restrictions."
"We think that existing legal restrictions on ownership of Canadian airlines should be removed and, at the same time, new traffic rights and cooperation on a range of issues - including passenger safety, respect for the environment, air traffic management and security - ought to be introduced."
"We can therefore surely say that the Agreement adopted today is truly ambitious."
"It will bring about a decisive improvement in connections between the respective markets and will create new opportunities for the sector."
"However, we do recommend increased consultation and cooperation on the delicate issue of security and we call on the Commission to keep Parliament informed of all developments and to watch over the work of the new Joint Committee."
"The EU-Canada Air Transport Agreement is very important for the future of relations between both sides."
"As such, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament needs to be fully informed and consulted with regard to the work carried out by the Joint Committee, as well as all of the entities involved."
"Any Agreement that is to be concluded will need to be adopted by Parliament, which will therefore need to be kept up-to-date with all negotiations."
"This Agreement is therefore an important step towards opening up the market to airlines from the EU and Canada without any discrimination."
"This opening up of the market may contribute to the improvement of services provided to passengers."
"This is the most ambitious transport Agreement ever signed between two countries."
"in writing. - I fully agree with Silvia-Adriana Ţicău: the Agreement is the most ambitious air transport agreement between the EU and a major world partner."
"It will significantly improve both connections between the respective markets and people-to-people links, and will create new opportunities for the airline sector through a gradual liberalisation of foreign ownership rules."
"In particular, it is more ambitious and better focused than the EU-US Agreement in terms of traffic rights, ownership and control."
"I voted in favour of this agreement on air transport between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and Canada, of the other part."
"This is a very ambitious Agreement, which provides for the gradual establishment of traffic rights and investment possibilities, together with full cooperation in several areas, including questions of security, social questions, the defence of consumer interests, the environment, the management of air traffic, state aid and competition."
"All European Union airlines will be able to operate direct flights to Canada from any European airport."
"The Agreement removes all existing restrictions on routes, prices and the number of weekly flights between Canada and the EU."
"It is with satisfaction that I am voting vote for this Agreement, given its ambitious nature and the possibilities that it opens up for making the historical ties that exist between the Azores and Canada even closer."
"The EU-Canada Air Transport Agreement is one of the most ambitious air transport agreements between the EU and a major world partner."
"It includes a gradual phasing-in of traffic rights and investment opportunities, as well as far-reaching cooperation on issues such as: safety, security, social matters, consumer interests, the environment, air traffic management, state subsidies and competition."
"The Agreement will improve the connections between the respective markets and people-to-people links, as well as creating new opportunities for the airline sector through a gradual liberalisation of foreign ownership rules."
"According to recent studies, an open agreement with Canada would generate an additional half million passengers in its first year and, within a few years, 3.5 million extra passengers might be expected to take advantage of the opportunities such an agreement could offer."
"The Agreement could generate consumer benefits of at least EUR 72 million through lower fares and would also create new jobs."
"For the reasons outlined above, I am voting in favour of the adoption of the Agreement on air transport between the EU and Canada."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of concluding the EU-Canada Air Transport Agreement, which will enable European airlines to establish direct flights to Canada from any point within Europe, generating, firstly, new opportunities for European companies - in particular, thanks to the possibility of reaching code-sharing agreements and the progressive liberalisation of rules in the area of foreign investment - and, secondly, substantial economic benefits, both for consumers and with regard to job creation."
", in writing - (CS) In my opinion, the aviation agreement with Canada is a fundamental commercial instrument which will deliver benefits to both sides, but in view of the discrimination against Czech citizens and the position of MPs from the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, I am abstaining from the vote."
"The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic has suspended talks on the ratification of the Agreement until such time as there is clear progress by the Commission in talks with Canada over ending the unilateral visa requirement for Czech citizens."
"For almost two years there has been a two-tier citizenship of the EU, as Czech citizens cannot travel freely to Canada like others do, while Canadians can travel freely to the Czech Republic."
"The Czech Republic cannot respond reciprocally because of the common visa policy of the EU, but the Commissioner is failing to safeguard this policy."
"in writing. - The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, extended the circumstances in which Parliament's consent was required for the conclusion of an international agreement."
"Air agreements now fall within this category because they cover a field to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies."
"Previously Parliament had only been consulted on such agreements."
"Although the EU and Canada have long-standing economic and political ties, prior to the current Agreement, aviation was the subject of bilateral agreements with 19 of the EU Member States."
"Many of these agreements were restrictive and did not offer full access to the respective markets."
"In November 2002, the European Court of Justice ruled that certain provisions in these bilateral agreements were incompatible with Community law."
"The Council therefore gave the Commission a mandate, in October 2007, to negotiate a comprehensive aviation agreement in place of the existing bilateral agreements."
"In that year nine million people were travelling between the EU and Canada."
"The EU-Canada Air Transport Agreement was initialled on 30 November 2008, endorsed by the EU-Canada summit on 6 May 2009 and signed on 17-18 December 2009."
"The EU and Canada also negotiated an agreement on air safety."
"This is the subject of a separate recommendation."
"Although the European Union and Canada have long-standing economic and political ties, until today the only existing Agreement on aviation between the EU and Canada was borne out of a combination of bilateral agreements between countries."
"This protocol includes the introduction of traffic rights and investment opportunities, as well as cooperation on a number of issues, particularly increased guarantees on safety and security."
"I am in favour of the text of this Agreement because it introduces measures designed to gradually open up the Canadian air market, allowing greater investment freedoms for both parties."
"In order to properly fulfil the mandate, Canada needs to change its legislation to remove the existing legal restrictions on ownership and control of Canadian airlines and on the number of services offered by each airline."
"This Agreement, which can be described as the most ambitious air transport agreement concluded by the European Union, will enable European airlines to operate direct flights to Canada from any European airport, while also introducing commercial mechanisms such as code sharing."
"The Agreement provides for the gradual establishment of traffic rights and investment possibilities, together with full cooperation in several areas, including questions of security, social questions, the defence of consumer interests, the environment, the management of air traffic, state aids and competition."
"In the document adopted today in the sitting, the Committee on Transport and Tourism, of which I am a substitute member, calls upon the European Commission to ensure that Parliament be informed and consulted systematically with regard to the activities of the Joint Committee established, so that it can monitor the various stages of the opening up of the market."
"I voted in favour of the recommendation, and the Agreement in question should serve as an example for other negotiations currently under way."
"in writing. - (DE) This Agreement serves as a model for current and future negotiations with other States."
"It will remove all restrictions on routes, prices, or the number of weekly flights between the two parties to the agreement."
"According to predictions, the potential savings as a result of cheaper flight prices amount to EUR 72 million, which would benefit consumers directly."
"The Aagreement will have further indirect benefits for our citizens as a result of the creation of new jobs."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Agreement."
"I am voting for this report because the continuation of the existing bilateral air agreements with Vietnam would not be in line with European law, and because of the possible opportunities that this greater openness could bring about."
"Until now, bilateral agreements on air transport concluded between EU Member States and third countries have created the potential for discrimination against certain European Union carriers."
"The new Agreement therefore includes an EU designation clause that encompasses all European Union carriers and will replace the traditional designation clauses which referred to air carriers from individual Member States."
"In doing so, the Agreement is designed to prevent discrimination amongst European Union carriers and to eliminate anti-competitive practices."
"I have therefore voted in favour of the Agreement, which will allow all European Union air carriers to operate flights between any Member State and Vietnam."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with the conclusion of this Agreement."
"The Agreement's objective is to give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and Vietnam."
"This Agreement also ensures that safety provisions in bilateral agreements are applicable to situations when regulatory control over an air carrier is exercised by a Member State other than the Member State that designated that air carrier."
"Furthermore, I believe that it is very important that the Agreement prohibits anti-competitive practices."
"The Court of Justice has ruled that all bilateral agreements signed before now are in contravention of European Union law."
"It has therefore been necessary to amend three articles in order to prevent discrimination between airlines and outlaw potentially anti-competitive activities, as well as to ensure that safety clauses apply where a Member State controls transport designated by another Member State."
"in writing. - (BG) I wish to explain my vote on the Aair Transport Agreement between the European Union and Vietnam."
"I voted in favour of this Agreement because I learnt that the Agreement concluded by the Commission replaces, for the better, certain provisions in the existing 17 bilateral air services agreements concluded between EU Member States and Vietnam."
"As we are aware, according to Parliament's Rules of Procedure, no amendments can be tabled, but I think that the Commission has agreed the necessary arrangements and I support this Agreement."
"The Commission has been asked by the Council to seek the replacement of certain provisions within the agreements relating to air services, after the Court of Justice found that they did not comply with Union Law."
"The amendments in question provide for granting all European airlines access to routes between the European Union and Vietnam, and prohibit anti-competitive practices."
"These amendments ensure compliance with the principle of freedom of establishment, and seek to ensure identical treatment within a host Member State to that availed to nationals of that Member State."
"I would like to see contacts and exchanges between the European Union and Vietnam benefiting from the mutual advantages offered to airlines, and for these to lead to their peoples to have better knowledge of each other."
"in writing. - (PT) I welcome the adoption of this draft Council decision seeking the conclusion of an agreement between the European Union on the one hand, and the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam on the other, relating to certain aspects of air services."
"International relationships in the area of aviation between Member States and third countries used to be regulated through the establishment of bilateral agreements."
"However, a 2002 judgement by the Court of Justice of the European Union deemed this situation to be illegal, as it contravened Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"The Commission therefore initiated a negotiation process seeking to replace the 17 bilateral agreements on air services that are in force between Member States and Vietnam."
"This process, which has now come to an end, aimed to provide all EU carriers with non-discriminatory access to routes between the EU and Vietnam, require compliance with safety standards, and prevent anti-competitive practices."
"This Agreement, like the others, serves the objectives of liberalisation within the air services sector, with the justification, as in other cases, that the 2002 judgement of the EU Court of Justice deems existing bilateral agreements to contravene Union law."
"As in other regrettable situations, the interpretation of Union law once more seems to give priority to freedom of competition over all other social and economic precepts."
"We are expressing here the same reservations that we have about other agreements, their scope and the possible consequences that they may have."
"Within the current context in which civil aviation activity is taking place, the creation of equal conditions for the various European companies could contribute to facilitating the process of monopolistic concentration within the sector that is already under way, with all the adverse effects that this would have for aviation company workers and for passengers."
"In order for the market to be dominant within this sector, the ability of Member States to defend their flag carriers has to be reduced."
"We are faced with an agreement that serves the objectives of liberalisation within the air services sector, with the justification, as in other cases, that the 2002 ruling of the EU Court of Justice deems existing bilateral agreements contravene Union law."
"Once again, as in other regrettable situations, the interpretation of Union law seems to give priority to freedom of competition over all other social and economic precepts, even where there are bilateral agreements between Member States."
"We are therefore expressing the same reservations that we have about other agreements, their scope and their possible consequences."
"Within the current context in which civil aviation activity is taking place, the creation of equal conditions for the various European companies could contribute to facilitating the process of monopolistic concentration within the sector that is already under way, with all the adverse effects that this would have for aviation company workers and for passengers."
"The ability of Member States to defend their flag carriers should not be reduced."
"in writing. - (IT) The new competences acquired by the European Union also include air transport agreements."
"The Agreement in question with Vietnam sets out procedures to implement a number of regulations, particularly in terms of security."
"The recommendation is clear and I support it."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this report, because international aviation relations between Member States and third countries have traditionally been governed by bilateral air services agreements."
"As for bilateral air services agreements between EU Member States and Vietnam, I am pleased that the objective is to give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and Vietnam; safety provisions in bilateral agreements are applicable to situations when regulatory control over an air carrier is exercised by a Member State other than the Member State that designated that air carrier; and anti-competitive practices are prohibited."
"All of these air agreements are beneficial and necessary for the European Union, our airlines and our citizens."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report."
"International aviation relations between Member States and third countries have traditionally been governed by bilateral air services agreements."
"The EU Court of Justice ruled in 2002 that traditional designation clauses in Member States' bilateral air services agreements infringe EU law."
"They allow a third country to reject, withdraw or suspend the permissions or authorisations of an air carrier that has been designated by a Member State but that is not substantially owned and effectively controlled by that Member State or its nationals."
"This has been found to constitute discrimination against EU carriers established in the territory of a Member State but owned and controlled by nationals of other Member States."
"This is contrary to Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which guarantees nationals of Member States who have exercised their freedom of establishment the same treatment in the host Member State as that accorded to nationals of that Member State."
"There are also further issues, such as competition, where compliance with EU law should be ensured through amending or complementing existing provisions in bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries."
"That is why the Commission negotiated this agreement."
"The bilateral agreements on international air transport entered into by the European Union with third countries now require a radical overhaul."
"The Court of Justice has ruled that traditional designation clauses in such agreements are entirely incompatible with EU law since they violate the freedom of establishment of foreign companies and do not guarantee them the same treatment that the host Member State accords to its own companies."
"We therefore welcome the conclusion of this agreement tabled by the Commission, which aims to give all European Union air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes to and from Vietnam, while avoiding any anti-competitive practice."
"The clauses on possible fuel tax for air services ought to be removed and it would be desirable for the traditional designation clauses referring to air carriers of third countries to be replaced by a European Union designation clause referring to EU air carriers."
"By doing this, an extra balancing factor would be added to the bilateral agreements."
"Lastly, it would be worth establishing increasingly stringent safety measures, particularly in situations where regulatory control over an air carrier is exercised by a Member State other than that which designated it."
"The EU-Vietnam Agreement is very important for the future of relations between both sides."
"As such, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament needs to be fully informed and consulted with regard to the work carried out by the Joint Committee, as well as all of the entities involved."
"Any agreement that is to be concluded will need to be adopted by Parliament, which will therefore need to be kept uptodate with all negotiations."
"This Agreement is therefore an important step towards opening up the market to airlines from the EU and Vietnam without any discrimination."
"This opening up of the market may contribute to the improvement of services provided to passengers."
"The bilateral agreements on air services between the European Union and third countries include clauses that have proved to be in breach of EU law as they do not guarantee equal treatment outside the EU for the various air carriers, which is why we need a specific agreement that protects passengers and airlines."
"I voted in favour of the agreement precisely in order to guarantee that all European air carriers can use Vietnamese air routes equally, without running the risk of being banned."
"Furthermore, the scope of the agreement aims at greater flight and passenger safety."
"If, in fact, for various reasons we cannot have the same standards that we have within the Union, then it is appropriate that some core points and rules are established."
"Following the 2002 judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Union ruling that the traditional designation clauses included within bilateral Air Services Agreements signed by Member States contravened Union law, it became necessary to negotiate an agreement that sought to replace certain provisions within the current 17 bilateral air services agreements between Member States and Vietnam."
"The clause in question contravened Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which guarantees nationals of Member States exercising their freedom of establishment the same treatment within a host Member State as that given to nationals of that Member State."
"Thus, in order to avoid discrimination between EU air carriers, the traditional designation clauses relating to air carriers of a Member State that is a party to a bilateral Agreement are being replaced by an EU designation clause, applicable to all EU carriers."
"The aim of this is to provide all EU air carriers with non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and Vietnam."
"In light of all of the above, I voted in favour of this report, which also merited a favourable opinion from the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the conclusion of the Agreement on Air Transport between the EU and Vietnam, which is aimed at replacing certain provisions of the 17 existing bilateral air services agreements signed by that country and the Member States, guaranteeing EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and Vietnam, in accordance with what was established by the Court of Justice in 2002, along with compliance with Community law on competition."
"in writing. - International aviation relations between Member States and third countries have traditionally been governed by bilateral air services agreements."
"The EU Court of Justice ruled in 2002 that traditional designation clauses in Member States' bilateral air services agreements infringe EU law."
"They allow a third country to reject, withdraw or suspend the permissions or authorisations of an air carrier that has been designated by a Member State but that is not substantially owned and effectively controlled by that Member State or its nationals."
"This was found to constitute discrimination against EU carriers established in the territory of a Member State but owned and controlled by nationals of other Member States, contrary to Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which guarantees nationals of Member States who have exercised their freedom of establishment the same treatment in the host Member State as that accorded to nationals of that Member State."
"There are also further issues, such as competition, where compliance with EU law should be ensured through amending or complementing existing provisions in bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries."
"I think the final text voted on today is pleasing because it allows all European Union carriers to have access to routes between the EU and Vietnam, avoiding discrimination between the various air carriers."
"In addition, guarantees have been made on security and competition which are crucially important for improving air services on this route, which will benefit operators and passengers alike."
"The constant economic growth of this country, which, thanks to the flexibility of its entrepreneurial fabric, has managed to deal with the international crisis better than many, makes it a favoured partner for the EU and today's vote cannot but support this important line of development."
"The Commission has negotiated an agreement between the EU and the Republic of Vietnam which replaces the 17 existing bilateral air services agreements between that country and the Member States."
"The Agreement in question does not contain the usual provision on the taxation of fuel in the EU on flights conducted by third-country operators."
"However, the Agreement entails significant benefits for the EU, and my vote goes towards supporting Parliament's recommendation."
"To this end, I would like to highlight the clause on the designation included in the Agreement which is aimed at giving all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the EU and Vietnam, but also the provisions relating to security and compliance with competition rules."
"in writing. - (DE) The Agreement brought the designation clauses of the previous bilateral air services agreements into line with EU law in accordance with the ruling of the European Court of Justice in 2002."
"I have voted in favour of the conclusion of the Agreement."
"I am voting in favour of this report because it is necessary to conclude negotiations on trade with this region, and I believe that there are positive developments by virtue of the fact that this document includes sectors like energy, industry and raw materials, and, above all, research, innovation and education."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report and would like to urge EU and GCC leaders to intensify cooperation, especially in the area of trade, since negotiations on a free-trade agreement between the EU and the GCC were opened 20 years ago and still have not been concluded."
"Apart from being strategically a very important region for the EU and the West in general, the GCC states are also important trade partners."
"Our trade with this region has been on a constant rise and in 2009 it amounted to EUR 79.7 billion."
"We also have a positive trade balance with GCC countries, as we export goods worth EUR 57.8 billion and our imports amount to EUR 21.8 billion."
"The EEAS should pay more attention to this important region and new EU diplomatic missions should be opened in the GCC member states."
"In this way we would be able to raise the profile of the EU and have more influence in this part of the world."
"EU engagement is needed now more than ever considering the turmoil and unrest this region is experiencing."
"The European Union and Gulf Cooperation Council have been negotiating a free trade agreement for some 20 years."
"Both parties would benefit from more in-depth relations, especially as there are numerous opportunities for cooperation in the fields of education, scientific research and renewable energies."
"On the domestic front, the GCC countries have, for some years now, been going through a new process of political and social modernisation, which must be supported and encouraged."
"I think that we need continuous dialogue between the European Union and Gulf Cooperation Council in order to make progress in promoting human rights and freedoms, as well as those of minorities, and in the battle against every form of discrimination, including discrimination based on gender or religion."
"This is the reason why I voted for this report."
"For some 20 years, the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council have been trying to negotiate a free trade agreement."
"The negotiations have still not been concluded."
"A great deal has changed over those 20 years."
"The Gulf Cooperation Council members have now become the economic powerhouse of the Middle East and North Africa region."
"They also constitute the main investors in the European Union's southern Mediterranean neighbourhood."
"Consequently, the potential for cooperation between the European Union and the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council goes beyond trade, extending to fields such as science and education."
"This is why I voted in favour of the own-initiative report which calls on the European Parliament to devise a more ambitious policy with regard to the Gulf Cooperation Council."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report."
"The European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have been negotiating a free trade agreement for some 20 years."
"These are the longest-running and hitherto non-concluded trade negotiations that the EU has undertaken."
"In the course of this period, the situation in this region has changed profoundly."
"Over two decades, the GCC member states became the main economic powerhouse for the Middle East and North Africa, while the newly emerging region itself has significant influence on the development of the global economy."
"I agree with the proposals made in the report that it is necessary to swiftly conclude a free trade agreement with this region that is important for the EU."
"The potential for cooperation between the EU and the Gulf region applies not only to the realm of trade, but to other shared interests in international security, in combating terrorism, in diplomatic mediation in Middle Eastern trouble spots, in regional crisis management and in intercultural dialogue and global economic governance."
"in writing. - (BG) Through this own-initiative report the European Parliament aims to call for a more ambitious EU policy to be devised in relation to the Gulf Cooperation Council and its member states."
"I voted for this report because I think that this is the direction we should choose."
"All the more so as the Gulf Cooperation Council recently declared that it no longer recognises Muammar Gaddafi's regime as legitimate."
"We are pleased and encouraged by this policy."
"The Council condemned the crimes perpetrated by the Gaddafi regime against the civilian population and called for immediate intervention from the League of Arab States and the UN Security Council."
"The integration process initiated 30 years ago by the six member states of this Council is still so far the only experiment of its kind in the Arab world."
"We must support them."
"It is more important than ever for the European Union to have a free trade agreement with the Gulf states."
"The record in terms of negotiations on such an agreement is poor as far as their duration is concerned."
"The situation has obviously changed several times in the 20 years since they started."
"The Gulf region's geopolitical climate is different now, entailing global and regional implications."
"We have to deal with the liberalisation and diversification of the economies in these states."
"At present, the Gulf states are much more than mere trade partners, as they have an ever-increasing influence on the financial sector and diplomacy, not to mention other areas. Indeed, their influence will continue to grow."
"This creates a new outlook for the European Union, which understands that cooperation between both regions extends beyond trade."
"We have shared interests in the areas of international security, the fight against terrorism, diplomatic mediation in the tension zones in the Middle East, regional crisis management, intercultural dialogue and global economic governance."
"The EU has certain advantages to draw on by comparison with the new players in the Gulf region, provided that political will is shown at the highest level."
"I voted in favour of this report on trade, economic and financial relations between the EU and the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), namely Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman."
"I agree with the provisions in the text as regards relations between the EU and the Arab countries in the Gulf region, especially in relation to strategic agreements in the areas of energy, science and education."
"It is also important to achieve a free trade agreement."
"I believe that it is in the interests of the EU and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to forge closer relations at all levels, be they political, cultural, commercial or financial."
"On the matter of this report, for which I was the rapporteur for the Committee on International Trade, I would like to highlight three proposals which I have advocated from the beginning and which have been warmly welcomed by the other members: 1) an increase in the diplomatic presence in the region by setting up an EU delegation in each of the GCC member states, through the European External Action Service (EEAS); 2) the holding of regular Heads of State or Government summits between the EU and the GCC; and, finally, 3) an invitation for the High Representative/Vice-President and the Commissioner for Trade to consider alternative approaches to future trade relations with the GCC countries, in the form of bilateral agreements between the EU and the Gulf States that already feel prepared to enter into further commitments with the EU."
"Although the latter proposal represents a new EU approach to relations with third countries, I believe that neither the EU nor every one of the GCC countries willing to forge closer relations in all areas can remain hostage to other GCC countries that do not yet feel comfortable to do so."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of this report because it argues that the potential for cooperation between the EU and the Gulf region goes beyond the merely commercial sphere."
"Good relations between these regional blocs can make an important contribution towards safeguarding common interests such as international security, the fight against terrorism, and global economic governance."
"The recent turmoil and social, political and military unrest in various Muslim-majority countries add to the need for the EU to develop a strategy for the Gulf region and to establish contacts and lasting partnerships with the leading multilateral institution in the region, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)."
"There are obvious security and economic-financial issues that connect both parties, so the EU should increase its efforts and channel resources in order to better raise awareness and seek to complete the draft trade agreement which, I believe, may not only increase trade but also help to bring their respective populations into greater contact."
"I hope that the reforms that have been undertaken by some of these countries will be consolidated and the Europe can contribute to this process in a positive way."
"in writing. - (PT) This motion for a Parliament resolution deals with relations between the EU and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), with a view to establishing a strategic partnership involving their member states."
"Despite the turmoil in certain Arab countries that has been reported recently, the Gulf states have great economic potential and present an excellent opportunity for cooperation with the EU."
"These countries represent an excellent opportunity for trade not only because they are producers of oil, of which reserves are becoming exhausted, but mainly because they are beginning to invest in alternative energies, and Europe is also known for its expertise in this field."
"I am therefore pleased that this report has been adopted and I hope that we will soon be able to adopt an agreement that will strengthen the EU's partnerships with the Islamic community."
"There is no shortage of causes for concern and areas of instability which are making the geopolitical regional context extremely complex: the situation in Palestine, the war in Iraq, the situation in Iran, the recent popular uprisings in several countries, such as Yemen, and the situation in Darfur."
"In the face of this situation, the EU has been using double standards in their relations with states in this region, which has hindered the resolution of conflicts, negotiations and peace processes."
"Moreover, it often interferes in the uprisings, without respecting the sovereign laws of the peoples of the region."
"In this context, this report takes as its background the negotiations that took place 20 years ago to reach a free trade agreement between the EU and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), making these the oldest trade negotiations initiated by the EU, but which have not been concluded to this day."
"This alone would be reason enough for us not to support the report."
"However, some of the oral amendments tabled during the vote have made it even more inacceptable, particularly the reference to the position of the UN Security Council on the establishment of an air exclusion zone in Libya, which, as we are aware, is masking the war which is being waged against this country."
"We are aware that the geopolitical situation of the Gulf region is very complex and includes sensitive and serious issues concerning security and peace."
"Notable among these are the peace processes in the Middle East, the war in Iraq, the situation in Iran, the popular uprisings in Yemen and the recent developments in Darfur, besides the latest events in North Africa."
"However, the report notes that 'the Gulf states' sovereign wealth funds account for more than one third of the world total and those funds helped to rescue the global and European financial system'."
"This was the context in which the negotiations took place 20 years ago to reach a free trade agreement between the EU and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which were the longest-running non-concluded trade negotiations that the EU has undertaken."
"The fact is that the EU has been interfering and using double standards in their relations with states in this region, which is hindering the negotiations and even peace processes relating to the sovereign rights of the peoples of the region."
"Moreover, the resolution adopted by Parliament includes new proposals that do not help the peace process in the region..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. - (LT) By voting in favour of this report, I support the demonstrations for democracy and human rights in Bahrain and condemn the government's violent response."
"The countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, currently represent the EU's sixth largest export market and the EU is currently the GCC's main trading partner."
"Notwithstanding this already intensive level of trade, there is still scope for deepening it, as well as room for greater diversification of trade between the two parties, given the size of the EU market and efforts on the part of GCC member states to diversify their exports."
"A free trade agreement would also provide new opportunities for technical cooperation and assistance and the conclusion of the EU-GCC FTA would foster closer ties and further diversification."
"This document restates the EU's opposition to the death penalty and calls for a global moratorium on it; deplores the continuing retention of the death penalty by all GCC member states; therefore invites them to adopt a moratorium on executions; and calls in particular on states practising executions and punishments involving methods such as decapitation, stoning, crucifixion, flagellation or amputation to cease these practices."
"in writing. - I voted for the report on the EU relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council."
"I would like to point out my support for the oral amendments introduced by the rapporteur Mr Baudis to update the report in the light of recent developments."
"It is important to call on all member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council to recognize the continuing popular movement for democratic reform within the wider region with the appeal to the emerging civil society groups to promote the process of genuine peaceful democratic transition within their respective countries."
"in writing. - (FR) For various reasons, the Persian Gulf region is of strategic importance for the European Union, particularly in terms of energy supply."
"The European Union wants to enter into closer cooperation with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) - an organisation made up of the six richest nations in the region - with the conclusion of a free trade agreement forming a key component of that process."
"I voted in favour of this report, which prepares the ground for future cooperation between the Union and the GCC."
"Covering all of the issues relevant to such a partnership, such as the rights of minorities, women's rights, freedom of conscience and expression, but also support for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and areas for strategic partnership such as research, education and fossil and renewable fuels, the motion proposed by my colleague, Mr Baudis, has achieved a fairly broad consensus among the political groups."
"However, recent events in Bahrain have given rise to concerns as to whether the report is sufficiently up-to-date."
"Goodwill on all sides has resulted in some excellent compromise oral amendments being negotiated, thereby bringing the report up to date and ensuring that months of hard work have not been in vain."
"I voted in favour of adopting the Baudis report."
"Mr Baudis' comprehensive report covers all the interesting issues concerning human rights, equal rights for women, freedom of the press and democratisation."
"The report also takes account of recent changes in the political arena in Bahrain."
"I believe that it is absolutely vital to condemn the violence which is being used in this conflict."
"A strategic partnership in many areas, which is highlighted at many points in the report, should make it possible to avoid crises in relations between the EU and the region, and to increase Europe's energy security."
"The Persian Gulf countries are extremely important players in the peace process."
"I would therefore like to say how pleased I am that the report was adopted, and I hope that cooperation between the European Union and the Persian Gulf countries will be even more productive in many areas."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, and particularly welcome the oral amendment adding a new paragraph 7a, which 'calls on all member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council to recognise a continuing popular movement for democratic reform within the wider region and calls for the full engagement with emerging civil society groups to promote a process of genuine peaceful democratic transition, within their own countries, with partners in the region and with the full support of the European Union'."
"Over the 20 years of trade negotiations between the European Union and the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) the context of the negotiations has changed profoundly and these relations must be able to reach a turning-point."
"The conclusion of a free trade agreement remains both a political and a commercial priority."
"The GCC's geopolitical environment is characterised by the emergence of a series of security challenges with global and regional implications that means that a process to liberalise and diversify the basic economic structure of these countries needs to be started up."
"These countries should be able to continue down the path of cooperation and multilateralism."
"The European Union therefore has the task of developing a new strategic partnership that is capable of supporting the ongoing regional integration process."
"Furthermore, it would be desirable for the European External Action Service to open new diplomatic missions in these countries."
"It would therefore be a good idea for Parliament to encourage a more ambitious EU policy with regard to the GCC."
"We should be able to step up relations in areas of cooperation, such as the field of scientific research and technology, while continuing to discuss issues such as the protection of religious minorities, the right to work and freedom of opinion."
"Negotiations between the EU and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have already been taking place for more than two decades, in an attempt to negotiate a free trade agreement."
"This puts these among the longest-running non-conluded trade negotiations that the EU has undertaken."
"Now, in the course of 20 years, the context of the negotiations has changed profoundly."
"The GCC states have subtantial financial clout in the form of sovereign wealth funds, which amounted to more than USD 1 380 billion in 2009, in other words over 35% of the world total."
"The GCC member states have become the economic powerhouse for the entire Middle East/North Africa region, representing more than 40% of the national wealth generated in this area and holding 50% of its official currency reserves, in other words USD 1 070 billion."
"Given the massive financial and economic potential of these countries, we have to make use of the current context if the negotiations are to reach a successful conclusion."
"in writing. - The EU and the Gulf Cooperation Council have been negotiating a free-trade agreement (FTA) for some 20 years: the longest-running non-concluded trade negotiations that the EU has undertaken."
"The report underlines that concluding the FTA remains a priority."
"However, it goes beyond trade relations and also includes the issues of energy, industry and raw materials, R&D and innovation and education."
"I abstained from voting because the agreement should be drawn up in the context of a political response to the situation in the region."
"There should be a separate approach to every single country."
"Let us take Iran as an example."
"It would be a mistake to include Ahmadinejad's regime in the process of negotiations."
"More precise geographical or economic clarifications are necessary."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this resolution on European Union relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council, because the Gulf region is seen today in terms of the emergence of a new global economic hub, whose geopolitical environment makes the Gulf a focus of security challenges that have global and regional implications."
"Furthermore, the GCC is the EU's sixth largest export market and the EU is currently the GCC's main trading partner and it is necessary to develop and diversify mutual relations."
"We must make every effort to ensure that cooperation is extended in various areas of economic and technical activity, and this includes enhancing the process of economic development."
"In addition, strong economic interaction would provide more opportunities to strengthen the EU's regional integration and would create more possibilities for the EU to contribute to increasing the stability of this strategically important region."
"We must do our utmost to ensure that negotiations between these two regions are finally brought to a close and a free trade agreement is concluded which would guarantee new opportunities for technical cooperation and assistance."
"in writing. - (LT) Right up until the breakthrough of the wave of democracy in the Arab countries, the European Parliament has constantly been calling on the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council to improve the situation as regards democracy, the rule of law, and human rights and freedoms."
"Our Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats stressed in particular the need for reforms in social policy and the safeguarding of increased freedoms for unions."
"We firmly opposed executions and the trampling of women's rights."
"By voting in favour of this report, I support the demonstrations for democracy and human rights in Bahrain and condemn the government's violent response."
"I support the rapporteur's calls to share with the Gulf countries the EU Member States' experience introducing technologies for extracting renewable energy sources."
"I also spoke in favour of speeding up negotiations on a free trade agreement between the EU and the countries of the Gulf."
"There is clear potential for cooperation between these two regions not just on the economy, but also on issues of international security, combating terrorism, diplomatic mediation in Middle Eastern conflicts, intercultural dialogue and global economic governance."
"The report by Mr Baudis on European Union relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) relates to the negotiations for free trade between the EU and the countries of the Persian Gulf."
"I think that an agreement that facilitates trade and therefore strengthens all the socio-political ties that reintegrate the region into the global context is fundamental for its future stability following the wars of past few years and recent events, as well as in commercial terms."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report, hoping furthermore for the relationships to be intensified, as this would be of mutual benefit, including in view of a new global governance."
"I voted in favour of this own-initiative report, which constitutes an appeal by Parliament for the formulation of a more ambitious policy on a strategic partnership between the EU and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and its member states."
"The EU and the GCC have been trying to negotiate a free trade agreement for about 20 years."
"These are among the longest-running non-concluded trade negotiations that the EU has undertaken."
"However, in the course of 20 years, the context of these negotiations has changed profoundly."
"In fact, the potential for cooperation between these two regions goes beyond the merely commercial sphere."
"The two blocs share common interests such as international security, the fight against terrorism, diplomatic mediation in areas of tension in the Middle East, regional crisis management, intercultural dialogue and global economic governance."
"I voted in favour of this own-initiative report as I believe that Parliament's appeal for the formulation of a more ambitious EU policy in relation to the GCC and its member states is very timely."
"I hope that the political will that is needed on this matter is felt at the highest level."
"in writing. - (IT) The free trade agreement between the European Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has been under discussion for around 20 years."
"Over this period, the financial and geopolitical circumstances of the GCC have changed drastically: security challenges have emerged (such as, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Islamic terrorism, and piracy) and new commercial players have appeared in the area."
"At the same time, the GCC member states have become the economic powerhouse of the whole Middle East-North Africa region and are now the main investors in the EU's southern Mediterranean neighbourhood area."
"The two regions also have common interests on security, combating terrorism, managing the regional crisis and global economic governance."
"That is why Parliament is today called to formulate a more ambitious cooperation policy with the countries of the GCC."
"The EU has certain advantages to draw on in comparison with the new players operating in the Gulf, above all in terms of education, scientific research, energy and technology."
"We cannot allow the opportunities offered by this particular moment in history - as world economic governance is defined and regional balances are reshaped - to pass unfulfilled."
"The Gulf region is greatly important to the EU, and it is therefore vital to develop a strategy that is aimed at strengthening political, financial, economic, social and cultural ties with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)."
"In view of this, the conclusion of the free trade agreement between the EU and the GCC is a priority."
"The potential of this cooperation also extends to other areas, such as education, energy and scientific research."
"I therefore support the appeal made in this House today for the formulation of a more ambitious EU policy in relation to the GCC and its member states, and I hope that the strengthening of dialogue and cooperation between the EU and the GCC will help to promote and consolidate progress with regard to respect for democratic principles and fundamental rights."
"in writing. - Among the reasons to vote in favour of this text, one should mention the adoption of Amendment 7a (new) that states the following: 'Calls on all member states in the Gulf Cooperation Council to recognise a continuing popular movement for democratic reform within the wider region, and calls for the full engagement with emerging civil society groups to promote a process of genuine peaceful democratic transition, within their own countries, with partners in the region and with the full support of the EU."
"The free trade agreement between the European Union and the Gulf region is a priority for both parties' interests and will emphasise the importance of their mutual recognition."
"The presence of the European Union in the region strengthens trade policy, contributing to the development of targeted and effective information on the EU in the Gulf countries."
"Concluding the agreement in question makes it possible to facilitate increased visibility for the Union by following a strategy of opening new European diplomatic missions in the Gulf states which would encourage political dialogue and make Europe's efforts more effective."
"This also applies in terms of the EU's energy needs, still largely met by fossil fuels, even though future oil demand will be influenced by a climate policy increasingly focussed on renewable sources."
"The social and political developments that have taken place in recent years in most Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states encourage the promotion of human rights and the fight against all forms of discrimination, including those based on gender, sexual orientation or religion."
"A reliable partnership between the EU and the GCC therefore needs to be built, which will favour open markets for goods and the removal of non-tariff barriers."
"in writing. - The UK Conservative delegation and the ECR Group voted in favour of the Baudis Report on EU-GCC relations, including the extensive oral amendments submitted by the rapporteur today in plenary, as it is important to condemn any disproportionate use of force in Bahrain by the authorities, in particular allegations of the shooting of unarmed peaceful protestors."
"We accept that the mainly majority Shia community protestors have themselves in some measure also resorted to unacceptable violence and we call on all sides to exercise maximum restraint."
"Bahrain is a loyal western ally and home to the US Fleet and we welcome the offer of dialogue by the Crown Prince of Bahrain."
"We accept that under the GCC rules the government of Bahrain is entitled to call in Saudi and Kuwaiti assistance in enforcing law and order, but again foreign forces in Bahrain should respect fundamental human rights, including the right to peaceful demonstration."
"We hope an EU-FTA can be concluded as soon as possible as economic growth and job creation, particularly amongst the disadvantaged Shia community, will assist in stabilising the island state and reducing social tension."
"I supported the motion for a resolution which sends a clear signal to our partners in the Arab peninsula."
"Against the backdrop of extreme economic, social and geopolitical tensions, it was essential that this House reiterate its willingness to review our cooperation agreements in light of the events in the Arab world."
"We are not suggesting abandoning historic links, but rather adjusting our relations to reflect the realities on the ground and the needs of the people, making respect for the values championed by the Union a prerequisite for developing economic and political links."
"Dialogue with civil society will also be a key and indispensable feature of each partnership."
"Whilst progress and reforms must be welcomed, a lot remains to be done in order to set these countries firmly on the road to democracy, respect for human rights and civil liberties."
"Part of Europe's destiny is being played out in the Near and Middle East."
"Under the association agreements concluded between the Union and these countries, we now need to find a middle way that is fair to all sides, balancing the pursuit of economic and trade relations against promoting core values."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the report on European Union relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council."
"As thoroughly explained in the report, due to the many advantages for both contractual parties and after 20 years of negotiations, it is time that we made a targeted effort to push for the conclusion of a free trade agreement."
"Above all, however, I support the main points of focus for the negotiations stated in the report, which take account of developments in the area of climate change and the obligation in terms of human rights."
"I am in favour of this appointment because all the legal procedures have been carried out, including a rigorous Curriculum Vitae assessment."
"The Executive Board of the European Central Bank requires a new member."
"I have voted in favour of appointing the Belgian candidate, Mr Praet, in view of his acknowledged authority and professional experience in the field of monetary affairs and banking."
"in writing. - (PT) I support the favourable result of the voting by the Council with regard to the appointment of Mr Praet as an Executive Board Member of the European Central Bank, on the basis of a positive assessment of his Curriculum Vitae and the written responses that he provided to the questionnaire given out to candidates for the post in question."
"At a pivotal moment in the life of the European institutions, when the European Central Bank, in particular, is required to perform an especially careful and interventionist role in monitoring the sovereign debt crisis, the stability of the euro and economic recovery, I wish the newly appointed Mr Praet every success in his office, and I believe that he will perform the functions for which he has been appointed with dedication and competence."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this document, because by letter of 18 February 2011 the European Council consulted the European Parliament on the appointment of Peter Praet as a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank for a term of office of eight years with effect from 1 June 2011."
"Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs then proceeded to evaluate the credentials of the nominee, and in carrying out this evaluation, the committee received a CV from the candidate as well as his replies to the written questionnaire that was sent out to him."
"The committee subsequently held a one-and-a-half-hour hearing with the nominee on 16 March 2011, at which he made an opening statement and then responded to questions from the members of the committee."
"A favourable opinion was delivered to the European Council on the Council recommendation to appoint Peter Praet as a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank."
"in writing. - I voted for this report which, on the basis of a recommendation from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, delivers a favourable opinion to the European Council on the Council recommendation to appoint Peter Praet as a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank."
"The European institutions have to be served by the very best."
"In this instance, the newly appointed Mr Praet comes with an unblemished record and was approved with distinction at the hearing carried out by Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I wish him every success for the eight years of his term."
"I am delighted that Mr Praet has been selected to become a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank."
"As an expert on financial stability and on supervising financial infrastructures and payment systems and as a member of the Management Committee of the Belgian Banking, Finance and Insurance Commission (CBFA), Mr Praet is highly regarded in economic and academic spheres."
"He also has a wealth of experience that can now be put at the service of the European Union."
"I voted in favour of the appointment of Dr Praet as an executive committee member of the European Central Bank (ECB) as he has shown that he is an excellent candidate."
"During the hearing with the candidates held in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Dr Praet proved to be the most knowledgeable and competent candidate by a wide margin."
"In recent years the European Central Bank has shown that it is an essential institution which was capable of managing the crisis and preventing even greater damage being caused."
"Indeed, beginning with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the role played by the ECB - independently and separately from national governments - ensured that the extremely serious consequences of the crisis were not devastating."
"The ECB is and remains a bulwark in defence of the monetary union and the euro."
"For this reason, it is crucial that the members of its executive committee are equipped with exceptional qualities and experience."
"I voted in favour of the report on the appointment of Mr Praet to the post of Executive Board Member of the European Central Bank (ECB) for a term of eight years, to begin on 1 June 2011."
"All of the information presented for this option and which formed the basis for my own decision indicates that the criteria set out in Article 283(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union have been met, and show that there is a need for the ECB to be fully independent, in accordance with Article 130 of that treaty, and I therefore welcome the appointment of Mr Praet."
"I voted in favour of this decision, under which Parliament gives its assent to the Council's recommendation to appoint Mr Praet to the post of Executive Board Member of the European Central Bank."
"I would like to wish him every success in performing the duties which are entrusted to him."
"I am in favour of this appointment because all the legal procedures have been carried out, including a rigorous Curriculum Vitae assessment."
"The purpose of the European Banking Authority, which came into being on 1 January 2011 under the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010, is to guarantee the stability of the financial system, transparency of financial products and markets, and to provide protection for savers and investors."
"The European Banking Authority has nominated Adam Farkas, an economist from the Hungarian National Bank, to become its Executive Director."
"The European Parliament has to approve the selection in order for it to be valid."
"I have voted in favour of the appointment of Mr Farkas."
"I support the appointment of Mr Farkas to the post of Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), based on the answers that he gave to the Board of Supervisors of the European Banking Authority (European Banking Authority)."
"If there were a lesson to be learnt from the recent crisis, it would be that we need to reform the institutional supervisory structure by creating European agencies and thus reformulate the entire concept of macro and micro-economic monitoring."
"The European Banking Authority is the result of that."
"Confidence in banks having been dealt a severe blow by the global financial crisis, it is important for the markets, and for Europeans in general, to start trusting the solidity and robustness of the banking institutions again and, in particular, regain confidence in the supervisory bodies."
"That is why the role reserved for this new European Banking Authority is so crucial for the future."
"Now that Parliament has approved the appointment of the Authority's Executive Director, I hope that he will have an active, prudent and successful term."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this document, because at its meeting of 17 March 2011, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs heard the candidate selected by the Board of Supervisors of the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority), and it was decided that Adam Farkas fulfils the criteria set out in Article 51(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010), and the appointment of Adam Farkas as Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) was also approved."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution, which approves the appointment of Adam Farkas as Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority)."
"The recent financial crisis has highlighted major weaknesses in financial supervision, both in individual cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole."
"Supervision models had a national perspective and did not adapt to the globalisation that has occurred within the financial system, where various financial groups conduct their operations across borders, with the systemic risks that this entails."
"I believe that the creation of the European Banking Authority is essential in order to achieve an effective supervision model."
"However, many other steps need to be taken to prevent the truly immoral situations of the recent past, which have damaged economies, shareholders, depositors, taxpayers and the credibility of the system, from reoccurring."
"I am therefore voting in favour of the choice of Mr Farkas as Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority, and wish him a term of high quality in all respects."
"in writing. - (IT) As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), I carefully followed the entire process leading to the creation of the European Banking Authority."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of the appointment of Mr Farkas as its executive director."
"The European Banking Authority must be put in a position to be able to start carrying out the tasks assigned to it by Parliament some months ago."
"I sincerely hope that the Authority is provided with the human and economic resources it needs so as to ensure that its supervisory role is implemented seriously and precisely."
"During the hearing held in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the new executive director convinced me and my colleagues of his competence and professionalism, as today's vote shows."
"An additional positive factor, which will benefit the process of European integration, is that the new executive director comes from a Member State that only recently acceded to the European Union."
"I voted in favour of the report on the appointment of Mr Farkas to the post of Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority)."
"Mr Farkas was the candidate selected by the Board of Supervisors of the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) and was heard, in accordance with the established procedures, by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"All of the data presented for this option, and on which my decision was based, indicates that the criteria laid down within Article 51(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 were met, and so I am happy with the appointment of Mr Farkas."
"Under this resolution, Parliament has approved the appointment of Mr Farkas to the post of Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority)."
"I would like to wish him every success in performing the duties which are entrusted to him."
"I am in favour of this appointment because all the legal procedures have been carried out, including a rigorous Curriculum Vitae assessment."
"The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), which was created on 1 January 2011 under the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010, is tasked with promoting supervisory convergence and advising the European Union institutions on matters pertaining to the regulation and supervision of insurance, reinsurance and occupational pension schemes."
"The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority has selected the Spaniard Carlos Montalvo, who worked as Acting Secretary General at the forerunner to the new authority, to be its first Executive Director."
"The European Parliament has to approve the selection in order for it to be valid."
"I have voted in favour of the appointment of Mr Montalvo."
"I support the appointment of Mr Montalvo to the post of Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority), based on his selection by the Board of Supervisors of the European Banking Authority."
"One of the lessons learned from the crisis was the need to create independent European agencies for monitoring the banks and insurance in the financial markets."
"These agencies will not replace national supervisory agencies, but will work with them, exercising their mandate for prudence and systemic risk analysis in order to prevent a new crisis of the proportions of the one we are faced with at present from striking European states once more."
"Now that Parliament has approved the appointment of the Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pension Authority), I wish him every success in the important role that he is taking on."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this document, because at its meeting of 17 March 2011, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs heard the candidate selected by the Board of Supervisors of the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority), and it was decided that Carlos Montalvo fulfils the criteria set out in Article 51(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010), and the appointment of Carlos Montalvo as Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) was approved."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution, which approves the appointment of Carlos Montalvo as Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority)."
"in writing. - (PT) The recent financial crisis has highlighted major weaknesses in financial supervision, both in individual cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole."
"Models of supervision have had a national perspective and have not adapted to the globalisation that has occurred within the financial system, in which various financial groups conduct their operations across borders, with the systemic risks that this entails."
"The creation of a European authority for the insurance and occupational pensions sector is therefore essential in order to achieve an effective supervision model, alongside many other monitoring mechanisms, to be decided on and implemented as a matter of true urgency."
"I am therefore voting in favour of the choice of Mr Montalvo as Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority), and I wish him every success in carrying out his office."
"Today's favourable vote sees us add another important piece to the European supervisory structure that Parliament has felt it so important to support since the start of the current legislature."
"During the hearing held last week in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the new executive director demonstrated his competence and knowledge of the sector and the problems that he will have to deal with."
"Additionally, I do not think that the fact that the top two positions at the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) are being filled by people that had the same role in the preceding organisation will be a problem."
"Indeed, I am confident that the new powers granted to EIOPA will ensure that its managers will be able to carry out their task as well as possible."
"I voted in favour of the report on the appointment of Mr Montalvo to the post of Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority)."
"Mr Montalvo was the candidate selected by the Board of Supervisors of the European Banking Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) and was heard, in accordance with the established procedures, by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"All of the data presented for this option, and on which my decision was based, indicates that the criteria laid down within Article 51(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 were met, and so I am happy with the appointment of Mr Montalvo."
"Under this motion for a resolution, Parliament has approved the appointment of Mr Montalvo to the post of Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority)."
"I would like to wish him every success in performing the duties which are entrusted to him."
"I am in favour of this appointment because all the legal procedures have been carried out, including a rigorous Curriculum Vitae assessment."
"The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), established on 1 January 2011 by the 24 November 2010 regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council, is designed to help maintain the stability of the financial system of the European Union by safeguarding the integrity, transparency, efficiency and orderly functioning of financial markets, and by strengthening investor protection."
"ESMA has appointed Mrs Ross, a German former economist at the Bank of England, as its first Executive Director."
"The European Parliament should vote in favour of this nomination in order for it to come into effect."
"For my part, I voted in favour of Mrs Ross' nomination."
"Since the financial markets have been badly affected by the crisis, there is an urgent need to restore confidence."
"To a large extent, this will depend on the role of the supervisory authorities, which will have to carry out their mandates competently and effectively so as to pass on the necessary confidence to investors and companies."
"It is in this context that the European Securities and Markets Authority has been created, which, while not claiming to replace national supervisory agencies, will have an important part to play in the new European supervisory framework."
"Therefore, it is important that this agency begins operation soon."
"Now that Parliament has approved the appointment of the Authority's Executive Director, I wish him a successful term."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this document, because at its meeting of 17 March 2011, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs heard the candidate selected by the Board of Supervisors of the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority), and it was decided that Verena Ross fulfils the criteria set out in Article 51(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010), and the appointment of Verena Ross as Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) was also approved."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution, which approves the appointment of Verena Ross as Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority)."
"The recent financial crisis has highlighted major weaknesses in financial supervision, both in individual cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole."
"Supervision models had a national perspective and did not adapt to the globalisation that has occurred within the financial system, where various financial groups conduct their operations across borders, with the systemic risks that this entails."
"The creation of the European Financial Markets Authority is essential to achieving an effective supervision model."
"However, many other steps need to be taken to prevent the truly immoral situations of the recent past, which have damaged economies, shareholders, depositors, taxpayers and the credibility of the system, from recurring."
"I am therefore voting in favour of the choice of Mrs Ross as Executive Director of the European Securities and Markets Authority, and wish her a term of high quality in all respects."
"I voted in favour of the appointment of Mrs Ross as Executive Director for a number of reasons."
"The recent legislative acts we have adopted, or will be called to adopt, grant a huge range of powers in terms of supervision, analysis and evaluation."
"Just think, for example, of the various technical standards that the authority is asked to evaluate and bring to the attention of the Commission for approval."
"For this reason, it is important for the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to be capable of starting work as soon as possible in order to begin carrying out the mandate granted to it by Parliament last year."
"Lastly, I applaud the fact that a woman has been appointed to one of the highest-profile roles, not only for gender reasons but because of her excellent curriculum vitae."
"As with the other two authorities, I hope that this one is put in a position - in terms of budget, structures and human capital - to function as well as possible."
"I voted in favour of the report on the appointment of Mrs Ross to the post of Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority)."
"Mrs Ross was the candidate selected by the Board of Supervisors of the European Banking Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) and was heard, in accordance with the established procedures, by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"All of the data presented for this option, and on which my decision was based, indicates that the criteria laid down within Article 51(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 were met, and so I am happy with the appointment of Mrs Ross."
"Under this motion for a resolution, Parliament has approved the appointment of Mrs Ross to the post of Executive Director of the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority)."
"I would like to wish her every success in performing the duties which have been entrusted to her."
"I am voting in favour as there is now greater commitment."
"However, it is important to maintain the focus on the connection with the Europe 2020 objectives; on an approach based on 'sustainability and responsibility', not simply 'austerity', as the Council is suggesting, and on the new needs arising from the Treaty of Lisbon, without putting existing, successful programmes at risk."
"Above all, the EU 2012 budget should promote growth and high-quality employment, and help to implement the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"in writing. - I voted against the Balzani report on General guidelines for the preparation of 2012 budget because it believes that the Europe 2020 Strategy will pull Europe out of the economic downturn, when what the nations of Europe really need is to be freed from the dead hand of EU overregulation and overtaxation."
"This 2020 Strategy is not a cure for the problems of the economies."
"In addition, the report claims that European solidarity and economic development will be threatened by a reduction of the budget."
"The European budget has become an expensive luxury that the citizens and taxpayers of Europe cannot afford."
"Calling for a small increase or a freeze is derisory - that is why I voted against a freeze - when what is really needed is a sharp cut in the budget to give the taxpayer a break."
"In the current financial, economic and social crisis, the European institutions are duty-bound to follow the example of Member States in adopting austerity measures."
"That is why I voted in favour of this report which provides for a strict 2012 budget for the European Parliament."
"This budget should still enable Parliament to achieve the objectives set by the EU while using 'the least possible resources'."
"This budget will be established within the context of Europe 2020, a strategy that should help Europe come out of the crisis stronger."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report."
"The priority objectives set in the Europe 2020 Strategy (promoting employment, improving public spending on innovation, research and development, meeting our climate change and energy objectives, improving education levels and promoting social inclusion) should help Europe recover from the crisis and come out stronger, through smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"Some consistency must be ensured between achieving these objectives and the funding allocated to them at European and national level."
"We must endow the EU with the necessary financial means to be able to respond adequately to growing global challenges and to defend and promote its common interests and ensure that the economies of the Member States enjoy a speedy recovery."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for Francesca Balzani's report because, in line with this document, I think that the European Union's 2012 budget must be drawn up with the aim of pursuing the Europe 2020 Strategy's targets."
"In spite of the current economic and financial crisis, it is now important for us to lay the foundations for sound, future economic growth through investments in education, research and development, innovation and SMEs."
"These areas provide the basis for the EU's progress and competitiveness and must be developed from the perspective of creating jobs and increasing territorial and social cohesion."
"I want to stress that we must not reduce the funding in these areas and it is vital for us to monitor constantly that the available resources are being managed with the utmost efficiency."
"I also believe that there is fundamental synergy between national budget priorities and the EU budget."
"I wish to take this opportunity to welcome President Herman Van Rompuy's efforts as part of the European Semester to tighten EU Member States' discipline by promoting clear targets which are measurable and realistic for every country."
"Parliament is the most democratic European institution, directly representing EU citizens' interests."
"This is why I insist that Parliament should be much more actively involved in the European Semester exercise."
"in writing. - (NL) I cannot endorse the Balzani report."
"The first reason is the call for the introduction of a type of EU tax."
"The second reason concerns the economic crisis and the painful interventions being undertaken by Member States."
"The EU, too, must make efforts to ensure that its budget does not continue to run out of control and that it carries out the necessary cuts."
"With this in mind, I advocate a dynamic approach to tackling the ever growing gap between annual appropriations and the amounts being paid out."
"Limiting appropriations would lead to payments and appropriations becoming more closely aligned."
"I realise that multiannual programmes which are coming to an end because of the 2007-2013 Multiannual Framework will entail an increase in payments."
"I propose in that regard that, where some increase in payments is inevitable, it is offset by significantly lower appropriations."
"This also applies to budget lines for which implementation is lagging behind."
"These measures provide a logical and persuasive step towards a more realistic budget in difficult economic times."
"I would like to emphasise how important this report is as the European Union's 2012 budget will help revitalise the European economy."
"At the same time, next year's EU budget must be the main instrument to bring about the European economy's recovery, with great importance being attached to employment, economic governance and growth."
"I think that the 2012 budget must help implement the EU 2020 Strategy's five objectives: employment, innovation, research and development, climate change and energy, education and social integration."
"The EU budget is a budget for investment and 2012 is the sixth year in the current 'financial outlook' (2007-2013), with projects rolling out at a regular rate, which results in an increase in payment levels as the work is carried out."
"In my view, an increase in payment levels is predictable in 2012."
"I voted in favour of the general guidelines for preparing the 2012 budget."
"I believe that the Community budget for 2012 should be one of the main tools in helping the EU to recover from the crisis and come out of it stronger, focusing on employment, economic governance and growth."
"Employment, innovation, research and development, climate change and energy, and training and social inclusion are the five objectives that should guide the drafting of the EU 2012 budget."
"This will allow Europe to experience intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"in writing. - I voted against the Balzani report on General guidelines for the preparation of 2012 budget because it believes that the Europe 2020 Strategy will pull Europe out of the economic downturn, when what the nations of Europe really need is to be freed from the dead hand of EU overregulation and overtaxation."

"in writing. - (SV) We share the committee's view that the difficult economic situation across the Union makes it more important than ever to ensure proper implementation of the EU budget, quality of spending and optimal use of existing Community financing."
"We welcome the call for ambitious proposals for the EU's own resources and believe that the focus should in general be placed on those budget appropriations that are important for achieving results within the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"We also supported the amendment that called for every increase in a budget line to be matched by a reduction in another line."
"However, as this amendment was not voted through and, moreover, the adopted text contains the statement that lowering the level of the EU budget could 'harm European solidarity', we have chosen to abstain in the final vote."
"I voted in favour of the report on the drafting of the 2012 budget as I believe that, given the difficult economic situation throughout the EU, it has never been so important to ensure the proper performance and quality of the budget expenditure and optimal use of existing EU funding."
"The Community budget should be one of the main tools in helping the EU to recover from the crisis and come out of it stronger, focusing on employment, economic governance and growth."
"in writing. - I voted against the Balzani report on General guidelines for the preparation of 2012 budget because it believes that the Europe 2020 Strategy will pull Europe out of the economic downturn, when what the nations of Europe really need is to be freed from the dead hand of EU overregulation and overtaxation."

"In addition the report threatens with the prejudice a reduction of the budget would have on European solidarity and economic development."
"The European budget has become an expensive luxury that the citizens and taxpayers of Europe cannot afford."
"Calling for a small increase or a freeze is derisory when what is really needed is a sharp cut in the budget to give the taxpayer a break."
"This report sets out the priorities for Parliament to follow in preparing and discussing the 2012 budget, taking into account the start of the trialogue at the end of this month."
"This report is groundbreaking, given its imminently political content: it seeks to highlight and step up the important discussions that are taking place in the European institutions and the Member States on all items in the economic governance package."
"It is also aimed at drawing attention to the impact and importance that the 2012 budget may have in meeting the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy for growth and sustainable job creation across the EU."
"Parliament is sending an important political message to the European institutions and the Member States about its firm commitment to strengthening economic governance and fulfilling the objectives set out for growth and employment."
"in writing. - (PT) I agree with the EU 2020 Strategy as it advocates stronger economic governance and the provision of the funds needed to implement its seven key actions."
"The EU 2020 objectives will only be achieved if there is strong governance and European coordination, and if the Member States make the investment needed to carry out their actions."
"However, this strategy can only be fully achieved if there is a new multiannual financial framework."
"This report neglects to mention the importance of cohesion policy even once."
"It also omits any mention of agriculture."
"However, about 80% of the budget is for the cohesion policy and agriculture."
"Young people do not get a single mention in the report either, which is incomprehensible."
"This is the priority for the current budget proposed by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) (PPE)."
"Moreover, young people feature in the five objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"The objectives of reducing school dropout levels to below 10% and ensuring that 40% of young people aged between 30 and 34 have a university degree also pertain only to young people."
"However, I hope that the 2012 budget will contribute to sustainable growth in the EU, enhance competitiveness and promote employment."
"This is one of those times when the objective of economic and social cohesion should demand a completely different vision and content from the EU budget."
"At a time when inequalities between the Member States are worsening, the Community budget should be at the service of real convergence."
"It should promote economic growth, the creation of jobs with rights, the promotion of progress and social welfare, the eradication of poverty and social exclusion, and environmental preservation."
"At the very least, this would require funds to be doubled, based on a greater contribution from countries with a higher GDP per capita."
"This should be followed by a fair and balanced distribution of funds, focusing on countries with greater difficulties."
"We disagree with a budget that focuses on supporting the reconstruction of monopolies and the growing militarisation of the EU, on the liberalisation in numerous sectors of economic activity and the lack of job security, as advocated by the EU 2020 Strategy."
"This path will accentuate existing economic, social, regional and national differences, and will not resolve the problems of unemployment and poverty."
"We therefore voted against."
"Since the beginning of the year, the Committee on Budgets has been drafting the European Parliament's priorities for the 2012 EU budget."
"Parliament's position, which is necessary for talks with the EU Council, will be formulated on the basis of these priorities."
"It would appear that this year's conciliation between Parliament and the Council will be even more challenging than was the case in 2010."
"The Council, which is opposed to any increase in the EU budget, has already announced its own savings plan, which is rather convenient, since it concerns budget lines which have not been fully exploited to date."
"At the same time, Parliament is in favour of an increase in the 2012 budget, but only in line with the Eurostat inflation rate."
"The latter is an objective rate which we cannot vote upon, as some people seem to believe."
"How can the European Parliament justify the proposed increase?"
"Firstly, implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy, including the twin goals of increasing education and employment levels."
"Without adequate funding, these goals will remain defunct, and Europe 2020 will follow in the footsteps of the renowned and ineffective Lisbon Strategy."
"Secondly, the EU budget is already bursting at the seams; the European External Action Service, the Galileo system, the Solidarity Fund and the Globalisation Fund are generating expenditure which it was impossible to predict six years ago, when the current financial perspective was negotiated."
"While on the subject of rational expenditure, I would also call upon Members of this House to take a critical look at the 'buildings policy', which we cannot afford."
"One example of this would be the increase in office space announced for Brussels."
"Here we are at the start of a difficult negotiation between Member States on the 2012 budget while, in the background, the debate is already underway on the post-2013 financial perspectives."
"At this time of crisis, it will be necessary throughout the budgetary process to reiterate our expectations with regard to European policies."
"Unlike some Council members who consider the EU to be an additional cost, an expense to be reduced at the risk of pitting current and future policies against each other, Parliament, through the resolution on general guidelines for the preparation of the 2012 budget, has reiterated its vision of the Union as a vector of added value and an ally of Member States in implementing ambitious policies."
"Furthermore, I voted in favour of the resolution presented by Mrs Balzani because of its consistency and the clear political message it carries, calling for the adoption of a budget that is consistent with the objectives for employment and growth of the EU 2020 Strategy."
"Finally, I took advantage of the debate in plenary to challenge the Commissioner for Financial Programming and the Budget on the urgent need for a communication on the implementation of new own resources, which, I hope, will carry this debate forward."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this document, because under the auspices of enhanced European economic governance, the European Semester mechanism and Europe 2020 Objectives, the 2012 budget must boost growth and employment."
"The Europe 2020 Strategy should help Europe recover from the crisis and come out stronger, through smart, sustainable and inclusive growth based on the five EU headline targets, namely promoting employment, improving the conditions for - and public spending on - innovation, research and development, meeting our climate change and energy objectives, improving education levels and promoting social inclusion, in particular through the reduction of poverty."
"The difficult economic situation across the Union makes it more important than ever to ensure proper implementation of the EU budget, quality of spending and optimal use of existing Community financing."
"The EU budget has an instrumental role to play in helping the EU to exit the current economic and financial crisis through its capacity as a catalyst to boost investment, growth and jobs in Europe."
"in writing. - I welcome this report, which is of the opinion that the EU budget brings added value to national public expenditure when initiating, supporting and complementing investments in those policy areas which are at the core of Europe 2020."
"The European Parliament believes, moreover, that the EU budget has an instrumental role to play in helping the EU to exit the current economic and financial crisis through its capacity as a catalyst to boost investment, growth and jobs in Europe; takes the view that the EU budget could at least mitigate the effects of current restrictive national budgetary policies while supporting the efforts of national governments; stresses also that, given its redistributive nature, lowering the level of the EU budget may harm European solidarity and have an adverse impact on the pace of economic development in many Member States; believes that a purely 'net contributor'/'net beneficiary' approach does not take due account of spill-over effects between EU countries and therefore undermines common EU policy goals."
"In order to tackle the current economic and financial crisis it is essential to promote inclusive, sustainable European growth, aligning the European Union's budget with its main objectives."
"This report identifies a number of guidelines that will help to: promote employment; improve public expenditure on innovation, research and development; meet our climate change and energy objectives; improve education levels; and promote social integration."
"The European Semester, a new mechanism to strengthen European economic governance, should provide the chance to determine the best way to achieve these goals."
"It is essential to guarantee a certain level of coherence between the attainment of the results in question and the resources assigned to them at EU and national level, thereby improving synergies between European and domestic public investments."
"The European budget represents real added value, thanks to its ability to function as a catalyst to boost investment, growth and employment."
"The appropriations already planned must be kept at a suitable and flexible level of expenditure."
"Otherwise, their reduction would lead to the failure of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"We call on the Commission to develop ambitious proposals for the provision of new own resources, based on a comprehensive impact assessment, in order to bolster competitiveness and economic growth."
"I am in favour of the report by Mrs Balzani on the guidelines for the 2012 budget which, with the 2013 budget, will be consolidation budgets aimed at reflecting the Member States' spending cutbacks and setting a benchmark for amounts that will be established in the next financial framework."
"The contribution of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) to the guidelines for the 2012 budget was based on the concept of responsibility, which means pursuing the aims of economy, efficiency and effectiveness using as little as possible of the available resources."
"The 2020 Strategy is based on important priorities - namely research, innovation, development and growth - that were not initially contained in the report by Mrs Balzani, but which have been strongly emphasised by the PPE Group, as well as achieving the employment objectives initially set out."
"The Union's priorities in the budget require adequate financing and it is also important to ensure flexibility between the expenditure headings in order to more effectively counter the problems linked to the economic crisis, as well as to propose a budgetary framework that includes own resources."
"The Community budget for 2012 is the main tool for the EU to recover from the crisis and come out of it stronger, focusing on employment, economic governance and growth."
"The adoption of these general guidelines is an example of this."
"Employment, innovation, research and development, climate change and energy, training, and social inclusion are the five objectives which should form the focus for the drafting of the EU 2012 budget."
"Based on these five objectives, the Europe 2020 Strategy should help Europe to recover from the crisis and emerge from it stronger, through 'smart, sustainable and inclusive growth'."
"We must therefore oppose any attempt to limit the budget allocations for achieving the high-ranking objectives and flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"in writing. - The key requirements for the draft resolution on the EU general budget for 2012 are ensuring sufficient resources for the implementation of the EU-2020 Strategy and enhanced cooperation between European and national budgets."
"The 2012 EU budget should boost growth and high-quality employment, and start implementing the EU 2020 objectives."
"The motto for deciding on the EU 2012 budget should therefore be 'sustainability and responsibility' rather than 'austerity'."
"Although I voted 'for', I would like to stress that the budget should be distributed so that financial resources are used for the benefit of citizens in the Member States and not for the benefit of financial and political groups, as it is currently the case in Latvia, where officials distribute EU funds among their acquaintances and friends!"
"in writing. - (DE) The report on the 2012 budget refers to the Europe 2020 Strategy, which once again contains lofty goals that no one expects to meet."
"The fact is that the precarious budgetary situation of some Member States that have lived it up in the past has become a financial millstone around the necks of the other Member States in connection with the rescue package."
"It then often only needs something trivial to tighten the noose."
"These fundamental requirements make it all the more important not only for the 2012 budget to be correctly executed - in which regard we must not overlook the fact that budgetary control still leaves a great deal to be desired - but also for us to manage our resources in an economical way."
"The reference here to 'adequate financing' of the Europe 2020 Strategy, when billions from the EU budget are still mysteriously disappearing and available opportunities for potential savings, for example in relation to the jungle of EU agencies or the locations for Parliament, are not utilised, represents a waste of European taxpayers' money."
"On the basis of this conviction, I voted against the report."
"in writing. - (DE) The current euro crisis underlines the central importance of a correct and economical budgetary policy."
"The increase in funds on grounds that this is required for the Europe 2020 Strategy is something I reject, as for one thing the strategy is unachievable and for another it has inappropriate goals: for example the massive increase in the number of academics, when we actually have a shortage of specialist staff."
"Instead, we should utilise the numerous potential opportunities for savings, whether in relation to the decentralised agencies, the two locations of the European Parliament or the pre-accession aid for Turkey."
"I therefore voted against this report on the 2012 budget."
"As every year, we, along with other institutions, will be asked to adopt the EU budget."
"In view of this, I have voted in favour of the report on the general budget for 2012 because I agree with the main guidelines defined, namely: incentivising funds to promote growth and overcome the economic crisis by following the Europe 2020 Strategy; giving greater consideration to the European Semester as the ideal instrument for coordinating economic policies; not leaving room for differing availability in different sectors but using only the flexibility mechanisms of available funds by establishing a serious and rigorous management of the resources available for the allocation of funds."
"I voted in favour of the report on general guidelines for the preparation of the 2012 budget."
"The general principles and targets set out in the report are on the right lines, in emphasising that forthcoming EU budgets must focus on policies to boost employment and national economies (the total EU budget for implementing flagship initiatives up to 2020 is estimated at EUR 1.8 trillion)."
"Nonetheless, it is important to point out at every opportunity that the sine qua non to achieving the targets set in the Europe 2020 Strategy is their endorsement by the Member States."
"Unfortunately, according to the Commission's findings, national plans to date do not safeguard basic priorities of the strategy, such as increasing employment to 75% in 2020 from its current level of 69%."
"I voted in favour of this report on the general guidelines for preparing the 2012 budget."
"This is a budget for 2012 under the auspices of stronger economic governance, the European semester mechanism and the Europe 2020 objectives to encourage employment."
"Given that the Europe 2020 Strategy should help Europe to recover from the crisis and emerge from it strengthened through smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, based on the EU's five top objectives - namely by promoting employment; improving conditions and expenditure for innovation, research and development; meeting our targets in the areas of climate change and energy; improving levels of education; and promoting social inclusion, in particular by reducing poverty - I agree with the recommendations presented in this report, in order to fully attain these five objectives."
"I also agree with the rapporteur that there must be consistency between the achievement of these goals and the funding allocated to them, and the new mechanism for enhanced economic governance in the EU should be an opportunity to study how best to accomplish these five objectives."
"I voted in favour of this report, which sets out the general guidelines for the drafting of the 2012 budget, with a view to the trialogue on this subject, scheduled for 30 March 2011."
"On that matter, allow me to emphasise the need to properly assess the impact that the budget will have on the achievement of the EU's objectives and the implementation of the EU 2020 Strategy, as well as the role that budgetary policy should play in the area of investment, growth and employment."
"in writing. - (DE) It was not possible to give a roll-call vote on paragraph 29, as I was actively prevented from doing so by the usher."
"in writing. - A 2012 budget under the auspices of enhanced European economic governance, the European Semester mechanism and Europe 2020 objectives to boost growth and employment"
"1."
"Takes the view that the Europe 2020 Strategy should help Europe recover from the crisis and come out stronger, through smart, sustainable and inclusive growth based on the five EU headline targets, namely promoting employment, improving the conditions for - and public spending on - innovation, research and development, meeting our climate change and energy objectives, improving education levels and promoting social inclusion, in particular through the reduction of poverty; recalls that the Member States themselves have fully endorsed these five targets;"
"2."
"Points out that some consistency must be ensured between achieving these objectives and the funding allocated to them at European and national level; insists that EU budgetary policy must be in line with this principle; takes the view that the European Semester, as a new mechanism for enhanced European economic governance, should afford an opportunity to consider how best to deliver on these five headline targets;"
"This report outlines the general guidelines of the European Parliament on the 2012 budget and I believe that the text promotes sustainable growth to help overcome the economic crisis."
"Its redistributive approach consists of added value to the future public expenditure by Member States."
"According to financial planning by the Commission, the amount of committed funds will reach the sum of EUR 147.88 billion."
"In that regard, my country is in favour of strict management of resources in a context of expenditure restraint, especially in administrative costs, in line with the austerity policy implemented in its national budget."
"I hope now that the redistribution of available resources aimed at optimising their allocation is carried through to the end, in order to counter the effects of the international crisis that we are all experiencing in our daily lives."
"in writing. - On the budget vote for 2012 (General Guidelines) I voted to freeze the budget and against any indication of additional spending because of the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I believe the budget set to be adequate to the commitments set out under the Treaty as currently planned."
"I am not in favour of this report as the final version with the votes on the amendments is manifestly unfair, as it allows migrant workers to remain legally unprotected in some important areas such as social security."
"The EU should not allow this kind of treatment; when it comes to human rights, the EU should be a model."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution on a single application procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work."
"This document establishes a single application procedure for third-country nationals who wish to be admitted to the territory of a Member State in order to work there, and offers them a secure legal status."
"This will undoubtedly simplify the often complex administrative procedures for receiving economic migrants."
"I agree with the rapporteur's position that one of the best ways of combating illegal immigration and undeclared work is to develop balanced legal immigration channels which meet the needs of our labour markets."
"Economic immigration is a reality on which we must impose order, but it is also a necessity in view of the demographic and economic challenges which the EU will face in the near future."
"It is important to note that this proposal does not stipulate the conditions for admitting third-country nationals."
"Member States retain the power to decide these conditions and to set the number of migrants that they wish to admit to their territory for employment purposes."
"It is time for the European Union to legislate on economic immigration in order to establish an approach common to the 27 Member States."
"The changes brought about by the Treaty of Lisbon have made this progress possible, and it is now up to us to make it a reality."
"The European Union, a symbol of human rights around the world, must guarantee fair treatment of third-country nationals residing in its territory and establish an inclusive policy towards them."
"It has therefore been necessary to harmonise Member States' national laws relating to the admission and residence of those third-country nationals."
"That is why I voted in favour of this text which should help simplify admission procedures, fight against the unfair competition that takes place at the expense of European workers, and establish better control in the fight against illegal immigration and undeclared work."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for this text because I think that the European Union needs uniform administrative procedures for dealing with third-country immigrant workers."
"Adopting this act will have a significant beneficial impact."
"It will reduce public sector expenditure, discourage illegal immigration and ensure fair rights for third-country nationals wishing to work in the European Union."
"Economic immigration is a necessity which must be encouraged in a controlled manner, given the demographic and economic challenges which the European Union is going to face."
"Let us not forget that the progress made by countries such as the United States, Canada or Australia is due to immigrants."
"They belong to an extremely dynamic social group which brings additional enthusiasm and a fresh outlook in their approach in their adoptive societies, making the latter more competitive."
"In this respect, we must ensure that the conditions exist to allow them to work legally and that they have the chance to fulfil their dreams without being obstructed by pointless red tape."
"I would also like to hope that in the very near future, the issue of access to the entire European Union labour market for citizens from the Member States of Romania and Bulgaria as well will be resolved once and for all."
"Europe is facing the demographic problem of its aging population, and so it needs to look for manpower, which makes an important contribution to economic development, an increase in competitiveness and the vitality of the European economy."
"Europe will have to respond to its current and future manpower needs and provide a means to combat the exploitation and discrimination that workers often suffer."
"By creating a single application procedure for third country nationals who are seeking admission to the territory of a Member State in order to work there, and offering them a secure legal status, this draft directive responds to these needs and also simplifies the often complex administrative process."
"The power to determine the number of migrants seeking admission to their territory for the purposes of paid employment and the conditions for this admission continue to be the responsibility of the individual Member States."
"For all the above reasons, I voted in favour of this report."
"We have been talking for years now about creating a single permit for nationals of third countries who wish to live and work in a Member State."
"It was a commendable initiative at the beginning, but the text as it is contradicts the stated goals: it is both discriminatory, because the basic principle of equal treatment for all is not respected, and restrictive, since several categories of workers are excluded."
"Despite the improvements made since December 2010, there is a continued fear of social inequality among nationals of third countries."
"What is more, by voting in favour of the proposed 'single permit' for third-country nationals, the European right is voting for an immigration policy that is both discriminatory and restrictive."
"The text as it stands does not provide for equal treatment for all workers in terms of working conditions and social rights."
"It creates different categories of workers, by nationality and by type of contract, and this is simply unacceptable."
"We cannot compromise on equal treatment."
"We should say 'yes' to a common immigration policy, and 'yes' to a genuine single European permit, but we do not want a policy that is restrictive and therefore discriminatory."
"in writing. - (BG) I voted in favour of the proposal for a single application procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State because I think that the growing wave of immigration to the EU needs adequate regulation."
"The administrative requirements for admitting third-country citizens to work in the EU are excessively complicated and vague."
"Introducing a single-permit system will help improve the whole procedure, making it more efficient and far cheaper."
"We should not forget either that creating a single document will make it easier for local authorities to carry out checks on citizens arriving in the EU."
"Last but not least, I must say how pleased I am that the text voted on was supported by my fellow Members because it is designed to guarantee social and economic rights for immigrant workers, with the aim of avoiding social dumping or unfair competition inside the EU."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report, because the directive on a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work should be a general framework directive on rights for third-country workers, because only then will this European legislative act be able to contribute to the European Union goal of a common migration policy."
"Unfortunately, the position adopted by the European Parliament today on the directive on a single permit to reside and work has not improved the Commission's proposal for this directive."
"It has not been accepted that immigrant workers from third countries, who arrive here legally and do the same work as European Union workers, should enjoy the same rights and working conditions as local workers."
"It should be understood that legal migrant workers make a contribution to the EU economy through their work and the taxes and social security contributions they pay, therefore they must be guaranteed the same minimum rights and be treated in the same way in the labour market."
"I would like to stress that it is impossible to create a two-tier labour market, either within the European Union itself or outside."
"We cannot allow the creation of an underclass of workers in the EU labour market that faces discrimination and does not enjoy any rights or any guarantees, because this would lead to the erosion of all the social standards that have hitherto been won."
"Adopting the directive on introducing a single procedure for third-country citizens to obtain a work permit for the EU will simplify considerably the system which is currently decided on by each Member State."
"Two separate procedures entail a longer period for processing applications and higher administrative costs."
"This one-stop shop system will make the administrative procedure simpler, less expensive and quicker."
"In actual fact, issuing a single document will also make it easier to check on people admitted to a Member State and authorised to work there."
"This document will have the residence permit format common to all Member States."
"Member States will also be able to decide to introduce an additional document which will be of a purely informative nature."
"This will help supplement the information contained in the single permit, thereby facilitating monitoring."
"We are therefore dealing with advantages for every party involved - immigrants, employers and national administrations."
"Establishing a single application procedure will simplify the often complex administrative procedures for admitting economic migrants."
"This would provide an adequate response to the labour challenges which the EU is facing and will continue to face."
"in writing. - (CS) The benefit of the approved directive lies in the fact that it creates a unified approach to handling applications from third country citizens for permits to live and work in a Member State, and provides workers from third countries who are legally residing in the EU with a common set of minimal rights."
"The horizontal and framework character of the directive is unfortunately violated by the exemptions from the scope of the directive and variations regarding the rights of certain specific population groups."
"There has been an undermining of the principle of equal treatment for all third country workers legally working in the Union compared to EU citizens."
"This equality should be an expression of recognition of the benefit migrant workers bring to the EU economy through their work and also through their payment of taxes and social contributions."
"The accompanying effect should be a restriction on unfair competition, making the practice of illegal employment more difficult and preventing third country workers from becoming victims of exploitation and social exclusion."
"Contrary to the Commission proposal, it is therefore necessary to ensure that no specific group is excluded from the scope of the directive, and particularly not the group comprising temporary workers."
"The directive must specify the conditions of entry into the EU and any concrete rights, but it must not create a barrier to a situation where all legal migrant workers can enjoy fair and equal treatment, but, on the contrary, should secure and guarantee such treatment."
"This report marks a very important step for European Union legal migration legislation as it creates a single application procedure for third-country citizens."
"I welcome that the text adopted today makes no mention at all of the possibility of a Member State being able to introduce additional documents required by a third-country national to obtain a work permit."
"In addition, migrants will not become a burden on national social welfare systems because Member States will be able to decide that third-country citizens can have access to the social welfare system only after they have worked for a minimum of six months, while those who have come to study cannot claim these benefits."
"The one point which must be welcomed in this report is that it defines a set of common measures relating to third-country workers' rights, thereby facilitating the legal migration which the European Union needs."
"I welcome the call for Member States to produce correlation tables as this will enable us to verify the directive's proper transposition."
"I voted in favour of this draft report which allows a single residence and work permit for legal immigrants, provides a 'single permit' for third-country nationals and grants them rights similar to those of EU citizens."
"I agree with this proposal, which is aimed at simplifying administrative procedures and ensuring equal treatment between EU and immigrant workers for a range of social rights, such as access to social security."
"This measure will facilitate legal immigration when it is necessary in order to meet the needs of the European labour market."
"I voted against the directive on a 'single permit', because it is inspired by the Bolkestein Directive, which adopted the principle of the country of origin, thereby permitting different treatment of workers in respect of wages, terms, working times, social protection and so forth. The same approach is applied here to workers from 'third countries' outside the European Union."
"Different treatment has been adopted for European and non-European workers, thereby increasing competition between them and between foreign workers, depending on whether they are seconded or seasonal workers, students or residents."
"All these differences do is to increase exploitation and uncertainty."
"Despite moves by European trade unions and the progressive forces in Parliament to obtain full equality of rights for all workers, the text mainly reflects a compromise between the right and the socialists."
"The future directive will not apply to seconded workers or to students, will allow discrimination based on criteria such as knowledge of the language and will refuse family benefits to families of seasonal workers."
"Likewise, the call for the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrants and Members of Their Families has been removed."
"This proposal is aimed at responding to the concerns expressed in the Stockholm programme in order to create flexible immigration policies to support the development and economic performance of the EU."
"It is thus aimed and simplifying and harmonising the existing standards in the Member States by creating a single application procedure leading to one combined title encompassing both residence and work permit."
"This should make for a more efficient procedure and bring clear benefits for both employers and third-country nationals who want to immigrate to the territory of the Member States."
"It will ensure that these migrants have rights and obligations comparable to those of citizens of the EU in terms of working conditions, training and education, recognition of diplomas, social benefits, and so on. At the same time, it allows the lawfulness of their residence and employment to be monitored more easily."
"I therefore voted in favour of the excellent report presented to us by Mrs Mathieu."
"The European Parliament has voted in favour of the principle of creating a single work and residence permit for third-country nationals in a Member State."
"This procedure provides a set of common rights for these workers, particularly with regard to working conditions, such as working time and holidays."
"The text also sets out the principle of reimbursing pension contributions already made by workers who leave the EU, since they will be unable to receive their pensions after they retire."
"This text is problematic, however, since it reinforces the 'country of origin' principle for some categories of workers, a principle that was fought by the European left during the time of the famous 'Bolkestein' Directive."
"This principle creates a kind of two-speed labour market depending on the worker's origin, and contributes to a form of social dumping."
"There is a contradiction here: do we really want to protect the European social model, and should it exclude non-European workers, or should it take a universalist approach and stop discriminating against workers by giving them different rights?"
"This text does not yet resolve this fundamental issue, which is why I decided to abstain from voting on the text."
"in writing. - I voted against this report that seeks to establish unfair competition between EU workers and migrant workers coming to Europe."
"The 'single permit' directive, as amended today by Parliament at first reading, will apply to non-EU nationals seeking to reside and work in a Member State or who already reside legally in an EU country, with the exception of posted workers, seasonal workers, long-term residents and refugees, who will therefore not be covered by its anti-discriminatory provisions It is unacceptable that legal migrants coming to Europe to work are to endure worse working conditions than EU workers doing the same job."
"Once a migrant enters the EU and starts working, he stops being a migrant and becomes a worker."
"Therefore, he has the right to be treated as such, like any EU worker and regardless of his country of origin."
"There can be no exceptions."
"EU legislation must apply to all workers in the EU, regardless of their country of origin."
"We have been talking for years now about creating a single permit for nationals of third countries who wish to live and work in a Member State."
"It was a commendable initiative at the beginning, but the text as it is contradicts the stated goals: it is both discriminatory, because the basic principle of equal treatment for all is not respected, and restrictive, since several categories of workers are excluded."
"In December 2010, Members of the European Parliament rejected the text for the first time."
"Despite the improvements made since then, there is a continued fear of social inequality among nationals of third countries."
"The text as it stands does not provide for equal treatment for all workers in terms of working conditions and social rights."
"It creates different categories of workers, by nationality and by type of contract, and this is simply unacceptable."
"We therefore voted against the final draft."
"We remain in favour of a single European permit, but we do not want a policy that is restrictive and therefore discriminatory."
"The issue in question in this proposal is the introduction of a one-stage procedure to grant both employment and residency authorisation and the definition of a common set of rights to all nationals of non-EU countries who legally reside and work in the EU."
"This presupposes the existence of rules which are common to all Member States, something which would put an end to the current differences in approach of the various EU countries and which would make the process of giving legal status to workers quicker, more uniform and more transparent throughout the Union."
"While the legal migration of labour, and above all qualified labour, helps to fight clandestine working and can improve the competitiveness of the economy and overcome existing shortages, we cannot forget that, during a period of economic crisis and vulnerability where unemployment is growing, labour migration policy must be flexible, as argued by the Commission, but must also be sustainable and reasonable."
"in writing. - (PT) This report addresses an issue which needs to be discussed with increasing urgency."
"Indeed, the expected decrease in the number of Europeans making an active contribution requires the EU to open its borders to third-country nationals, so that they can live and work here; otherwise the current social security systems will fail."
"In 2004, the Hague programme, which focused on the need to combat illegal migration, recognised that legal migration would play a vital role in the economic development of the EU."
"The Stockholm programme adopted by the Council on 10 and 11 December 2009 acknowledged that the migration of labour can increase competitiveness and economic vitality."
"I therefore agree with the position expressed in this report on the proposal for a directive of Parliament and the Council on the regulatory amendment which is aimed at implementing a single procedure in order to grant authorisation to third-country nationals legally resident in one of the Member States, taking into account the demographic challenges which Europe is starting to face."
"Moreover, this is a process of simplification which is more efficient and economical."
"The proposal for a directive on a single application procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State, hinting at alleged improvements in the situation of workers from these countries, may in fact represent an attack on the rights of workers in general."
"Let us not forget that the proposal had its genesis in the country-of-origin principle established by the notorious Bolkestein Directive, which promoted the increase in inequalities between workers, particularly in terms of wages, and which was ultimately detrimental to all workers due to the pressure to level down working conditions."
"By attempting to establish disparities and differences in treatment between European workers and third-country workers, this proposal for a directive increases the segregation of immigrant workers and further weakens the situation for all workers, forcing them into a situation of greater instability."
"Basically, we may be facing an attempt to promote social dumping."
"In our view it is necessary to strengthen the rights of all workers, including immigrants, seasonal workers and posted workers."
"We therefore regret that restrictive measures are being insisted upon following the rejection of the first version of this report..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The adoption of the report on a single application procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State may constitute an attack on the rights of workers in general."
"The proposal has as its genesis the Bolkestein Directive, which established the country-of-origin principle, promoting an increase in divisions between workers, particularly in terms of wages, and which proved detrimental to all workers. By attempting to establish differences between European workers and third-country workers, this adds to the segregation of immigrant workers, widening differences in treatment and further weakening their living conditions through the vulnerability and instability of their working conditions."
"This proposal for a directive may promote social dumping and make labour relations more unstable."
"In view of this, it is necessary to strengthen the rights of all workers, including immigrants, seasonal workers and posted workers."
"However, the struggle of the workers in many European countries, particularly in Portugal, meant that the proposal for a directive was rejected at the last plenary session of 2010."
"We regret the insistence on restrictive measures..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. - (DE) Although overall it would be good if a residence permit and a work permit could be issued together, the following questions remain unanswered and the following remarks are necessary:"
"1."
"Application of the Posting of Workers Directive must take priority and the principle of the application of the social legislation of the country of employment must always be regarded as fundamental."
"2."
"No worker must be employed as legal 'cheap' labour under this measure, as this is damaging to our labour market and it is socially unjust."
"3."
"The countries must carry out more checks in these areas."
"After the report was initially rejected in plenary, the European right made mistakes in procedural manoeuvres, and has now shamefully contributed to the recognition of a two-speed job market that depends on the worker's origin; this will create social dumping and therefore exert a downward pressure on the level of protection of European workers, which is unacceptable."
"I therefore voted against the report which is nothing but an attack against the European social model."
"This text establishes exclusions and unequal treatment in social security, pensions and access to employment and training for legal migrant workers, which runs contrary to my values."
"in writing. - (LT) The Hague Programme recognised that legal immigration would play an important role in economic development."
"It was with this in mind that it called on the Commission to submit an action plan to enable the labour market to respond rapidly to the constantly changing demand for manpower from abroad."
"The Stockholm Programme adopted by the European Council on 10 and 11 December 2009 expressed the view that labour immigration may increase competitiveness and economic vitality."
"In view of the considerable demographic challenges which the European Union will face in future, with growing demand for manpower, this new multiannual programme calls on Member States to adopt flexible immigration policies in order to support the Union's long-term economic development and performance."
"The provisions in the proposal have the advantage of conferring better protection on workers from third countries than is currently the case on the basis of international conventions only ratified by certain Member States."
"I abstained because the proposal does not state who may submit an application - the employer or the employee - and from which State an application may be made, and it was necessary to clarify this important issue."
"It also failed to stress the requirements of legal certainty and transparency of decision making by national authorities."
"These decisions have a strong impact on the lives of the people concerned and Member States, and they must therefore be taken in a way which is completely transparent."
"Any rejection decision must be duly substantiated, transparent and objective."
"The draft resolution voted in Parliament today on the provision for a single application procedure for the issuance of a permit that would allow third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of the Union represents a further step towards the harmonisation of national laws of Member States."
"Establishing the same legal immigration measures in all EU countries, setting out common procedures for those who intend to apply for admission to the territory of a Member State for employment, will allow the EU to meet the needs for workers in domestic labour markets by providing, through the establishment of equal rights, a tool to fight exploitation and discrimination."
"I believe, nevertheless, that Member States should be allowed, under certain conditions, to set limits to the capacity to accept citizens from non-EU countries and offer them a job in their area."
"Obviously, the proposal has the aim of combating illegal immigration and clandestine employment, but it can and should be interpreted as a useful contribution to the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy, allowing also simpler border control."
"It has been some 20 years since the European Union established the internal market envisaged by the founding fathers."
"Its implementation has led to the increasingly advanced integration of a vast area of trade."
"However, that area still experiences unequal treatment between nationals of a Member State and those from third countries."
"This difference in treatment is a two-fold problem."
"It both penalises migrant workers, who do have the high expectations usually brought about by the social rights of Member States, and harms European workers who, faced with unfair competition, suffer from social dumping."
"The 'single permit' resolution, presented by Mrs Mathieu, specifically targets migrant workers' rights."
"It simplifies procedures by establishing a single permit for residence and work, and gives foreign workers rights and obligations comparable to those of European workers."
"The full establishment of the internal market is a powerful tool enabling Europe to return to growth, which is why I supported this text."
"in writing. - I voted against this report because key paragraphs on posted workers, pension rights and social security were defeated."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour of this report, which returns to the House for the second time, because I believe that it is a good response to the considerable demographic challenges that the European Union will face in the coming years, establishing a single application procedure for third-country nationals who wish to be admitted to the territory of a Member State for work purposes and offering them a secure legal status."
"Economic immigration is a reality that must be organised, but it is also a necessity with regard to the democratic and economic challenges which will face the European Union in the near future."
"Thus, immigration policy must be thought of as an instrument of adjustment regarding our workforce needs, thus contributing to the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"From a technical point of view, the exclusion of seasonal workers and workers transferred within their company is justified by the presentation by the Commission of proposals for specific directives for these workers."
"However, as regards the exclusion of asylum seekers and persons benefiting from international protection, it is important to emphasise that the existing tools in these areas provide greater protection than the present proposal."
"Now that this draft directive has been adopted, immigrant workers will have the same rights as national workers, at least in terms of remuneration and dismissal, health and safety in the workplace, working hours and holidays."
"This proposal is aimed at introducing a procedure to give a single residence and work permit to legal immigrants, and to grant them a common set of rights throughout the EU."
"It is thus possible to simplify the procedures so that the national authorities can grant a single residence and work permit for legal immigrants, so that they can benefit from a set of rights similar to those of the workers in the Member State where they are living."
"However, the admission of immigrants for the purposes of work, and the number of admissions, should remain the responsibility of the individual Member State."
"in writing. - (HU) We can best protect against illegal and irregular immigration if we try to prevent it."
"We could lend support to people to find a livelihood and social security in their countries of origin, that is, we could eliminate the causes of their emigration."
"If that is not feasible, we should create legal channels of immigration, which naturally also fulfil the needs of our own labour market."
"Economic immigration is a real phenomenon these days, which, on the other hand, is also a necessity, since with its help we can more readily defend against demographic and economic challenges."
"Consequently, we may consider immigration policy a regulatory means by which we can become able to control our labour needs."
"Through it we give opportunities to third-country immigrants who can legally enter the territory of the EU for the purpose of finding employment."
"The system of reception procedures would be significantly simplified by the creation of a merged procedure, which would confer the right of residence and employment at the same time."
"For this reason I, too, voted in favour of this horizontal legislative framework being created as soon as possible."
"By establishing a single application procedure for third-country nationals seeking to reside and work in the territory of a Member State, and by providing a secure legal status, this proposal for a directive will simplify the often complex administrative steps involved in receiving economic migrants."
"The existence of a harmonised procedure for issuing a single document that authorises residence and access to the labour market constitutes a significant simplification of the admission system."
"In addition, the proposal provides for treatment equal to that enjoyed by national workers and therefore has the advantage of giving better protection to third-country workers than they have at present."
"This status will also help fight against the unfair competition that often results from the absence of a protective legal status for these workers."
"The text adopted today also includes the two main priorities of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE): it removes any reference to additional documents and requests Member States to draw up 'correlation tables' enabling the Commission to verify the transposition of the directive."
"It is a clear sign of the willingness of the European Parliament to move towards a European legal framework for legal immigration."
"in writing. - The purpose of this directive is to enable potential immigrants into an EU Member State to obtain work and residence permits via a single procedure."
"Under the original proposal, non-EU workers would get equal treatment with EU nationals as regards pay and dismissal, health and safety at work and the right to join trade unions."
"The Employment Committee wants to extend those rights to include equal working time and leave, while clarifying workers' rights to social security and tax benefits."
"Non-EU workers would also be able to receive their pensions when moving back to their home country on the same terms as nationals of the Member State concerned."
"What is more, all EU Member States will issue single standard permission for residence and work."
"I disagree with this because the EU still has an unemployment problem, and therefore voted 'against'."
"in writing. - (DE) The entry and residence of third-country nationals are an issue, but in the past the rights in relation to these have been extended more and more."
"Thus, it is now the case that the autochthonous population quite rightly feels increasingly disadvantaged as a result of the access of third-country nationals to social services, specifically in the area of social housing."
"In the area of economic migration, it is mainly well educated and badly needed workers that move to other States."
"Whereas in the United States, for example, they do not burden the social system, and in some States they also have to leave once their job comes to an end, through the increasing level of equality with the resident population that they have been afforded in recent years, they constitute an ever greater burden for those States with traditionally well-developed social systems if they remain in the country permanently after losing their jobs and if, as a result of them bringing any family they have to join them, all the relatives have to be supported, too."
"This proposal is another step in this direction and therefore is to be rejected in the strongest possible terms."
"I wanted to express my vote against the report in relation to single residence permits for citizens of third countries because today, in the House, some amendments were voted to exclude the requirement for employment as being necessary in order to have access to benefits and social services."
"It seems to me to be a dangerous lowering of the minimum required standards and it enables a third-country citizen, obviously with a valid residence permit in the EU, to have access to the same working and social conditions as an EU citizen."
"If a European Union exists, it is to ensure, also, that the inhabitants of Member States that are its citizens can enjoy greater rights and guarantees than are called for in this report."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for this resolution because I think that non-EU workers should enjoy the same rights on work conditions as EU citizens, in accordance with the 'Single Permit' Directive."
"I would like to mention in particular at this point working time, leave and social insurance."
"The aim of this draft bill is to cut red tape and simplify the procedures for applying for residence and work in an EU Member State, both for migrants and their employers, by means of a combined residence and work permit."
"The proposal does not specify the conditions for admitting third-country nationals."
"Member States retain their power to set these admission criteria and the number of migrants they wish to admit to their own country with a view to taking up employment."
"The new rules will be applied to non-EU citizens already living legally in a Member State or wishing to do so."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Mathieu's proposal for a directive on the single application procedure for a residence and work permit for third-country nationals."
"I did so because I think it is important for Europe to equip itself with EU-wide rules to manage the influx of manpower from third countries, both for economic and social reasons."
"Labour immigration can increase the competitiveness and the vitality of the economy, helping Europe to tackle the future demographic challenge as well as possible."
"The proposal for a directive calls on the Member States to adopt flexible immigration policies to support the long-term development of the Union."
"In addition, it will simplify the often complex administrative procedures for receiving migrant workers, while also providing a tool to combat the exploitation and discrimination imposed on some categories of workers."
"I voted in favour of this Parliament legislative resolution on a proposal for a directive of Parliament and the Council on a single application procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State, and a common set of rights for third-country workers who are legally resident in a Member State."
"This matter is all the more relevant in the current economic and social situation."
"Indeed, one of the best ways of combating illegal immigration and clandestine working is to develop balanced channels for legal migration which meet the needs of our labour markets, along with the social requirements of successful integration into the host society."
"The Stockholm programme adopted by the European Council of 10 and 11 December 2009 calls on Member States to adopt immigration policies marked by flexible arrangements to support the development and economic performance of the Union."
"With this proposal, Parliament wishes to contribute to the implementation of this programme."
"It introduces, in particular, a single application procedure for third-country nationals wishing to be admitted to the territory of a Member State for employment, by: (i) simplifying the often complex administrative procedures for receiving migrants; (ii) defining an instrument for the prevention of exploitation and discrimination in the workplace; (iii) ensuring that labour markets of Member States will definitely be able to respond to the need for workers, now and in the future."
"The Directive applies to all citizens admitted to the territory for work and those who were initially admitted for other reasons and who have subsequently obtained a work permit in accordance with the provisions of national or EU law."
"This proposal, therefore, contributes to promoting a common approach from the 27 Member States with regard to economic migration, which is why I reiterate my vote in favour."
"in writing. - (RO) Economic immigration is a reality on which we must impose order, but it is also a necessity in view of the demographic and economic challenges which the EU will face in the near future."
"Immigration policy can be regarded as an instrument for regulating our labour needs, thereby helping to implement the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"Having a single procedure enabling a single document to be issued authorising residence and access to the labour market marks a considerable simplification of the admission system."
"The directive will apply not only to any third-country national admitted to the territory of a Member State for employment purposes, but also to all those who were originally admitted for other purposes but who have acquired the right to work there on the basis of national or Community law. Each Member State must lay down the conditions under which social security benefits are granted, as well as the amount of these benefits and the period for which they are granted."
"I regret that seasonal workers and workers posted within their undertaking are excluded from this directive, but I call on the Commission to table a proposal on this soon."
"Given the demographic challenges that Europe will face in the future, it is vital that the EU develops a balanced and flexible immigration policy which allows it to meet its labour needs and contribute to the competitiveness and vitality of the economy."
"The adoption of this directive, which establishes a single application procedure for third-country nationals who wish to be admitted to the territory of a Member State in order to reside and work there, and grants them a common set of rights in areas linked to the work market, will address these concerns head-on, and so it deserves my vote."
"in writing. - (FR) Today's vote in favour of the directive on a single permit for third-country nationals seeking to reside and work in a Member State is a further step towards achieving a harmonised immigration policy at European level."
"The idea of combining a residence permit and a work permit is good."
"It shows that the Union is genuinely committed to promoting legal migration and is not the European fortress that some people believe it to be."
"To achieve this, it was important for Parliament to support the idea of a single application procedure that is easier and faster for both the employer and the migrant."
"The European Parliament has also made the right choice by excluding four categories of workers from the field of application: seasonal workers, workers posted within their undertaking, self-employed workers, and seafarers, all of whom are already or will soon be covered by specific directives."
"Another positive point is the flexibility given to Member States as regards the effective rights of third-country workers."
"The 27 capitals will have the final say in determining whether or not to grant or withhold unemployment benefits and family allowances, and on the non-allocation of public housing during the first three years of residence."
"These are simple, common sense measures."
"in writing. - The directive as it stands excludes a lot of categories such as seasonal workers, intra-corporate transferees, refugees and posted workers, etc. I totally oppose the further segregation into categories of workers and the differential treatment granting some workers and their family members less rights than others."
"Even if some of these categories are covered by other directives, the example of the Commission proposal on seasonal workers shows that these directives are not sufficient in terms of rights."
"We should stand for a common framework for all workers, as it would unify the legislation in working places by avoiding fragmenting the workers' situation with the risk of jeopardising the integration of migrants and the cohesion in the EU."
"Even if very important issues such as the portability of pensions to third countries no longer being conditional on the existence of bilateral agreements have been won thanks to Jean, I cannot help thinking that we should advocate the equal treatment and non discrimination of all workers in the EU."
"That is why I have abstained."
"Today's vote represents a step towards the adoption of a single application procedure for third-country nationals seeking to enter European territory and work there."
"The European Union aims to simplify administrative procedures and to issue a single document for both residence and work permits."
"I want to emphasise that today's vote does not focus on indiscriminately attracting new workers to our territory, nor is its objective to combat illegal immigration."
"Every non-EU worker wishing to settle in Europe will still have to get a residence permit first."
"The proposal adopted today also confirms full observance of the principle of subsidiarity, by setting minimum standards on rights and obligations, but leaving Member States the flexibility and freedom regarding the introduction of procedures in their national legislation and their practical application."
"The European Union cannot limit the power of Member States in the organisation of social security, and each state must be allowed to establish its own rules in this area."
"in writing. - (NL) Although the directive on a single application procedure for a residence and work permit is far from being ideal or complete, I voted in favour of it nonetheless."
"I regret the shortcomings concerning seasonal workers, posted workers, the right to change employer and the right to enter and re-enter, because these subgroups will be protected in other (future) legislation."
"All in all, this directive is extremely important given that it is the first of its kind to grant a common set of minimum rights (including salary rights, equal treatment at work, pension rights and access to health care) to workers from third countries who are legally resident in Europe, which it does on the basis of equal treatment with national workers of Member States."
"In addition, the directive provides for a system with a single simplified application procedure for a residence and work permit."
"This scheme is far from a complete common immigration policy, but in view of increasing immigration flows, the constantly changing demand for foreign labour and the prevention of abuse and discrimination in this regard, this first form of protection is essential."
"Third-country workers will now receive greater protection than has been the case."
"Taken as a whole, this was the deciding factor for my 'yes' vote."
"in writing. - I voted against as I feel that it opens the door to unfair competition to EU workers and low-cost migrant workers coming to the EU."
"This report is aimed at establishing a single residence and work permit for third-country nationals in a Member State, and thus speed up and make more uniform the admission process, while also reducing its bureaucratic and financial burden."
"Economic migration is now a reality which should be analysed in view of the development of legal and balanced migration channels to meet the needs of European labour markets."
"The economic and demographic challenges which Europe is facing mean that a common immigration policy needs to be drawn up for the 27 Member States."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has established a new legal basis on this matter, the codecision process, and so I believe that it is vital to establish a common and harmonised approach in order to reduce the differences between national laws."
"Besides what has already been said, the proposal also provides for equal treatment for national workers, creating a secure and protective legal status, since the immigrants participate in the economic activity of the host country."
"Decisions that have been dismissed should be properly justified and transparent, and the costs should be commensurate with the services that are actually provided."
"The adoption of this report is a significant step forward in protecting the rights of third-country workers in the EU by granting them a single permit for residence and work."
"This illustrates the EU's willingness to enhance its attractiveness on the world stage by facilitating conditional access to the European labour market."
"I am pleased that the procedure for obtaining this permit has been simplified through a one-stop shop system, which will ease administrative procedures for foreign workers."
"The creation of a single working document represents significant progress in the control and regulation of migration flows from Member States and will enable legal immigration to be monitored more easily."
"With this text, Parliament has stated that controlled, regulated immigration of workers is beneficial to all."
"Establishing a common legal framework for European and foreign workers protects our citizens against all forms of unfair competition in the labour market."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because I support the idea of a Europe that protects its workers while remaining faithful to the principle of free movement of individuals, which is a cornerstone of the European project."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on consumer rights, which merges four existing Community directives in a single legal instrument."
"I agree with the rapporteur's opinion that the fragmentary nature of existing legislation deters consumers and undertakings alike from participating in cross-border trade."
"However, we must be cautious, because due to the nature of this area, it is rather difficult to fully harmonise legislation in the realm of consumer rights, and moreover, this may reduce the level of protection of consumer rights in certain Member States."
"In the face of recent digital developments, the EU should update consumer rights."
"This draft directive aims to provide better protection for consumers in all Member States of the European Union by enabling them, in particular, to enjoy an adequate right of withdrawal."
"Every citizen and consumer should be guaranteed the same rights within the Union."
"We will thus promote a level of consumerism that satisfies our citizens, who will find it easier to make purchases in other Member States."
"Furthermore, given that it preserves the vital acquis of French consumer law, such as the 'latent defect' guarantee, and the fact that all methods of payment are free of charge, I believe this new directive to be a step forward."
"I therefore supported it."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report which will be reconsidered by the parliamentary committee responsible."
"This directive is aimed at combining EU legislation regulating consumer rights, safeguarding a high level of consumer protection across all EU Member States and encouraging businesses to provide services and sell goods in other Member States."
"Currently there remain obstacles to the smooth functioning of the market."
"Companies are not inclined to trade in other Member States and consumers are unlikely to award contracts due to the different rules that apply to consumer contracts in the Member States."
"Legislation in force until now set only minimum requirements for the protection of consumer rights, and the Member States were able to apply more stringent measures, thus leading to different legal regimes in the Community."
"I believe that it is necessary to review this directive again and strengthen its provisions."
"We must ensure that the same standards of consumer rights protection apply in all EU Member States, enabling us to avoid the inconsistency that currently exists in the internal market, strengthen consumer confidence in the internal market and encourage companies to trade in other Member States."
"The proposal for a directive on consumer rights presented by the Commission combines four previous directives in a single legislative instrument."
"It is the result of revision of the acquis related to the consumer, which started in 2004 with the aim of simplifying and completing the existing regulatory framework relating to consumer protection."
"The current regulatory framework results in significant compliance costs for European companies that wish to operate across borders and have to comply with differing legislations."
"I believe the fragmentation of legal rules acts as a deterrent both to companies and consumers from buying or selling across borders."
"The report under discussion aims to achieve necessary balance between a high level of consumer protection and the competitiveness of companies in the insurance market, while at the same time respecting the principle of subsidiarity."
"Therefore I support the rapporteur's proposals that tend towards a kind of targeted harmonisation, that is to say harmonisation limited to specific aspects of certain contracts such as, in particular, information obligations or the right of withdrawal in remote or off-premises contracts, while managing to maintain a high level of protection for European consumers."
"I congratulate Mr Schwab for the work done so far."
"I voted in favour because the Schwab report has the merit of protecting consumers in their cross-border purchases."
"The text voted today, in fact, proposes guaranteeing a high level of protection for the consumers of the 27 Member States."
"At the same time, it seeks to protect and support companies, regardless of their size, which can provide goods and services to consumers in Europe without encountering unnecessary legal barriers."
"By bringing together four directives on this subject, we hope to harmonise the current rules in a more defined manner, avoiding the fragmentation of laws which is very often an obstacle for both consumers and businesses."
"In this sense, the document could contribute to a better functioning of the internal market by increasing consumer confidence."
"in writing. - (CS) The approved report sweeps away the fragmentary nature of existing regulations in the area of consumer protection, which ends up discouraging consumers and businesses from getting involved in cross-border trade."
"Consumers in particular often complain that they cannot make full use of the advantages of the single market, especially in relation to trading over the Internet."
"In my opinion, the correct response to these complaints is an approved set of common definitions, such as the concept of a consumer, a seller or a distance agreement."
"Also beneficial is the creation of a list of basic information to be provided by the seller before any kind of consumer contract is concluded, and the unification of the deadline for withdrawing from a contract at 14 days in the case of distance or off-premises contracts, including the creation of a single form for withdrawal from a contract."
"Unfortunately, in the case of this report we have seen how the left has, at the last minute, failed to support the compromise agreed with the rapporteur, and we have therefore had to put it to the vote."
"However, that is no disaster in my opinion, and on the contrary it is perhaps an illustration of the fact that the European Parliament works as a political body in which an open and genuine ideological conflict between the European right and the left unfolds."
"It would be useful if Parliament were presented in this way more often."
"In October 2008, the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive aimed at bringing together in one text the acquis on consumer protection, which covers four directives on unfair contract terms, certain aspects of sales and guarantees on consumer goods, consumer protection in distance sales and consumer protection in contracts concluded away from business premises."
"It is worth noting that these directives, which have been subject to revision, provide for minimal harmonisation clauses, which has led many Member States to maintain or adopt stricter rules on consumer protection, creating a fragmented regulatory framework throughout the Community with consequences in terms of the internal market, particularly for businesses and consumers in cross-border transactions."
"I believe that this legislative text, which was voted upon today, strengthens consumer protection while taking into account the characteristics of the sector, in which complete harmonisation may not always be feasible."
"I welcome the proposal for the creation of a mutual evaluation system, whereby the Member States must detail why diverging provisions of national law are essential and how they conform with the principle of proportionality and effectiveness."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The objective is very ambitious: it means to create a complete reform of consumer legal protection which addresses the entire subject of contracts and which brings into play the 27 national laws that provide different levels of protection."
"About a year ago, Prof. Monti said in his report to President Barroso: '...the legislator should find without delay an agreement on the draft directive on consumer rights, in order to ensure a high level of protection for consumers in an integrated retail market'."
"I fully agree with Prof. Monti."
"The absence of common rules in various Member States has given way to fragmentation of legal frameworks which is harmful for both consumers and manufacturers and in fact prevents the realisation of a common market."
"At a time of crisis like the one we are living through globally, Europe cannot afford to let its manufacturers lag behind and its consumers be insufficiently protected."
"It is therefore a matter of urgency that we come to an equitable common denominator in order to harmonise laws throughout Europe."
"We must all make an effort to reach an agreement with the Council, even at first reading."
"Consumer rights are one of the main pillars of the internal market."
"Their protection and security are vital to greater security in driving the acquisition of goods on a day-to-day basis for cross-border trade and, as a result, for the competitiveness of businesses."
"In this sense, a balance between consumer rights and the cost that these may impose on businesses is crucial."
"Moreover, it is important to bear in mind the different national characteristics and the protection that is offered, with due respect for the principle of subsidiarity."
"I therefore believe that this is an area where, on the one hand, maximum harmonisation may be useful, but, on the other, minimum harmonisation may also be adopted according to the type of contract, as being more appropriate."
"in writing. - (PT) This draft directive on consumer rights merges the four Community directives in force into a single legislative instrument."
"On the one hand, it is aimed at ensuring that consumers in all of the 27 Member States have confidence in a high level of consumer protection, and, on the other hand, that businesses, whether large or small, can provide goods and services without unnecessary legal obstacles to consumers in the 27 EU Member States."
"As for the consumers, this proposal aims to ensure that, no matter where in the EU they make their purchases, they have access to clear information about prices and additional charges before signing a contract."
"It strengthens consumer protection against late or non-delivery, giving consumers rights in relation to cooling-off periods, returns, refunds, repairs, guarantees and unfair contract terms."
"On all contracts concluded with consumers, the dealer is required to provide clear information that allows an informed choice."
"I am pleased with the exemption of the requirement to provide information for contracts that involve 'day-to-day transactions and in which the trader has to deliver the good or provide the service immediately when the contract is concluded', as this avoids an unreasonable administrative burden."
"This is yet another proposal by the Commission in which the promotion of cross-border trade appears to be the main motivation for exercising legislative initiative."
"In this case, and due to the fact that this is an unoriginal proposal for 'protecting the interests of consumers', it goes back to arguing that free trade is the be-all and end-all of consumer interests, thus making, once again, a profession of faith in the virtues of the free market."
"In truth, it is more relevant to the rights and interests of businesses than to those of the consumer."
"The Commission is advocating a total harmonisation of the rules laid down for consumers."
"If this harmonisation is not brought about by progress and by taking into account the legislation that is already in place in each country, in practice it could lead to the loss of consumer rights in some Member States where the legislation is more advanced in this field."
"As this is a first reading, and given that in the course of the debate in the committee it was possible to improve upon the Commission's initial proposal, we hope that it will be able to go even further in defending the rights of consumers."
"We are at the stage of the first reading of the draft directive on consumer rights, submitted by the Commission."
"This is focused on the promotion of cross-border trade, based on the principle that free competition is what best serves the interests of consumers."
"In fact, however, it gives more attention to the rights of corporations than to the rights of consumers."
"Moreover, the Commission advocated the total harmonisation of the established rules on consumers, without taking into account the legislation that is already in place in each country."
"This could lead to the loss of consumer rights in some Member States."
"There has been an intense discussion in Parliament's internal market committee, and it was possible to reach a broad consensus that allowed the initial proposal tabled by the Commission to be changed substantially."
"However, the conditions seem to be in place to go even further in protecting consumer rights by seeking to influence the negotiations with the Council in a positive way."
"We therefore agree with the rapporteur's request to return this report to Parliament's internal market committee."
"in writing. - (DE) Facilitation of cross-border trade by means of uniform rules and at the same time a strengthening of consumer rights, above all in connection with purchasing goods in another Member State, are the reasons why I expressly welcome the 'new' Consumer Protection Directive."
"The current uncertainty that still remains with regard to the applicable consumer rights deters companies from offering their goods across borders and consumers from ordering these goods, as there is a lack of clarity over what happens in the possible event of withdrawal."
"A European single market expressly requires the removal of such barriers."
"The uniform definitions proposed in this report, which among other things harmonise the withdrawal right and rules relating to unfair contract terms in contracts, will create legal certainty and thus increase the appeal of cross-border trade for companies, which will ultimately benefit consumers."
"Chapter V was not adopted and therefore consumer protection will be applied throughout Europe according to the highest criteria."
"Referral back to committee is therefore necessary in order to negotiate with the Commission once again."
"Faced with a text that was more than questionable at the outset, I am delighted that some major progress has been made by the European left."
"It was indeed absurd to impose on Member States legislation that goes against consumer rights and to force them to revoke some of their national laws that were considered too protective in relation to the directive."
"However, I voted in favour of deferring the final vote in order to strengthen consumer protection against certain abusive practices, for which the chosen level of protection remains insufficient."
"In any event, I will not vote in favour of a text that violates the most basic consumer rights."
"in writing. - (SV) The amendments tabled by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection are, unfortunately, of poor quality from a purely legislative perspective, and Chapters II, IV and V are superfluous."
"Amendment 141 is unreasonable for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In the compromise proposals (block II), the restrictions on distance and direct selling are unreasonable and unacceptable."
"in writing. - The Commission's original proposal for a consumer rights directive was an unwelcome, unnecessary attempt to enforce maximum harmonisation for no apparent reason other that to satisfy those who believe that cultural and legal diversity runs counter to the EU's principles."
"The proposal would have led to a reduction in consumer rights in various European countries and there was no evidence it would have benefitted the market."
"The compromise package agreed in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is far from perfect but marks a significant improvement and a base upon which we can build in negotiations with the other institutions."
"in writing. - (DA) I am pleased that, after more than two years of negotiations in Parliament, we have succeeded in agreeing on a position which both strengthens consumer rights in the EU and makes it easier for enterprises to operate on the internal market."
"On account of the decision to vote on the amendments in blocks, many of us are unhappy about the fact that we were not able to vote against certain amendments."
"Allow me to highlight the following cases."
"Chapters 4 and 5: I would have liked a compromise, with Chapters 4 and 5 being completely removed from the proposal."
"I know that the Council in particular, but also the European Consumers' Organisation (BEUC) and the Danish Consumer Council, would have preferred that to the compromise we currently have with regard to these two chapters."
"In this connection, we have to smile at the fact that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have chosen to ignore the recommendations of the consumer organisations."
"Article 22a: I would also have liked to delete the much-criticised Article 22a."
"It does not make things particularly easy for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"However, I am more confident than my fellow Liberal Members from Germany that we will probably succeed in amending this provision during the negotiations with the Council."
"One idea was to bring this article into line with Article 20 of the Services Directive, which would also reduce the risk of contradictory legislation."
"in writing. - (RO) According to the EU 2020 Strategy, high-quality and environmentally sustainable production is one of the EU's competitive advantages."
"A high level of consumer protection guarantees high-quality products and improves consumer confidence, thereby making the internal market more effective."
"I welcome the proposals tabled by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on a new consumer rights directive as they strive to ensure transparency for companies, with the aim of unlocking the potential of cross-border trade in the EU."
"The new consumer rights regulations include almost every type of sales, in stores, via telephone or online."
"They reinforce in particular the provisions on international sales, based on the proposals made in the report drafted by my colleague Andreas Schwab."
"Unlike the four existing consumer protection directives, I think that the new legislation provides added value because it stipulates what kind of information the purchaser must receive from the seller, the delivery terms and the rules applied when the risk lies with the purchaser, not to mention the latter's right to cancel or refuse purchases or the right to have an item repaired or replaced."
"in writing. - I voted to send this report back to committee because the Commission's response to Parliament's amendments was woefully inadequate."
"in writing. - (IT) The Commission's proposal aims to improve the functioning of the internal market by reducing trade barriers across borders, but poses problems for both consumers and manufacturers."
"It should support all efforts aimed at making the internal market more effective and encourage cross-border trade, but Article 38 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights requires that EU policies ensure a high level of consumer protection."
"It is therefore necessary to aim to increase the minimum level of current harmonisation by applying available best practices."
"It will be appropriate to develop a European system of liability in the event of non-compliance to improve consumer protection and confidence in the markets."
"In line with the Europe 2020 Strategy, their high level of protection ensures quality products and at the same time fosters the performance of the internal market."
"Regarding the rights of consumers, the current minimum regulations allow Member States to adapt European regulations to national principles: we should proceed further in this direction."
"Unfortunately however, we note that the proposed directive does not take into account new products on the market due to changes taking place in development and innovation, as in the case of digital products."
"I cast my vote in favour of the report on consumer rights by Mr Schwab because I see the need to simplify and complete the existing legal framework relating to consumer protection."
"It is essential that consumers of the 27 Member States can rely on a high level of protection and that manufacturers, regardless of their size, can provide their goods and services to consumers in the 27 Member States without having to deal with unnecessary legal barriers."
"Parliament's action is necessary both to strengthen consumer confidence and to encourage and support manufacturers wishing to engage in cross-border trade."
"The diversification of rules on consumer rights in Europe is a serious deterrent to manufacturers even in their buying and selling of goods and services across borders."
"In particular, e-commerce is an area where consumers cannot benefit from the internal market nor from their consumer rights, which is due to the fact that manufacturers in a given sector are reluctant to comply with different rules as they enter a new market and thus run the risk of being sued in another Member State."
"I voted in favour of the report on consumer rights."
"The text replaces four existing directives with one, with a view to simplifying and improving the regulation of consumer protection."
"The added value of the European Union must translate into a clear benefit for consumers by facilitating cross-border online transactions in particular."
"The proposal for a directive thus seeks to address issues raised by consumer protection rules that differ from one country to the next."
"Specifically, the text proposes a model withdrawal form for distance contracts and off-premises contracts, and the period of the right of withdrawal is harmonised at 14 days."
"Similarly, the rules contained in the text would enable consumer rights to be strengthened with regard to information and delivery."
"in writing. - (DE) In today's vote on the text of the directive on consumer rights, some members of the German Free Democratic Party (FDP) in the European Parliament abstained."
"The compromise adopted undoubtedly contains many improvements on the original draft from the European Commission."
"For example, we have succeeded in ensuring that small businesses are not affected by most of the new rules or burdened with additional bureaucracy."
"However, the text adopted today also contains rules that would heavily burden companies without increasing consumer protection."
"Article 5, for example, will mean that a company will have to provide very extensive pre-contractual information even when goods are purchased in store."
"This will hardly benefit consumers, as they can assess the product directly in the shop."
"Article 22a places companies under obligation, in the case of distance contracts, to supply their goods to customers in any Member State."
"Such an obligation contradicts the freedom of contract and exposes small and medium-sized enterprises in particular to considerable legal and financial risks."
"Furthermore, the FDP was unable to succeed in its core demand for the complete deletion of Chapters IV and V of the directive."
"The FDP calls for these provisions to be amended during the trilogue negotiations with the Council and Commission."
"This proposal involves the replacement of the four directives currently in force on contracts concluded away from business premises, unfair terms, distance contracts and the sale and guaranteeing of consumer goods into a single piece of legislation."
"The aim of this draft directive is to increase the confidence and protection of consumers in the purchases that they make in shops or on the Internet, and to reduce the reluctance of businesses to sell in other EU countries."
"The draft directive on consumer rights is aimed at ensuring that, no matter where in the EU they make a purchase, consumers have access to clear information about prices and additional charges before signing a contract."
"In general, all contracts are covered, whether a purchase is made in a shop or at a distance, or away from the business premises."
"This directive will strengthen the internal market."
"in writing. - The aim is to increase the confidence of shoppers and provide transparency for businesses so as to unleash the potential for growth in cross-border commerce within the EU."
"The new rules will cover almost all sales made in shops, by phone or online but will particularly strengthen the rules on cross-border transactions."
"Buyers will know what information they are entitled to receive from the seller, and rules on deliveries will be spelt out."
"There will also be clear rules on precisely when risk is passed on to consumers as well as on customers' rights to cancel a purchase, change their minds or have a product repaired or replaced."
"I would like to add that public transport and air transport tickets should be covered by rules on consumer rights."
"For example, I could cite the case of airBaltic where passengers' rights are being ignored and the company refuses to accept responsibility for poor-quality service."
"in writing. - (DE) There are indeed a few points that speak in favour of the directive on consumer protection, such as improvement of the obligations to provide information, extension of the withdrawal period and also the increased obligations for sellers to provide protection in the case of online shops."
"Consumer protection must be increased even more in order to create a foundation of trust between seller and consumer."
"There are a few reasons why I abstained in the vote, namely that in my opinion inadequate sanctions are provided for, no right of withdrawal is planned in the case of Internet auctions and, above all, the definition of doorstep selling is very vague."
"in writing. - (DE) This report concerns the bringing together of four different directives on consumer protection and thus contains the acquis communautaire since 2004."
"In some areas there are simplifications and additions."
"It is important that any higher standards of protection in the Member States are able to be retained."
"On the other hand, the bringing together of the directives results in more extensive harmonisation."
"Therefore, I have abstained from voting."
"I have voted in favour of the report by Mr Schwab as I believe that the report represents a fair balance between protecting consumers on the one hand, who must be protected from fraud and unorthodox behaviour by manufacturers and third parties, and, on the other, avoiding regulations that are too stringent for manufacturers, by imposing obligations which, given the size of their business and turnover, they sometimes cannot put up with."
"Take the case of a craftsman who, in theory, can work outside business premises: he cannot be subjected to the same requirements as a large multinational company which manages and concludes thousands of contracts every day."
"Harmonisation that is focused and balanced, taking into account the peculiarities of the European manufacturing base while preserving consumer protection, is therefore the way forward."
"I voted in favour because I believe that the codification of consumer rights in a single document is a positive step."
"It is worth highlighting the reduction of barriers to cross-border trade and commending the attempt to make the internal market more effective and promote cross-border trade through a combination of four directives that are now consolidated into one."
"The draft directive does contain aspects that can and should be improved, but it is a very positive development in this area nonetheless."
"The Commission's proposal concerning consumer rights, filed on 8 October 2008, aims to unite the four previous directives in a single instrument on the basis of the principle of 'full harmonisation'."
"The fragmentation of rules is, in fact, considered a deterrent for both consumers and businesses who buy or sell across borders."
"Given the situation regarding the consumer acquis, the approach in favour of complete harmonisation in this proposal is not practicable at present."
"Therefore, it is necessary to correct its scope by making a structural change."
"In line with the resolution of Parliament and with the statement made in the working document of the Committee for Internal Markets and Consumer Protection in 2009, a new approach based on full harmonisation is preferred, that is to say harmonisation limited to specific aspects of certain contracts while maintaining a high level of consumer protection."
"Based on the above, I hereby give my favourable vote to ensure ever greater protection of consumer rights."
"in writing. - (DE) I am pleased with today's decision on consumer protection."
"We have taken an important decision for Europe's citizens, enterprises and the single market."
"It is heartening that it was possible to find a sensible approach for a partial standardisation of the multitude of European systems of law."
"Nevertheless, from an Austrian viewpoint there are a few problematic points which now urgently need to be discussed and clarified in the trilogue negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission: (1) The 'procurement element' must be included in the text."
"Procurement element means, for example, that if someone asks a beautician to come to his or her house in order to utilise the beautician's services (in other words the person procures the business connection him- or herself), the right of withdrawal should no longer apply."
"(2) We need to ensure that no additional burdens for SMEs arise, provided that adequate consumer protection is ensured."
"Ultimately, additional financial and administrative burdens on SMEs would be passed on to customers."
"(3) Chapters IV and V (liability and unfair terms) should be deleted, because even after lengthy negotiations it was not possible to achieve the desired full harmonisation."
"Deletion would avoid a standstill and open up the way for new possibilities in the trilogue negotiations."
"(4) With regard to the welcome rule on Internet scams, a few adjustments still need to be made in order to ensure a balance between consumer protection and the burdening of businesses."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the compromise package on consumer rights negotiated between the groups, because it was possible to introduce some improvements to the directive compared with the Commission's proposal."
"It is important that the basis of the directive is once again minimum harmonisation and services like those in the health or social sphere are removed from the directive."
"There was also an improvement in the area of distance selling, where the withdrawal period for consumers has up to now been a week, but under the European Parliament's amendments two weeks would now be provided for."
"Purchases at trade fairs are now also classed as direct selling."
"In Austria, a purchase at a trade fair has up to now been treated, from a legal point of view, in the same way as a purchase in a shop."
"However, some important points still need to be improved."
"The highest priority in this regard is Chapter V of the directive, with which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is completely dissatisfied. We must prevent the list of unfair contract terms from being exhaustive - the Member States should not be prevented from extended their level of consumer protection."
"Many consumers in Member States with a long tradition of consumer protection would otherwise find their protection worsening."
"I have therefore also voted for referral back to committee, so that these essential points can also be resolved and improved."
"in writing. - (FR) A well-protected consumer is a citizen at ease and a sign of maturity in our modern democracies."
"It is this that makes the directive adopted today important."
"Not a day passes in which the European consumer, when choosing to make an online purchase or accepting an amendment to a subscription on the telephone, is not faced with a question as to the conformity of the contract he has signed or approved."
"It is in response to the often unequal relations between professionals and consumers that the European Parliament has opted for a right of withdrawal set at 14 days."
"This is a clear signal for the same rights to be exercised throughout the Union."
"It is true enough that the adoption of the Schwab report does not fully satisfy either consumer groups opposed to the principle of full harmonisation or the representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises and chambers of commerce who wanted the legislation to be restricted to boosting e-commerce."
"The European Parliament has opted for compromise and has not yielded to the siren voices of alarmists."
"It can take comfort in this choice from the recent European survey, which has shown that 79% of traders surveyed consider that the legislation that has been adopted will have little impact on their foreign sales."
"in writing. - We, the Greens/EFA, wanted to ensure minimum harmonisation for all EU consumers."
"This would allow Member States to introduce or maintain higher levels of protection than the EU 'average'."
"In addition, we wanted to ensure a high level of protection for all consumers."
"We were of the opinion that a good legislative proposal would be a good example to show citizens that the EU has their interests at its heart."
"Following much hard negotiation and misunderstanding, we made good improvements to the text, notably the inclusion of digital content, the exclusion of health and social services, the inclusion of legal as well as natural persons and good provisions for withdrawal rights and passing of risk."
"However, we voted against in IMCO as the flaws remaining were too large."
"We could not accept a text that would mean a reduction in consumer protection for any EU citizen."
"The text was not fully subject to minimum harmonisation, and the text of individual Articles was neither clear nor good enough to ensure that there would be no reduction in consumer protection for some EU citizens."
"After today's vote in the EP, the text is back with the Commission."
"Europe's task is to protect the interests of citizens and consumers in Europe and today the House finally recognises the just protection of these rights."
"Until now, consumers have all too often risked being the victim of the market's deceit and fraud, particularly due to their limited knowledge of their rights."
"With the adoption of this resolution Europe expects all consumers to have clear and precise information, which will enable them to make informed and targeted choices."
"Greater protection will be given, especially for online sales, and all citizens who have purchased a product which turns out to be different from what they wanted can request a replacement, a price reduction or cancellation of the contract."
"All contract conditions deemed unfair will be listed in a proper 'black list' and may not be used in any type of contract."
"Historically, Europe bases its foundation on the single European market."
"Establishing common guidelines appears, now more than ever, to be a priority for our institutions: only then can you guarantee increasingly freer trade for all European citizens."
"in writing. - I welcome the implementation of rule 57 with the report returning to the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection as this will ensure greater consumer protection."
"The Commission is seeking to simplify and complete the regulatory framework on consumer rights, and it is therefore proposing the fusion of the four existing directives into a single legislative instrument."
"On the one hand, this proposal envisages giving consumers throughout the 27 Member States a high level of confidence in the protection of their rights, and, on the other hand, envisages that the entities that provide goods and services will reduce the legal and administrative obstacles to cross-border sales."
"The adoption of this report is another step towards the full achievement of the internal market, since the existing legal fragmentation is a deterrent for both consumers and businesses when they want to conduct cross-border trade."
"The proposal allows for full harmonisation, aimed at contracts signed away from business premises and distance contracts, particularly transactions carried out online."
"At the same time, the rapporteur includes flexibility clauses that allow the Member States to maintain a high level of consumer protection."
"The application of a set of rights and duties for consumers and businesses under a single legal framework will enable a simplified network for the growth of internal market transaction."
"in writing. - (LT) The new rules intended to renew current EU legislation on consumer rights need to cover all types of purchases, whether they are made over the telephone, online, in a shop or at home."
"The amendments should boost consumers' confidence when making purchases in other countries and ensure the same conditions for companies, thus fully exploiting the potential of the common market."
"On the other hand, the new rules must be balanced in such a way that they do not become an intolerable burden for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Consumer protection is very important."
"Only by taking levels of consumer protection seriously, will it be possible to achieve full harmonisation."
"It is also important for citizens to know their rights."
"This is a problem throughout Europe, but particularly in my own country."
"According to data from the Eurobarometer poll, initiated by the European Commission, the vast majority of Lithuanians would like to learn more about their rights as consumers."
"According to the poll, two-thirds of Lithuanians (66%) believe that the Lithuanian legal system does not provide adequate protection by issuing penalties to companies which deceived or defrauded them."
"The message is clear. We cannot ignore it."
"Statistics also demonstrated that people have little confidence in the government and EU information offices - less than 7% of Lithuanians trust these institutions which provide them with correct information and advice on consumer rights."
"We cannot leave things as they are."
"The EU must act now."
"I support this report because communications, infrastructure and electronic services are essential in today's society, and because the European Network and Information Security Agency has done important work, still underway, particularly on cybersecurity."
"Extending its mandate and responsibilities therefore makes sense."
"The European Network and Information Security Agency plays a specific role in supporting Member States in their efforts to cooperate in this area at EU level."
"Information and communications technologies have become key elements in our economy and society as a whole."
"They are vulnerable to threats which no longer respect national borders, as a result of their interconnection with and interdependency on other infrastructures and the inability to guarantee their security and resilience based on purely national approaches."
"The report focuses on protecting Europe against cyber attacks and disruptions to IT systems by increasing the level of preparation, security and resilience."
"I voted for this report as it aims to develop an IT network and data security culture which will benefit citizens, businesses and public sector organisations in the European Union."
"I believe that the European Network and Information Security Agency's mandate is needed to enable the European Union, Member States and stakeholders to develop a level of preparation and the capacity to prevent and detect network and data security problems, and to respond to them more effectively."
"Even though the mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) expires on 13 March 2012, the European Union must still take measures in this area."
"It was therefore necessary to adopt an extension of the Agency's mandate, which would guarantee coherence and continuity on the issue of network and information security."
"This explains why I voted in favour of this text."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report extending the mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) until the adoption of a new regulation on this agency's revised provisions and principles at work."
"ENISA was established in 2004 for an initial period of five years, with the main goal of ensuring a high and effective level of network and information security within the Union, thus contributing to the smooth functioning of the internal market."
"Recent cyber attacks in the Member States are making us rethink and reformulate the Agency's mandate to attain a more flexible response capability and to bolster the Agency's operational efficiency."
"Giving all EU citizens the opportunity to use digital technology, and ensuring confidence in the Internet and its security, is one of the key objectives of the Digital Agenda for Europe."
"Once ENISA has been modernised, the latest information will be gathered from European countries, there will be encouragement to share best practices and the European Union and the Member States will be better prepared to prevent, detect and respond more effectively to network and information security problems."
"in writing. - (BG) I supported Giles Chichester's report on establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency as regards its duration because I think that information and communications technology (ICT) has become the backbone of the European economy and society as a whole."
"ICT is vulnerable to threats which come from outside national borders and change as the technologies and market evolve."
"Since ICT is global, interconnected and dependent on another infrastructure, its security and resilience cannot be guaranteed based on purely national and uncoordinated approaches."
"At the same time, the challenges associated with network and information systems are rapidly evolving."
"Network and information systems must have effective protection against any kind of intrusion and outages, including attacks carried out by people."
"I voted in favour of this report since I agree with the need to extend the mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency."
"This body, established by the European Union in 2004 for a five-year term, now needs a further extension in order to make it relevant to present-day needs and security risks."
"Indeed, the increasingly heavy use of computer communication facilitates the work of many, but is often also a danger, especially for children."
"Precise rules are needed to protect users."
"However, changes to the regulation require more time, and this is why it is necessary to extend the mandate of the Agency."
"I decided to vote for this report as I feel it is necessary to extend the mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency until 2013."
"This agency was set up for a period of five years in March 2004, which was then extended until March 2012."
"The main objective was to guarantee effective security for the EU's IT networks."
"Since we are living in a world which has become increasingly dependent on the Internet, we must increase our awareness of the problem of Internet security as cybercrime is not merely virtual, but has a real impact on our lives."
"This issue also features on NATO's agenda, resulting in an EU-US working group being set up to tackle IT crime and security, which marks a very important step in protecting the IT infrastructure."
"I truly believe that we still need the European Network and Information Security Agency."
"in writing. - I was delighted to vote in favour of the extension of the mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) until September 2013."
"This agency was established in 2002 for an initial period of five years."
"ENISA's mandate is important as it was set by the EU to carry out very specific technical and scientific tasks in the field of information security."
"It is important to have such an agency in place in order to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market that concretely affects the daily lives of the citizens and business alike, using broadband, online banking, e-commerce and mobile phones."
"Given the fact that attacks on information systems are constantly increasing, it is a critical time to have effective security measures in place in order to protect the integrity of Europe's information systems."
"A top-down EU approach is required to protect the information society sector."
"Member States cannot do this sufficiently by themselves."
"It is estimated that the necessary funding for the extension of ENISA's current mandate would be EUR 12.698 million in commitments."
"Network and information security is a growing concern not only for political decision makers, but for all those who increasingly use it to interact with each other and with the state authorities."
"The same care and attention that once guided public efforts to prosecute violation of correspondence should now be required for the security of the new forms of communication."
"These are more sophisticated, and so they need to be monitored constantly and updated continuously."
"I agree with extending the mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency by 18 months, as proposed by the Commission and voted upon by the parliamentary committee, so as to allow a rich and fruitful discussion between the European institutions, involving the people, about the challenges, priorities and responsibilities of the agency, and at the same time to avoid the legal vacuum that would be caused if the mandate were not extended."
"in writing. - (PT) This report focuses on a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 460/2004, which established the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA)."
"ENISA was created in 2004 with an initial period of five years, and was aimed at supporting the functioning of the internal market by controlling network security and ensuring the flow of information within the EU."
"With widespread access to computer facilities and the streamlining and flexibility of networks came the first attacks by so-called hackers, jeopardising the security of networks and information."
"Recently, the world has been shocked by the revelations made by the Wikileaks website."
"In March 2009, the Commission asked ENISA to support the Member States in their protection against cyber-attacks and disturbances."
"In July of the same year, the Member States supported the extension of ENISA's mandate."
"Given that issues linked to network security and the flow of information have a key role in the Digital Agenda for Europe (Europe 2020), I would like to express my agreement with the extension of ENISA's mandate by another 18 months."
"We recognise the importance of network and information security in the many areas of activity in which these are socially relevant today."
"However, the mechanisms that ensure this security cannot be decoupled from the political and social context in which they are developed and implemented."
"In particular, we cannot ignore the fact that the inherent approach for enhancing security and monitoring cyberspace have not always properly ensured that there is respect for the rights, freedoms and guarantees of the public."
"We believe that it is particularly significant that the EU is funding research programmes of large multinationals which dominate the technologies that allow governments to spy on Internet users, while creating and developing agencies such as ENISA, which will pay for the use of these same technologies."
"As the Internet is acknowledged to be one of the most important public spaces in the 21st century, it is important to make the most of it, rather than opening the way for the appropriation of this space for economic power, and thus using the benefit of the few, at the expense of the vast majority and its use in the advancement of social progress."
"The extension of the mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) and the strengthening of its resources, supposedly in the interests of a higher level of security for information networks within the EU, is part of an approach towards enhancing security which does not always properly respect the rights, freedoms and guarantees of the public."
"We must beware that a tool for oppressing and repressing the people is not created in the name of greater monitoring of cyberspace."
"The Internet and its various tools are not in themselves oppressive."
"The issue that arises is the political and social context in which they are used."
"In view of this, it is particularly significant that the EU is funding research programmes of the large multinationals which dominate the technologies that allow governments to spy on Internet users, while creating and developing agencies such as ENISA, which will pay for the use of these same technologies."
"The Internet is recognised as being one of the most important public spaces in the 21st century."
"However, all this care is not enough to prevent the appropriation of this space, which was created by human knowledge, from serving policies that are subject to economic power and facilitating its private use..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. - It is appropriate that we vote on Mr Chichester's report on a day when we have learned that the EU's institutions have been subjected a large-scale cyber attack."
"Information security is of increasing importance to all our citizens and I was happy to vote in favour of this report."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this document, because the European Union Presidency's Conference Conclusions at the Ministerial Conference on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection held in Tallinn stress that in order to address new and long-term problems in the future, we need to rethink and reformulate the mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), to attain a more flexible response capability, to develop skills and competences, and to bolster the Agency's operational efficiency and overall impact."
"This would render ENISA a permanent asset for each Member State and the European Union at large."
"The Commission is proposing a Regulation extending the current mandate of the Agency for 18 months to allow sufficient time for debate on a review of the Agency's new provisions."
"ENISA was established in March 2004 for an initial period of five years by Regulation (EC) No 460/2004[1], with the main goal of ensuring a high and effective level of network and information security within the European Union, and in order to develop a culture of network and information security for the benefit of the citizens, consumers, enterprises and public sector organisations of the European Union, thus contributing to the smooth functioning of the internal market."
"Regulation (EC) No 1007/2008[2] extended ENISA's mandate until March 2012."
"The proposed amendment to Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 which established the ENISA (European Network and Information Security Agency) and its duration, can only have my absolute support."
"I voted in favour of this proposal because I am convinced of the importance of its work regarding the safety of communications, and of putting in place the jurisdiction assigned to it for the fight against cybercrime, as provided by the amendment."
"In fact, extending its duration will, in my opinion, avoid the risk of a dangerous gap in the law."
"Well aware that the work carried out by ENISA has significant community interest, I hope it will receive increased resources."
"in writing. - I voted for this Report on the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency as regards its duration."
"I welcome the first reading agreement."
"in writing. - (IT) Information and communication technology (ICT) is now an integral part the economy and society of the European Union."
"Today, due to the continuing evolution of media and information systems, ICT is increasingly exposed to threats that cannot be addressed effectively at a national level alone."
"Therefore, let us welcome favourably the Commission's proposal for a radical reform of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) and the extension of its mandate for another 18 months, which will allow us to overcome the risk of a dangerous legal vacuum."
"There is no doubt that the proliferation of security requirements involve costs for companies that are active within the EU, resulting in extensive fragmentation and lack of competitiveness in the internal European market."
"On the other hand, while the dependence on networks and information systems increases, the ability to respond to problems still seems inadequate."
"ENISA needs, therefore, to carry forward its commitments by adopting strategies designed to identify risks and vulnerabilities related to network and information security, enabling us to identify and deal with the challenges that we will have to face in the near future."
"The extension of the mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) by 18 months, as proposed by the Commission, makes perfect sense, as it allows the necessary discussions to be carried out within the European institutions, involving all stakeholders, including the public, about the challenges, priorities and responsibilities of the Agency, and thus avoiding the legal vacuum that would be caused if the mandate were not extended."
"The security of information networks is a priority for all those who use them."
"In terms of security, we have to maintain the same attention that was given to communications in the past; these have more advanced technology, so they require extra care."
"in writing. - (DE) The European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) was founded back in 2004."
"Its job is to ensure network and information security within the EU."
"It is also tasked with developing a culture of network and information security among citizens, consumers, businesses and public organisations in the European Union."
"In the context of exercises, as recently carried out against cyber crime, it must be possible to guarantee security in the event an emergency situation."
"However, the extent to which this is actually feasible in practice is not absolutely clear in my view."
"I did not vote in favour of the report, as there is a danger that additional costs will be incurred by citizens without there being any tangible benefits."
"in writing. - (DE) Despite financial crises, the EU has indulged, and continues to do so, in the creation of additional authorities - for every issue and every problem a new agency is set up."
"Between 2005 and 2009, the budget for the EU agencies more than doubled and the number of employees rose by 65%."
"The added value they provide is highly questionable, however."
"The results leave something to be desired and the monitoring of them is inadequate."
"On average, taxpayers have to pay EUR 579 million per year for the EU agencies."
"I am very much against the establishment of new agencies."
"It is unacceptable for taxpayers to finance the officials of the Member States with very cushy jobs in pointless agencies."
"I therefore voted against the report on establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency."
"The Commission has more than enough trained officials to take on this task."
"Europe needs a system that protects computer and information networks; this protection is guaranteed by ENISA, the European Agency for Network and Information Security."
"Mr Chichester's report is nothing other than a compromise between European institutions, which aims to extend its mandate and increase staff, with greater resources, and to give more importance to the fight against cybercrime so as to ensure better protection of information systems."
"It is precisely because I think it is important to ensure safety in this area, since we are in the digital age, that I have voted in favour of the regulation."
"I agree with this amendment to the mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA)."
"The Agency's legislative reform process, which is underway, still needs to be discussed at length, so the Agency's mandate, which expires on 13 March 2010, needs to be extended."
"In fact, it is necessary to approve an extension that gives enough time for Parliament and the Council to hold a discussion, so that the Agency's work maintains its consistency and continuity."
"In view of this, I voted in favour of this amendment, which states that the Agency's mandate should be extended until 13 September 2013."
"The strengthening of networks and information is a matter of great importance."
"It is therefore vital to ensure that there is enough time for the discussions that form part of the legislative reform process of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) to be carried out thoroughly, so I voted in favour of the extension of the Agency's mandate until 13 September 2013."
"in writing. - Following the Ordinary legislative procedure: (first reading)"
"The European Parliament,"
"having regard to the Commission proposal to Parliament and the Council,"
"having regard to Article 294(2) and Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, pursuant to which the Commission submitted the proposal to Parliament (C7-0297/2010),"
"having regard to Article 294(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,"
"having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee of 8 December 2010(1),"
"having regard to Rule 55 of its Rules of Procedure,"
"having regard to the report of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy,"
"1. Adopts its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal;"
"2. Calls on the Commission to refer the matter to Parliament again if it intends to amend its proposal substantially or replace it with another text;"
"3. Instructs its President to forward its position to the Council, the Commission and the national parliaments."
"The increasing amount of private information circulating in computer networks around the world daily constitutes a potential threat if it is violated."
"For this reason, I believe that the text adopted today would help increase the protection of sensitive information, which we need."
"ENISA, the European Agency responsible for information security, must be given a stronger role in fighting cybercrime, which must go hand in hand with a simplification of administrative procedures."
"I conclude by reiterating that this is also the position in my country, which wishes to strengthen the resources allocated to the Agency."
"in writing. - (DE) In 2004, the European Network and Information Security Agency was set up for a period of five years."
"Its 57 members of staff are concerned with the development of network and information security for citizens, consumers and businesses, and also for public organisations in the European Union."
"Its tasks included both risk analyses and preventative measures."
"On account of the continual and constantly faster pace of development of information and communications technologies and their fundamental importance for society and industry, it has been found that there is a need for this agency in future, too."
"However, for some time I have been calling for a business-based review of the EU agencies."
"There are already initiatives in place for the review of the system as a whole and I will not vote in favour of extending this agency until a review of this kind has been completed."
"On 11 March, Japan was struck by one of the most terrible earthquakes it has ever experienced, causing thousands of deaths and disappearances, significant material damage and a nuclear accident of extreme seriousness, affecting the Fukushima power station, which in its turn represents a new threat."
"The European Union must therefore take steps to supply all the humanitarian, technical and financial aid and support necessary to Japan and the affected regions."
"That is why I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this motion for a resolution."
"Japan has been struck by a natural disaster on a massive scale which also caused a major nuclear accident, the true scale of which has so far been impossible to assess and which will have consequences for people's health and the environment for decades to come."
"The European Union immediately activated its Civil Protection Mechanism to coordinate its humanitarian, technical and financial aid."
"This disaster should be seen as a starting point for thoroughly assessing and reconsidering issues surrounding the safety of nuclear energy."
"With nuclear energy there is not only the issue of the operation of power plants themselves, there is also the question of the storage of waste nuclear fuel that will last for centuries."
"During the earthquake in Japan, underground facilities for storing waste nuclear fuel were damaged, which would lead us to believe that the hitherto prevalent view that burial is the safest means of neutralising waste is not at all proven, and that waste storage facilities may become a great danger to people's health and the environment."
"I believe that it is essential to begin active discussions within the EU and at international level to make it possible to ensure the highest standard of waste storage in nuclear power plants already in operation and to seriously consider the benefits of the planned nuclear power plants and assess possible dangers."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because it expresses the solidarity of the people of Europe with Japan."
"Parliament is highlighting the courage of the Japanese in this crisis, the most serious since the Second World War, which has so severely affected their country."
"Among Japan's friends, Europeans have immediately reported themselves for duty to lend a helping hand to the people afflicted."
"However, the archipelago is faced with a nuclear problem that is of extreme concern and requires our full attention."
"It suits Europe to provide all its assistance and expertise to the Japanese authorities in order to prevent a catastrophe of the devastating consequences of which we are unfortunately all too well aware."
"As a Basque, I would like to express my sympathy for the people of Japan; to say to them that their attitude in the face of disaster, the way they deal with the present and the dignity with which they look to the future are all proof of their greatness."
"I should like to express my condolences to the families of all those who have died or disappeared."
"Europe must also continue to lend them all the human and material aid that is needed after they disappear from the news headlines, so that they may once again become what they always were: a great country and a great people."
"in writing. - (BG) I voted for the motion for a resolution on Japan as I think that it is our duty to show our solidarity with a people which has been hit with a triple misfortune and lost many of its citizens."
"Unfortunately, the outcome of this tragedy is still unknown."
"On the other hand, the disaster in Japan, especially the incident at Fukushima and the emergency situation following it, has brought back to the agenda the issue about the need for nuclear energy and its consequences."
"At the same time, I strongly believe that we should not overdramatise what has happened and abandon nuclear energy in the heat of the emotion."
"In my view, Europe needs nuclear energy, and a pragmatic approach must be adopted to the issue rather than us rashly deciding to shut down power stations."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, because I would firstly like to express my condolences and solidarity with the Japanese people following the natural disaster that claimed many lives and the catastrophe at Fukushima nuclear power plant."
"Devastated, Japan and its regions need all types of aid and support - humanitarian, financial and technical."
"I welcome the fact that the European Union immediately activated its Civil Protection Mechanism to coordinate its emergency aid."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that the disaster at Fukushima nuclear power plant is forcing us to consider the situation and future as regards European nuclear energy."
"In the European Parliament we should also discuss and assess the risk posed by nuclear power plants near the European Union's external borders."
"All European Union Member States should reflect and take action as regards nuclear power plants in their own countries, because of the possible threat radiation poses to the whole of Europe."
"Immediately following the events in Japan, for instance, Germany shut down its nuclear reactors built before 1980 and, taking into account specialists' research and expertise, is negotiating new alternatives to nuclear energy."
"I would like to express my solidarity with the Japanese people following the earthquake and the tsunami that occurred in March in northeast Japan."
"Serious flaws in the operation of nuclear power plants are raising fears of a nuclear disaster and forcing us to rethink nuclear safety standards in Europe."
"I would like to call for a serious discussion about the need for safe nuclear energy in Europe and about the fact that Europe needs this source of energy."
"Japan is overwhelmed today."
"One nuclear accident after another is coming on top of a natural disaster."
"This crisis is the most serious crisis that Japan has experienced since the Second World War."
"The victims number tens of thousands, and the material damage is considerable and still difficult to quantify."
"The European Union must deliver a response equal to the seriousness of the crisis."
"Japan has urgent need of aid."
"We urge the Commission to drive and coordinate the European solidarity effort."
"Europe's action must be clear, rapid and efficient in the short and long term."
"As regards the Fukushima power station, European unease is legitimate."
"The European executive must respond to this by asking for a series of crash tests to be carried out in an independent and transparent way on all of Europe's nuclear infrastructure."
"Finally, we cannot pass by without a collective reflection on our energy policy."
"On energy saving, renewable energy sources, the energy efficiency criterion, we expect ambitious and conclusive decisions from Europe, as we do on European research, often well below 3% of GDP."
"I voted for this motion for a resolution as I think that the European Parliament and European Union as a whole must show their solidarity in response to the tragic events which have occurred in Japan."
"The EU and its Member States must respond promptly in giving the humanitarian aid needed to help the Japanese population overcome the impact of the earthquake."
"I also believe that it is paramount that the particularly serious nuclear accident caused by this natural disaster is investigated properly so as to avoid the possibility of such incidents occurring in the future."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, which shows solidarity with the victims of the earthquake, the tsunami and the nuclear accident that have devastated Japan, and which calls upon the EU and its Member States to extend all possible aid and support needed at a humanitarian, technical and financial level to the regions affected, as a matter of urgency."
"On 11 March, Japan was hit by a massive earthquake, followed by a tsunami that has caused the greatest nuclear crisis in the country's history, with the Fukushima nuclear plant suffering serious structural damage, and since then having been in imminent danger of triggering a nuclear disaster of major proportions."
"This disaster has caused thousands of deaths and is the greatest tragedy to take place in Japan since World War II."
"At this time I would like to join with this House in passing a vote of complete solidarity with the Japanese people, and I would like to express my condolences to the families of the victims and all those who were affected by this disaster of unimaginable proportions."
"in writing. - (PT) The recent unprecedented natural disaster in Japan has left the international community deeply saddened, and has moved the European institutions not only to an expression of solidarity, but also offers of technical and humanitarian aid."
"The problems that have occurred at the Fukushima nuclear plant have put the discussion of energy issues at the top of the agenda once again."
"Indeed, 30% of the energy consumed by the EU is of nuclear origin; there are countries where domestic production is at 80%, such as France, and countries without any nuclear plants, such as Portugal and Austria."
"Parliament has discussed this issue on several occasions and has concluded that there is a need, despite environmental issues, for the EU and its Member States to encourage and support the generation of so-called 'green energy'."
"I therefore wholeheartedly support this resolution, which seeks, firstly, to develop a plan for verifying the security of all European nuclear power plants, and, on the other, to significantly increase energy production from renewable sources so that it becomes the main source of energy in the EU."
"We should also stress the need for energy efficiency and the fulfilment of the EU 2020 objectives."
"The motion for a resolution is focused on what we believe to be essential at this time: expressing complete solidarity with the Japanese people, especially the victims of the disaster that has struck the country, and their families."
"The EU should express this solidarity in a concrete way by making available forms of aid which are deemed necessary in the appropriate areas, to be defined and implemented in conjunction with the Japanese authorities."
"We therefore supported the resolution and voted in favour."
"Alongside this resolution there are issues relating to nuclear safety, and the lessons to be learnt from what has happened at the Fukushima plant, a subject which we were able to address during the debate."
"In particular, there is a need to review and, if necessary, adjust redundancies in the security systems in the existing plants in EU Member States."
"There is also a need to undertake a broad discussion as a society about the energy issue, our present and future needs, and how these can be met."
"This should be done in a lucid way, with information about the impact, potential and limitations of each of the different types of energy."
"We voted in favour of solidarity with the Japanese Government following its threefold disaster - the earthquake, the tsunami and the nuclear accident - which has struck the country."
"In a joint resolution submitted by all of the political groups, Parliament asks the EU and its Member States to extend all possible aid and support needed at a humanitarian, technical and financial level to Japan."
"The devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on 11 March caused thousands of deaths and missing persons, along with considerable material damage."
"The disaster also caused an extremely serious nuclear accident which is affecting the Fukushima nuclear plant and constitutes a new threat."
"We would therefore like to express our complete solidarity with the victims of this threefold disaster, at a time when the level of human losses and material damage has not yet been fully assessed."
"By the same token, we would like to highlight the 'mobilisation, courage and determination' of the Japanese people in the face of this disaster, and call upon the EU and its Member States to extend all possible aid and support needed at a humanitarian, technical and financial level to Japan and the regions affected, as a priority."
"The composure and decorum of the population of Japan is the only consolation in the apocalyptic vision and the media have shown this to the whole world."
"An endless tragedy in which man's limitations are made most apparent and surprisingly relevant when confronted with the relentless force of nature."
"Global solidarity and concrete assistance, generously provided, are the right and dutiful response of the international community."
"Each of us will remember the heroic example of those volunteers - mostly retired firemen - who offered their lives to help put out the fires in the reactors at Fukushima."
"It represents an example for Japan and for us all, while underlining the need for Europe to adopt a strategy for natural and man-made disasters."
"As explained, I support the resolution on Japan with conviction."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, because the devastating earthquake and the tsunami which struck Japan and the Pacific region on 11 March this year resulted in the death or disappearance of thousands of people and caused considerable material damage."
"The disaster also caused an extremely serious nuclear accident, which is affecting Fukushima nuclear power plant and constitutes a fresh threat."
"The Prime Minister of Japan, Naoto Kan, has stated that the country is facing its most serious crisis in 65 years, since the Second World War."
"At the same time I would like to offer the Japanese people my sympathy and support following this natural disaster and catastrophe which claimed many lives."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament also expresses its most complete solidarity with the Japanese people and government and presents its sincere condolences to the victims of this threefold disaster, bearing in mind that the human losses and material damage have not yet been fully assessed."
"It also welcomes the mobilisation, courage and determination of the Japanese people and of the authorities in response to this disaster, and calls on the Union and its Member States, as a priority, to give Japan and the disaster regions all necessary humanitarian, technical and financial aid and support."
"It is good that the Union immediately activated its Civil Protection Mechanism to coordinate its emergency aid."
"However, it is becoming clear that the disaster in Japan is forcing us to fundamentally reconsider the issue of nuclear security, and we must strengthen nuclear safety throughout the entire European Union."
"Today's motion for a resolution to give support to Japan has been voted in unanimously by all political groups in Parliament in order to express our closeness to Japan, the protagonist of the tragic events of 11 March 2011."
"I supported the resolution because, despite the economic and financial downturn and the instability in North African countries, European institutions should not and cannot fail to support Japan both economically and in terms of humanitarian aid."
"What occurred has produced and will continue to produce inevitable economic and financial difficulties, creating unavoidable repercussions in the European and world markets."
"The meeting between the EU and Japan, scheduled for May here in Brussels, can represent the beginning of the collaboration and support which the EU must guarantee in setting itself up as a key partner for reconstruction, helping Japan whether it be with technical assistance in the energy sector or strengthening business relationships aimed at quickly rebuilding this great world power."
"Moreover, I consider it fitting that the European Ministers of Energy have decided to give priority to safety in European nuclear plants, emphasising the importance of greater European coordination during the modernisation of nuclear facilities."
"For two weeks now, one of the most serious nuclear accidents in history has been played out in Japan."
"It is still too early to gauge the full extent of the disaster, but it is evident that, apart from Chernobyl, no place on Earth has yet been stricken by civil nuclear technology."
"The situation at Fukushima arouses dread and compassion in all of us, and asks questions of our own system for producing nuclear energy."
"For all that, I find it particularly scandalous that legitimate concerns aroused by this period of crisis should be exploited for partisan ends."
"It is not a question of banning the debate on nuclear power."
"As with any issue, and particularly for those of such strategic importance, democratic debate must enable wise solutions to be adopted."
"Since I do not believe that emotion is a good counsellor, I supported the emergency resolution of the European Parliament."
"It sends a message of firm support to our Japanese friends without permitting the intrusion of domestic concerns that would not respect the period of decency that is both necessary and indispensable."
"We should pay the utmost attention and respond urgently to the situation in Japan in the aftermath of the terrible disaster, and provide not only moral, but also economic, humanitarian and political support."
"We should acknowledge the way in which the Japanese people have conducted themselves and the actions of the rescue and prevention services."
"Other parts of the world, including Europe, should learn lessons from this disaster."
"We have areas of seismic activity."
"Lisbon suffered a great deal of damage as a result of a tsunami centuries ago, as did Messina at a later date and Skopje due to an earthquake 50 years ago."
"We have been working for years on an early-warning system, and yet we still do not have anything substantial to show for it."
"We should accelerate work dramatically on this project."
"Early warnings may prevent unnecessary deaths, and even many thousands of such deaths."
"in writing. - One of course has to agree with the joint resolution tabled on behalf of the political groups on the triple tragedies in Japan of earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident and join in expressing Europe's condolences for those who lost their lives in these awful events."
"However, Japan's appreciation of our sincerity behind this resolution will, I am sure, be tempered - when it is adopted almost unanimously tomorrow - by the actions of Member States that have either at best overreacted and threatened public panic or at worst used the opportunity to impose protectionist measures."
"The Spanish Government has urged that goods from Japan should be checked carefully for radiation, the Netherlands has cautioned dock workers to handle all containers from Japan with care, France is demanding a check on all goods before being exported from Japan and German customs is demanding random checks for radiation on all goods, including cars, imported from Japan."
"Most of these restrictions have been imposed on goods that had been produced and left Japanese ports weeks if not months before the earthquake!"
"So much for solidarity!"
"in writing. - (IT) The disaster which has hit Japan owing to an earthquake and a tsunami of surprising proportions has left us all with a sense of profound sorrow at the immense loss of life and substantial damage to property."
"Let us then, as MEPs, express all our sincere sympathy to the people and government of Japan."
"Our thoughts and those of all European citizens go out to the thousands of people who will now have to rebuild their lives and their communities."
"At the same time, we are impressed by the rapid and decisive action of local authorities and emergency services and by the exemplary courage and determination of the Japanese people."
"Although the EU has already activated its Civil Protection Mechanism by sending experts from Europe to coordinate emergency aid, we also urge Member States, as a priority, to support disaster areas with all the humanitarian, technical and financial help and support they need."
"Recalling the strong friendship and close political and economic relations that bind the EU to Japan, we are determined to support this country struggling to overcome the challenges it faces, including the threat of a real nuclear catastrophe."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution expressing the solidarity of members of the European Parliament with the Japanese people and their government after the striking events of recent days."
"We wish to see the Union and the Member States supply all the humanitarian, technical and financial aid and support necessary to Japan and the affected regions."
"It is the duty of Parliament to express its solidarity with the Japanese government following its threefold disaster - the earthquake, the tsunami and the nuclear accident - which has struck the country."
"In this joint resolution submitted by all of the political groups, we call upon the EU and its Member States to extend all possible aid and support needed at a humanitarian, technical and financial level to Japan."
"The devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on 11 March caused thousands of deaths and missing persons, along with considerable material damage."
"The disaster also caused an extremely serious nuclear accident which is affecting the Fukushima nuclear plant and itself constitutes a serious threat."
"It is also our duty to express our complete solidarity with the Japanese people and their government, and to send our condolences to the victims of this threefold disaster."
"Faced with the extent of the tsunami and the magnitude of the earthquake on 11 March, I must express my complete solidarity with the victims' families and the people and government of Japan."
"I should also like to express my full support and my complete admiration to the rescuers and the staff of the Fukushima power station."
"Fortunately, the European Union was in a position to respond rapidly to the Japanese request, in particular by deploying its 'Civil Protection Mechanism', which is designed to coordinate the actions of the 27 Member States in emergencies at the national, European and international level."
"By the same token, the Union is ready to provide all its technical expertise in the nuclear arena in order to help Japanese and international experts to take control of the situation in the proximity and in the very heart of the Fukushima power plant."
"in writing. - (DE) The devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan and the Pacific region on 11 March 2011 resulted in the deaths or disappearance of thousands of people as well as considerable material damage, destroying the livelihoods of many people."
"This subsequently led to an extremely serious nuclear accident in the Fukushima nuclear power station."
"According to the statement given by the Japanese Prime Minister, Naoto Kan, the country is facing its most serious crisis in 65 years, since the Second World War."
"In this motion for a resolution, the European Parliament expresses its solidarity with the Japanese people and presents its sincere condolences to the victims of the disaster."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution and very much hope that the situation in Japan can be brought under control and that there will be a global rethink with regard to nuclear energy."
"in writing. - (LT) We have watched Japan suffer a series of horrific disasters, the likes of which no other country has ever experienced together."
"An earthquake, a tsunami, an accident in a nuclear power plant - any one of these catastrophes would be a major challenge on their own, but together they have placed an unbearable burden on the shoulders of the country and its citizens."
"Once the fire that continues to smoulder at Fukushima nuclear power plant has gone out, many questions will need to be answered - could certain disasters have been avoided, and what safety improvements should other nuclear power plants carry out, so that natural disasters do not cause nuclear accidents?"
"All countries using nuclear power should check the safety of their nuclear power plants."
"Those planning to construct new power stations should examine more closely the dangers they pose."
"However, at present it is most important for the European Union to show solidarity with the ordinary people of Japan."
"The resolution on the situation in Japan is therefore crucial."
"We must provide all the necessary humanitarian, technical and financial support to help people survive now and to reconstruct affected regions in the future as soon as possible."
"The disastrous earthquake that struck Japan on 11 March cannot pass unnoticed in the eyes of the world; it must be our cue to reflect on the political and socio-economic aspects of the disastrous consequences of the tsunami."
"Like all my colleagues, in approving this motion for a resolution I express my deepest sympathy to the Japanese people who, with a great sense of civil responsibility, are reacting as best they can to the disaster."
"I hope and request that the EU will take action to provide humanitarian aid, through its own civil protection services, and propose suitable projects to solve the problem of nuclear contamination through a joint project with the Japanese authorities to try, as far as possible, to restore the situation to normal."
"On 11 March, Japan and the Pacific region were hit by a devastating earthquake, followed by a tsunami which caused thousands of deaths and missing persons, along with considerable material damage."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, which expresses solidarity with the victims of the earthquake, the tsunami and the nuclear accident, and I hope that Parliament's call for the EU and its Member States to extend all possible aid and support needed at a humanitarian, technical and financial level to the regions affected, will be heeded with the utmost urgency."
"At a time when Japan is facing its worst crisis since World War II, following the earthquake and tsunami that devastated the country on 11 March, I would like to join the expression of complete solidarity with the Japanese people and Parliament's call for the EU and its Member States to extend to the affected regions all the help and aid needed at a humanitarian, technical and financial level, as a matter of urgency."
"The earthquake and the tsunami that struck Japan on 11 March have led to the deaths of many thousands of people (the current count exceeds 27 000 dead and missing), and have caused considerable material damage."
"Under these conditions, Japan must now deal with a nuclear accident of extreme seriousness."
"As Japan has not experienced such a crisis since the Second World War, I fully support the resolution of the European Parliament on the situation in that country."
"I also call upon the EU to provide Japan with all the humanitarian, technical and financial assistance possible, including medical supplies, mattresses, tents, food, experts and specialists in radioactivity and nuclear energy ..."
"I also wish to put on record my fullest solidarity with the Japanese people."
"I congratulate them on their mobilisation, their courage and their determination in the face of such a disaster."
"Moreover, given the gravity of the situation in the Fukushima power station, I call on the Japanese Government to demonstrate the fullest transparency and on the Member States of the EU to organise a broad public debate on energy, one that is not solely restricted to nuclear."
"in writing. - I very much support this resolution that states: '1."
"Expresses its most complete solidarity with the Japanese people and government and presents its sincere condolences to the victims of this threefold disaster, bearing in mind that the human losses and material damage have not yet been fully assessed; welcomes the mobilisation, courage and determination of the Japanese people and of the authorities in response to this disaster; 2."
"Calls on the Union and its Member States, as a priority, to give Japan and the disaster regions all necessary humanitarian, technical and financial aid and support and welcomes the fact that the Union immediately activated its Civil Protection Mechanism to coordinate its emergency aid;'."
"With today's vote I wanted to express solidarity with the Japanese people and its government in the wake of the devastating earthquake, the tsunami and the nuclear accident."
"Together with my colleagues, we have invited Member States to provide Japan and the affected regions with all necessary support, including humanitarian, technical and financial support, while praising the decision to activate the Civil Protection Mechanism immediately to coordinate emergency aid."
"The exemplary courage and determination shown by the Japanese people and authorities in addressing the situation should be an example for all, and one more reason for the EU not to abandon this country in the very delicate phase of its complete reconstruction."
"in writing. - I welcome this resolution as I think we need to support those in Japan and also to learn from this terrible situation."
"On 11 March the Pacific region, and Japan in particular, was rocked by a devastating earthquake and tsunami."
"I believe that it is important to mention once again here that natural disasters are increasing in number and intensity, and it is therefore necessary to rethink pre- and post-crisis scenarios at a global level in order to anticipate and provide assistance to the countries affected."
"At the same time, the natural disaster also caused an extremely serious nuclear accident, which has affected the Fukushima nuclear plant in particular."
"This event has shown that it is crucial to think about safety conditions at European nuclear plants."
"I would therefore like to call for a discussion, preceded by a thorough analysis, on how to reduce the devastating effects of a nuclear accident on the regions and people where it occurs."
"I welcome the EU's willingness to extend all humanitarian, technical and financial aid as a priority, along with the instant activation of the European civil protection mechanism."
"However, I believe that it is vital to grant this mechanism more logistic and planning resources so that it can become a real mechanism for the protection of the countries affected."
"My thoughts go out to the victims' families, to the wounded and to all the Japanese people who have been struck by this cataclysm."
"The courage and dignity of the Japanese people compels admiration and I am pleased that this House has demonstrated its support and its solidarity by means of this resolution."
"This is the greatest disaster that Japan has experienced since the Second World War, and the catastrophe at Fukushima has shocked us all and forces us to review our approach to nuclear energy."
"This issue has no bearing, however, despite what some may have us believe by means of a political salvage operation, on the opportunity to continue with the production of nuclear energy, an energy of the future that plays its part in the decarbonisation of our economy and that guarantees our energy independence."
"The drama of Fukushima requires us above all to strengthen our requirements in the area of nuclear safety."
"I support the proposals of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for a definition of common safety standards and for greater vigilance within and around nuclear power stations."
"In this matter, the expertise and performance of the French nuclear industry must serve as an example."
"From now on, the responsibility rests with the European Union, which must take strong measures to ensure that a nuclear disaster of this magnitude will never happen in Europe."
"in writing. - (SK) The enormous damage caused by the recent earthquakes and tsunami in Japan will not be cleared up overnight."
"We must stand ready to provide Japan with concrete practical assistance, even after the media interest has died away."
"Solidarity is one of the fundamental pillars on which today's Europe rests."
"It is right that, along with Member State governments and parliaments, the European Parliament too has given a clear signal to our friends in Japan, sorely afflicted as the country is, that we are with them and that they can rely on our help at any time."

"Statements by the President"
"I would like to start by making some comments and passing on some information."
"On 26 April, 25 years will have passed since the Chernobyl disaster, which was the most serious nuclear accident in the history of humanity."
"We still remember those who sacrificed their health or even their lives while battling the disaster, and also the hundreds of thousands of people who had to leave their homes."
"The then authorities of the former Eastern Bloc countries spent too long concealing information about the disaster from the world and, above all, from their own citizens."
"This made it much more difficult to take any measures to mitigate the effects of the disaster."
"Later, however, Chernobyl became a symbol of effective cooperation between the authorities of the countries affected by the disaster and the international community."
"While we remember the Chernobyl disaster today, our thoughts are also with the Japanese nation, which is struggling with the aftermath of the tsunami and the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant."
"Next comes a second piece of information, which is also a painful reminder."
"In several days' time, on 10 April, a year will have passed since the Smolensk air disaster."
"Ninety-six people died in the disaster, including the Polish President and his wife and 18 members of the Polish Parliament."
"One of the members was ready to take a seat in the European Parliament, as one of 18 extra MEPs."
"The majority of those who died held high-ranking positions within the state."
"They were known personally to many present in this Chamber."
"I myself knew at least half of them."
"The reasons for the disaster are not yet entirely clear, and we are still waiting for information in this respect."
"At this time, we once again join those still mourning their loved ones."
"The third piece of information relates to the fact that the European Parliament is alarmed at the US Supreme Court's rejection of Troy Davis' request that his execution be delayed, and that it be made possible for his case to be reopened."
"I would appeal to the relevant American authorities of the state of Georgia to make use of their right to commute the death penalty imposed on Mr Davis 20 years ago to a punishment of life imprisonment."
"Death can never be an expression of justice."
"The next piece of information relates to the fact that we are also deeply concerned by events in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire."
"The presidential elections brought terror and violence to the country, instead of the peace, future and prosperity awaited by its citizens."
"Laurent Gbagbo must recognise the results of the elections and hand over power."
"We call on both sides to put an immediate stop to the use of violence against civilians."
"The international community must do everything in its power to stop the massacre of the population."
"All those guilty of crimes will be brought to justice."
"This is our deep conviction, and the European Parliament will do everything possible in this regard."
"The final piece of information concerns the fact that, in line with my promise to keep Parliament up-to-date with the progress of investigations into the allegations of corruption against certain Members of the European Parliament, I would like to remind you that on Thursday, after a meeting of the presidents of the political groups, you received a letter from me with the latest information on this matter."
"We are also taking firm action with a view to drawing up a code of conduct for interest groups and lobbyists, as well as for Members of the European Parliament."
"During today's meeting of the Bureau at 18:30, we will discuss this matter and decide on the next steps to be taken in this regard."
"Mr Nicholson has asked to speak."
"Please take the floor, Mr Nicholson."
"Mr President, could I take this moment to reflect on the murder in Northern Ireland on Saturday of a young police constable on his way to work, just a few weeks qualified to do the job."
"In my 22 years in this House, I have had many occasions where I have had to condemn the terrorists who carry out such atrocities."
"I thought that time had passed and I would never have to do so again."
"Our thoughts are with the family of the young man, who had a career and a great future in front of him."
"It was a clear and deliberate attempt to once again destabilise my region."
"I want to make it clear that I believe that the vast majority of the people of Northern Ireland do not wish to return now, or any time in the future, to what we went through in the past."
"The people of Omagh suffered a lot."
"For this to happen to them as well, I have no doubt, brings back many terrible memories."
"Can we send our sympathy to the family and everyone involved, on this very sad occasion for my region?"
"(Applause)"
"Thank you for your comments on this matter."
"I would like to inform Members that yesterday morning, I issued a special statement concerning this matter - a statement by the President of the European Parliament, in which I condemned this event, and, in particular, the fact that the victim was so young."
"I also expressed the hope that Northern Ireland will live in peace, as it has recently succeeded in doing."
"Members can read my statement from yesterday morning on this matter on the European Parliament's website."
"(GA) Mr President, I also condemn the killing of Ronan Kerr in a bomb attack in Omagh, in my constituency, at the weekend."
"He was a young 25 year-old man who joined the new police service and was killed because of it."
"It is not just an attack on this young man and his family but on the peace process in my constituency as well."
"The people who killed Ronan Kerr are trying to block the progress of the peace process and we will not allow them to do so."
"May I thank the President of Parliament today for expressing his condolences and those of Parliament to the family."
"In addition, I sympathise with Ronan Kerr's family and strongly condemn his killing."
"Mr President, first of all, I want to thank you for issuing the statement of condemnation yesterday."
"I want to support the statements of Members Nicholson and de Brún here today."
"They have our full support to ensure that those responsible will be brought to justice."
"The peace process, with the support of the European Union, has been very successful."
"All sane people on the island of Ireland have condemned this atrocious act - the murder of Constable Ronan Kerr - ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam."
"I want, in particular, to compliment his mother for the courageous statement she made last night in support of the continuation of the peace process."
"Composition of Parliament"
"Ernst Strasser has submitted his resignation as a Member of the European Parliament with effect from 24 March 2011."
"Pursuant to Rule 4(1) and (3) of the Rules of Procedure, Parliament has noted his resignation and established the vacancy of his seat from the date previously stated."
"Hella Ranner has submitted her resignation as a Member of the European Parliament with effect from 1 April 2011."
"Pursuant to Rule 4(1) and (3) of the Rules of Procedure, Parliament has noted her resignation and established the vacancy of her seat from the date previously stated."
"The competent Austrian authorities have informed me that Ernst Strasser will be replaced by Hubert Pirker with effect from 31 March 2011."
"I would like to welcome our new Member and to remind Members that pursuant to Rule 3(2) of the Rules of Procedure, until his credentials have been verified or a ruling has been given on any dispute, Hubert Pirker will take his seat in Parliament and on its bodies and enjoy all the rights pertaining thereto, provided that he has previously signed a written declaration that he does not hold any office incompatible with that of Member of the European Parliament."
"(NL) Mr President, I wish to raise a point of order in connection with Mr Strasser and the other Member who have left Parliament because of corrupt behaviour: I would like to ask whether you, Mr President, are going to check whether it is possible to stop their reduced pay, because it would be outrageous if anyone who has been involved in corruption here left with reduced pay."
"Would you please look into this?"
"We will answer that question later, as I was not prepared for it."
"(ES) Mr President, on a point of order: you earlier referred to a request, on behalf of the whole House, that a state of the United States imprison someone for life rather than executing them."
"I should like to request that, while we do indeed request that this sentence be commuted, we do not say 'to the sentence of life imprisonment', particularly given what life imprisonment means in the United States."
"I think it should be phrased as the death penalty being commuted 'to another proportionate sentence'."
"Thank you."
"This certainly calls for a separate and far-reaching debate."
"Finding a solution to this problem is definitely not a simple matter."
"My next announcement is that the competent Austrian bodies have informed me that Hella Ranner will be replaced by Heinz Becker with effect from 1 April 2011."
"I would like to welcome our new Member and to remind Members that pursuant to Rule 3(2) of the Rules of Procedure, until his credentials have been verified or a ruling has been given on any dispute, Heinz Becker will take his seat in Parliament and on its bodies and enjoy all the rights pertaining thereto, provided that he has previously signed a written declaration that he does not hold any office incompatible with that of Member of the European Parliament."

"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"Tuesday"
"With regard to the Fernandes report on estimates of Parliament's revenue and expenditure for 2012, the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group has requested that the vote be held over to the May part-session, and thus the request relates to holding the vote over."
"Mrs Andreasen will present the request."
"Please take the floor, Mrs Andreasen."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, I rise to ask for the postponement of the vote on the Fernandes report."
"The reasons are straightforward and relate primarily to the paragraph of the report which covers the House of European History."
"The Committee on Budgets has been given conflicting, and I believe, misleading figures for this project."
"An example of this is the mounting annual running costs: they currently stand at EUR 13.5 million."
"This figure is in excess of what was originally quoted."
"When I had suggested that the cost would be EUR 10 million, a faceless parliamentary official accused me of lying in the press by saying my estimates were, I quote, 'excessive'."
"This is not the way a Member of this House should be treated."
"What is worst of all, Mr President, is the clear conflict of interests in having the chairman of the Budgets Committee sitting on the board of trustees of the House of European History, even if he is not remunerated."
"In no other parliament would such a clear conflict of interests be tolerated."
"It makes an absolute mockery of the committee process."
"(Applause)"
"Until these matters are cleared up, the vote on this report must be postponed."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think this postponement is appropriate."
"It is a case of four or five weeks, simply to examine a subject which, as we just heard, involves the disbursement of millions of euro by European taxpayers."
"I therefore call for a vote in support of the request."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to say two things."
"Firstly, the Committee on Budgets has done its job and brought the draft estimate of Parliament's 2012 budget to the point where it can be examined, debated and voted on by your Parliament, by the House, in accordance with our procedures and with what we did last year."
"Opinions differ among the groups."
"They will be able to have their say."
"Secondly, I cannot allow Mrs Andreasen, who is fully acquainted with this matter, to say that there is a personal conflict of interest in having me, the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, sit on the board of trustees of the House of European History."
"I do not sit on the board in a personal capacity; I am there in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on Budgets, appointed by the Committee on Budgets to represent it within that body, just as the Chair of the Committee on Culture and Education represents her committee within that body."
"Naturally, if someone were to dispute that, I would be prepared to give up the role."
"Still, one must be careful not to confuse matters when using words such as 'conflict of interest', Mr President."
"(Applause)"
"With regard to the debate on the Single Market, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has requested that it be possible to table motions for resolutions to wind up the debate on the Commission statement on public procurement."
"We are thus talking about a motion for a resolution, or a proposal for a resolution."
"I would like someone from the PPE Group to present this request."
"Who will be so kind?"
"(Parliament rejected the request)"
"Wednesday"
"Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) proposes that we supplement the statement by Commissioner Barnier on public procurement law and its continued development in the European Union with a statement by Parliament."
"That would give the matter considerably more substance and we therefore ask for support in this."
"(DE) Mr President, I support the proposal by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), as it makes perfect sense to discuss this."
"I would just ask - in agreement with the coordinator of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mr Schwab - that we do not vote on the resolution this week, but wait until May to do so, because we have not yet had time to discuss this among the groups."
"Thus, I would say 'yes' to the inclusion of this item on the agenda, 'yes' to a resolution, but I would like the vote on the resolution to wait until May."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested that a debate be held on the situation concerning Ai Weiwei in China, and that it be included in the debates held pursuant to Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure on Thursday afternoon, instead of the debate on Zimbabwe previously intended for this time."
"I would like to ask Mr Verhofstadt, President of the Group, to take the floor."
"(Parliament agreed to the request)"
"Thursday"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Mr Ai Weiwei, who is the best-known Chinese artist and dissident and has always had the opportunity to speak freely, was detained at Beijing Airport on Sunday and is, apparently, in prison."
"Not only should I use this opportunity to protest against the Chinese authorities."
"I also have to say to you and to our colleagues that we should perhaps reconsider our participation in the second China-EU summit next month in Beijing if this is the direction in which things are going."
"It is necessary for us to have an urgent resolution on this as fast as possible so that we can increase pressure on the Chinese authorities to release Mr Ai Weiwei."
"The first idea was to replace the urgent resolution on Zimbabwe on Thursday by an urgent resolution on the detention of Mr Ai Weiwei, but after brief consultation, it seems there may be a better option: putting Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) on Wednesday, so that the space that is liberated on Thursday could then be used for this urgent resolution on Mr Ai Weiwei."
"I have consulted the different political groups here and they agree with this way of changing the agenda."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like very briefly to speak in favour of this."
"Given that the agenda for Wednesday afternoon is so tight, I would ask that the Council and the Commission make their statements very, very brief and that the Vice-Presidents in the Chair make sure that speakers stick very precisely to their speaking time."
"Otherwise, we will have chaos."
"I ask for the support of the Vice-Presidents in this."
"We will have the discussion on Mr Ai Weiwei and China on Thursday afternoon, and the discussion on Ivory Coast will take place at about 8 p.m. on Wednesday evening."
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"Wednesday"
"There is another proposal from Mrs Gebhardt."
"Mrs Gebhardt, could you once again explain your proposal."
"(DE) Mr President, I asked that the vote on the resolution on public procurement be postponed until May, which, of course, means that the deadline for the submission of resolutions and amendments would then also be postponed accordingly."
"You have not given us a chance to vote on that yet."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the subject, the time allowed to submit the amendments seems sufficient, so I think that we should not accept the proposal."
"Mr President, I was not quite sure under which point I should raise this, but two weeks ago, the administration - following a number of cyber attacks - decided to close down the webmail for a week."
"It is quite some decision to prevent people from accessing their webmail for a week."
"Explanations are in order."
"I would like to know if this was justified, if it was just a precaution, and how vulnerable our system really is."
"Mrs in 't Veld, we will look into this and send you the information."
"Granting and withdrawing international protection (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Guillaume, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing international protection (recast) - C7-0248/2009 -."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first stage will be reached this week in the recasting of the Asylum Procedures Directive."
"Indeed, our Parliament will be required on Wednesday to give its verdict on the revised Commission proposal on common procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status."
"This European Parliament opinion is essential to the dialogue that will be pursued with the Council in the coming months on a text that I believe is the cornerstone of the asylum package and on which - I am sorry to say - discussions are at a standstill in the Council."
"It will serve as a basis for a new version of this directive, which I hope will enable us to stick to our 2012 deadline for implementing common asylum rules."
"The vote on this report coincides with the publication, last week, of a UNHCR study on the 44 industrialised nations."
"The study shows that, contrary to popular belief, the number of asylum seekers in rich countries has decreased overall by 40% in 10 years and by 5% in one year."
"Armed with such data, we need to study the root causes of this decline."
"Is it because of fewer push factors, or tighter migration control in some countries?"
"What that report also shows is that developing countries today assume the lion's share of the responsibility for asylum, even though they do not necessarily have all the resources to do so."
"Europe must therefore do its fair share, and for that it must adopt clear rules."
"This brings me back to this text on asylum procedures and to the main challenges."
"Often described as a catalogue of the worst national practices, the current directive has two major disadvantages: it fails to sufficiently protect the rights of asylum seekers, and it creates major disparities in treatment within the Member States."
"Indeed, major discrepancies still remain between the different asylum systems in Europe."
"To take just two examples, in 2009, the percentage of positive decisions at first instance in the Member States ranged from 65% to less than 1%."
"The time limit for lodging an appeal against a negative decision at first instance ranged from two to 30 days."
"There are a number of disparities, then, between the Member States, whether in terms of the grounds for accelerated procedures, or in terms of access to personal interviews or to effective remedy."
"The fact is, such disparities are incompatible with a common asylum system which ought to offer equivalent protection throughout the EU."
"They also run counter to one of the cornerstones of the Dublin II Regulation, which is based on the presumption that the Member States' asylum systems are comparable."
"Legislative harmonisation is therefore essential to ensuring that we have fair, accessible, safe and effective procedures at long last."
"Since I believe they are incorrect, I should like to respond once again to some assertions made by the detractors of this text, for whom this directive ultimately amounts to little more than an increase in costs and abuses."
"Admittedly, these procedural changes may create costs in the short term."
"However, a little clear-sightedness would help us see that it is, in fact, the misuse of inadequate procedures in quality and security terms that is today costing the Member States dear."
"I would mention two indicators to support my argument: the very large number of appeals and the length of the procedures thus generated."
"I should also like us to move away from the black and white idea of asylum, where it is said to lead only to abuse."
"In a context in which immigration issues are being exploited, to defend asylum as a fundamental right is an obligation."
"Moreover, if the most reticent MEPs take anything away from the situation in the Arab world, it will be that the European Union has a responsibility to grant fair protection to victims of persecution."
"I therefore support the Commission's approach, which aims to improve the procedures at first instance - 'front-loading' - because high quality decisions at first instance will be particularly beneficial for victims of persecution insofar as they will enable the competent authorities to deliver robust decisions, improve the defendability of negative decisions, and thus reduce the risk of them being overturned by appeal bodies, better identify cases of unfounded or abusive applications, and reduce reception and procedural costs in the Member States, while supporting their efforts to expel asylum seekers whose applications have genuinely been rejected."
"Lastly, I should like to say a few words about some key points that will enable us - I hope - to take this report further now."
"Firstly, the right to free legal assistance at first instance is, to my mind, an essential guarantee when it comes to improving the quality of decisions."
"Secondly, better account will be taken of vulnerable applicants, a group of people that the current directive completely overlooks."
"The third challenge is to establish more ambitious time limits for appeals so as to strengthen the right to effective remedy, and to provide greater guarantees in the case of accelerated procedures, in particular, a reduction in their grounds or the setting of reasonable time limits."
"As for the safe countries concept, we call for a common European list to be adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, as the Court of Justice recommended in 2008."
"To conclude, the final adoption of this report should be a strong signal from Parliament to the Council and the Commission."
"As I see it, Parliament's red lines have been established and the bar has been set: we are aiming at the upwards harmonisation of protection standards, and we should be delighted at that, ladies and gentlemen."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the vote on the Asylum Procedures Directive this week is very important."
"It will be a crucial step on the road towards the conclusion of the second phase of the common asylum system by 2012, in line with the EU's commitment to the Stockholm Programme."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Sylvie Guillaume, for her outstanding commitment to this file and for the good cooperation between us."
"You have shown great resilience, Madam, and a deep understanding of the needs of asylum seekers and of the challenges faced by national administrations."
"The new Asylum Procedures Directive will be the cornerstone of the Common European Asylum System."
"Asylum seekers must, as you said, Madam, be offered the same level of treatment wherever they apply for asylum in the European Union."
"Today, we know that there are lots of differences, which is, of course, very hard to understand in the same European Union with the same international conventions and the same European values."
"It is crucial that the common procedures are fair and efficient."
"They must help to prevent abuses of the asylum system, but fully respect fundamental rights."
"I deeply believe that these objectives can be achieved, but only if the common rules ensure the same high quality of decision by asylum authorities across the Union."
"The Commission proposal has been prepared in this spirit and I note with satisfaction that Mrs Guillaume and the report of the Committee on Civil Liberties generally support this proposal."
"Many amendments in the draft report in fact increase the level of guarantees to asylum seekers, particularly with regard to minors."
"Some amendments also aim to provide more flexibility for the Member States by introducing certain grounds for accelerated procedures."
"I find the amendment on safe country notions very ambitious."
"It would significantly restructure the set of rules and change practices in Member States."
"I also note with interest the compromise amendments on free legal assistance."
"This could indeed help to resolve a tricky legal issue that several Member States have mentioned."
"As you know, the Commission is currently preparing a modified proposal for this directive in order to give a boost to the stalled negotiations in the Council."
"The vote that you will take tomorrow or on Wednesday is a strategic benchmark in the negotiations."
"The Commission will carefully consider all Parliament's amendments in the preparation of the modified proposal."
"I look forward to working together with Members on this and on the other proposals."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks for the many talks we were able to have with the rapporteur and also with the Commissioner and shadow rapporteurs."
"This enabled good compromises to be reached in some areas."
"As Mrs Malmström just mentioned, this includes the compromise on free legal assistance, in particular, for the special protection of minors."
"Other achievements include the fact that we were able to agree on which applicants were particularly worthy of protection and, in our talks with one another, we were able to find a sensible compromise."
"Over and above that, we also found a compromise with regard to the subject of safe third countries."
"The aim is to fundamentally improve the quality of the administrative procedures so that there are fewer hearings in court in the second and third instance, in order to provide asylum seekers who are genuinely facing persecution with as rapid and as consistently effective assistance and protection as possible."
"I am strongly in favour of there being appropriate minimum standards in all Member States."
"Unfortunately, however, both the Commission's text and some of the individual amendments intended to amend the Commission's text to a certain extent do the opposite of what this good intention is striving to achieve."
"Many opportunities have been created to delay procedures or even to massively abuse asylum law."
"I will give you a few examples of this."
"For example, an applicant can make three inadmissible applications and has the right to go through the full procedure three times."
"Only then can an accelerated procedure be carried out."
"A procedure cannot be accelerated if someone is clearly not recognised as a refugee under the Geneva Convention."
"In this regard, I would simply mention the subject of Tunisia and also that of economic migrants."
"Another example is the fact that an accelerated procedure will also not be possible if subsequent applications are made without any relevant new content."
"What I consider to be even more serious, however, is the subject of disappearing."
"If someone illegally disappears, his application can no longer be closed with a negative decision."
"He has to countersign the letter."
"Therefore, if an asylum seeker were expecting news of a negative decision, all he would need to do - if we were to adopt the motion put forward by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - would be to refuse to accept the letter or not be there to receive it."
"The consequence of that would be that he could prolong the procedure indefinitely."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I speak on behalf of my group when I say that we are in a very difficult situation practically and politically, in which Member States have been talking about completing an asylum package since 1999."
"If there is a political imperative, then it is today, with North Africa - and the Mediterranean - in crisis."
"Talking about burden sharing should now lead to a practical and sensitive proposal."
"On behalf of my group, I want to say that Sylvie Guillaume has prepared - in cooperation, as Mrs Hohlmeier said, with all the shadows - a proposal which is both sensitive and effective, and really provides, as the Commissioner said, a cornerstone of the asylum package."
"This is why the vote on Wednesday is so vitally important."
"If we can repeat the majority that we achieved in committee, we can reach a position of completing an asylum package which pays attention to the many concerns and sensitivities across this House."
"If I can give you one example: I dealt with refugee cases for many years as an asylum lawyer, and I know that the enemy of good asylum procedure - fair, just, effective asylum procedure accepted by most Members States - is the lack of front-loading of asylum cases."
"The fact that there is poor quality decision making right across the European Union in many Member States leads to higher costs for Member States, not lower costs."
"So when Member States talk about the financial implications, they should understand that quality of decision making, getting it right the first time, and ensuring that the appeals procedure works effectively, is where we save money and where we are fair and just."
"If any Member doubts that this report is an effective, fair and just report, they should look at these procedures very carefully and understand that much work has gone into dealing with many of the potentially controversial aspects."
"It is also important to stress that the debate should not just be about cost: it is about harmonising practices across the EU."
"It is clear that standards vary too much between Member States."
"If we are going to continue with this kind of asylum lottery, we are not paying attention to the realities of asylum numbers going up."
"As we know, those asylum numbers have been plummeting for many years."
"Now we are in a more difficult position."
"The rules in the Procedures Directive cover perhaps the most complex part of the whole asylum package."
"That the procedure should be fair and effective can be a matter of life or death for those fleeing persecution."
"We have to recognise our responsibility in upholding international obligations when dealing with people seeking protection within our borders."
"Therefore, I want to congratulate the rapporteur and all the shadows for their dedicated efforts towards reaching a strong position in Parliament."
"Let us repeat the vote that we had in committee."
"Let us ensure that we send a strong signal to the Commission - but mainly to the Member States - that we are serious in this Parliament about completing the asylum package in a way that will be acceptable to many right across the House."
"Mr President, Mrs Malmström, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs most sincerely."
"We had very many debates."
"In the end, we reached some very good compromises, even though we all know that it is not always quite so easy, of course."
"On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, however, I would like to say that, in any case, we still have the goal of establishing a common, EU-wide asylum system by 2012."
"That also means that we must now make some real progress and also send a clear signal to the Council that we have not lost sight of this goal and that we are, of course, still prepared to enter into negotiations."
"That goes without saying."
"However, I also believe that we need to make it clear that, above all, we want a common asylum system."
"It is not acceptable, as has already been said, for it to be almost like a lottery depending on where an asylum seeker makes his application."
"It is not acceptable - and in this regard I am pleased that, at the last minute, we achieved success here - for every individual Member State to have its own national list of what constitutes a safe third country."
"Either a country is safe or it is not - and then it still must be examined in each individual case whether it can, in fact, be a safe third country for the particular person who has made an application or whether, in this individual situation, it is perhaps not possible to simply say that is the case as such."
"I am also convinced that, ultimately, the Member States will benefit from this, but so will the asylum seekers, who will have the chance, in future, to receive a ruling directly at the first instance in a fair and nevertheless rapid application procedure if this is implemented in the way that we envisage it."
"I believe this also to be a right; asylum is a right, not a favour."
"We must take an absolutely clear position on this and then also have a clear procedure."
"Above all, I welcome the fact that we have managed to further extend the rights of minors."
"I am in favour of that and so is the ALDE Group, and I will be pleased if we get a good result in this regard tomorrow."
"Mr President, the work that has been undertaken here on this report, under the guidance of Mrs Guillaume, is very important."
"As Mrs Malmström said, it is the cornerstone of the European asylum system, and it is true that there is a huge gap between the current situation and a European system."
"One ought, in fact, to call it an abyss, an abyss into which the rights of asylum seekers and the credibility of our protection system in Europe are sinking."
"When we have States whose rates of positive responses at first instance range from 1-65%, when we have, in a State such as France for example, 75% of the protection decisions granted to Kosovars or Albanians being delivered on appeal, when we know that those appeals do not have suspensive effect, we gain some idea of the state of the situation and we really feel that the Council should get a move on and see that the option that has been chosen by the European Commission - and which is strengthened by the high quality report drafted under the guidance of Mrs Guillaume - namely, to improve the quality of decision making at first instance, is absolutely crucial."
"As I understand it, the States that are shouting the loudest are not the ones paying, and nor are they the ones receiving the most asylum seekers."
"It should be remembered that Cyprus, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium receive the most asylum seekers when taken as a proportion of their population."
"Let us listen to those States too, then, because they can tell us what the best standards are when it comes to international protection for asylum seekers."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, I am very pleased to be having this debate today, with a view to the vote on Wednesday."
"Hopefully, our work will shake the Council out of its inertia and trigger productive negotiations, allowing us to fulfil our objective of having a common European asylum system by 2012 and thus taking into consideration the hard work we have all put into this file."
"I would like to warmly thank Mrs Guillaume for her excellent work and her conciliatory approach."
"On the whole, the result is a good text which includes significant improvements with respect to the asylum procedures currently implemented in the EU, which vary enormously from Member State to Member State."
"To name but a few, new provisions have been introduced to ensure each applicant is provided with adequate means to substantiate his or her claims in order to reach an asylum decision within a six-month period, such as the personal interview and free advice on procedural and legal aspects in first-instance procedures, including the preparation of the necessary procedural documents."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, the existing directive of 2005 on international protection is to be recast as the Reception Directive for asylum seekers."
"The new Reception Directive is a development of the EU's common immigration and asylum policy as laid out under the Lisbon Treaty."
"The new directive is intended to set up a new system for deciding the criteria for asylum seekers: who can and cannot enter Member States and qualify for refugee status and under what conditions."
"It is intended to harmonise Member States' asylum policy and give more rights and privileges to those seeking asylum."
"The current influx of people from North Africa is, of course, just another beneficial crisis that gives the EU another opportunity to extend its power and dominion."
"Immigration and asylum policy should be the sole prerogative of the independent sovereign nation state."
"This proposed directive is the Lisbon Treaty doing exactly what its opponents said it would do: which, of course, is why you refused to give the people of Europe a referendum on it."
"(NL) Mr President, my party, the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), has always been absolutely clear."
"We have been, and will remain, against a European asylum and immigration policy."
"Member States can decide on such matters perfectly well themselves."
"The present Dutch cabinet has been the best cabinet yet, with an excellent agenda for asylum and immigration policy."
"As far as that is concerned, Prime Minister Rutte and Minister Leers really do not need any interference from Europe."
"My party is a party which speaks plainly."
"What is today's debate actually about?"
"International protection."
"We simply call it 'asylum'."
"Especially at a time when we are dealing with disastrous mass immigration of non-Western immigrants, we should not be mincing words."
"Mr President, if it were up to Europe, we would throw all borders wide open and Europe would become a paradise for fortune seekers and profiteers, as if it were not one already."
"Look at Italy, look at Lampedusa."
"As far as Europe is concerned, all semi-criminal fortune seekers from Barbary would simply be included in the asylum procedure and would ultimately also be allowed to stay!"
"Mr President, could the Commissioner explain why Europe always has to take the strain?"
"Why are all those boats heading our way?"
"The only and the most appropriate solution is to provide relief to these refugees in the region."
"Just let the African Union, the Arabic League or the terrible Organisation of the Islamic Conference resolve this."
"It is them we should hold responsible for arranging shelter in the region, not ourselves."
"All the more perverse is the fact that, with this report, we are actually making it easier for them to enter the European Union."
"At the very moment that hordes of asylum seekers from Barbary are storming the European Union, we have to make asylum applications harder, not easier."
"(DE) Mr President, my fellow Member just spoke of hoards of barbarians coming to Europe."
"This form of cynicism cannot go unchallenged here."
"It is defamatory towards these people. I would ask you to reprimand him."
"(NL) Thank you, Mr President, I will correct that."
"I did not speak about barbarians."
"It may be that you heard that from the interpreters."
"I am talking about the historical name of this region, namely Barbary."
"You may have other names for this part of the world, but that is what I call it."
"I am not saying that people from Barbary are heading for our shores like barbarians."
"I would like that to be corrected."
"Mr van der Stoep, all these remarks will be in our record, so you can check them."
"All the original words, your reply and the second reply will be in that record."
"(SV) Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Guillaume, for her excellent and very hard work on this report, which represents a major part of the asylum package."
"All Member States must have fair and legally certain procedures for asylum seekers."
"The EU will never have a properly functioning asylum system if we do not have common minimum standards for processing applications and for the rights afforded to asylum seekers during this process."
"Of course, these provisions must not merely exist on paper, but must also be applied in practice in a consistent manner throughout Europe."
"That said, I think it is most regrettable that the Commission has announced its intention to table a new, watered-down proposal that is closer to what many governments in the Council want."
"In view of the Commission's position in this regard and of the mood within the Council, the vote on this report is even more important."
"The European Parliament must now send out a clear signal that in any event, we support the right to seek asylum and we believe that all asylum seekers deserve a fair and thorough investigation of their applications."
"The main method that is proposed, namely, that we should invest our resources in processing applications in the first instance, is absolutely the right thing to do and it will make matters easier for both the asylum seekers, who will be informed of the result more quickly, and the Member States, which will avoid the cost of further investigations as a result of the inadequate quality of the initial examination."
"There are a great many good amendments in the proposal, but I would like, in particular, to highlight one amendment which ensures that the needs of particularly vulnerable applicants are taken into account, particularly those of unaccompanied minors."
"The clear definition of family members that is proposed will also improve the situation for many minors in particular."
"(SL) Mr President, I would like to commend the excellent work done by the rapporteur, Mrs Sylvie Guillaume."
"The European Union urgently needs coordinated, fair and efficient asylum procedures."
"The need for these can be seen in the current crisis involving refugees from the Mediterranean."
"Common rules are in the interest of both Member States and asylum seekers."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the right to asylum is a key principle of human rights."
"Refugees should not be punished for crossing borders."
"Our fundamental task is to help all asylum seekers, to safeguard their basic human rights, and to ensure that high quality European standards are applied in considering their applications."
"Unfortunately, it seems that fewer and fewer European countries are respecting the rights of asylum, or that they are receiving immigrants with increasing fear and distrust."
"What is happening today on the Italian island of Lampedusa is alarming."
"It is giving rise to the threatening and distressing feeling that refugees are not wanted in the European Union."
"We must show solidarity with people who are fleeing trouble spots, particularly with those fleeing Libya, who need international protection."
"In light of the developments in Arab countries and in North Africa, we need to be prepared for the possibility of even more refugees arriving in the Union in the future."
"For that reason, too, we need to improve and coordinate procedures."
"That will help us make life easier both for ourselves and for the refugees."
"We will ease the burden of countries which currently operate more humane procedures for asylum seekers, and share the burden more fairly."
"Europe must not become a fortress."
"Asylum seekers must not become victims of our systems."
"I would like this report to be endorsed by a large majority on Wednesday."
"(EL) Mr President, I must agree with what has been said, that we all want a reliable and effective asylum procedure and we all want to safeguard these objectives."
"I too, however, shall cite an example from our experience in Greece a few months ago, during Parliament's official asylum mission."
"When we arrived at the airport, we visited the detention centre, which was holding a third-country national; he was brought before us and we spoke to him."
"He told us that he had applied for asylum and after a while, he started to speak to us in Greek."
"We asked him where he had learned to speak Greek and he replied: I speak Greek because I have been working in Greece for 10 years;"
"I went back to my country and returned and now I am applying for asylum."
"Let me explain: of course, we need to focus on the reliability and transparency of these procedures and to protect those who are entitled to asylum; however, we also need to watch out for abuse."
"There are provisions that need careful attention."
"I refer to a number of comments made by Mrs Hohlmeier, to which I would add this: we are saying that, after six months, the burden of proof for people being prosecuted in their country shifts to the Member State, not to the asylum seeker; this alone creates bureaucracy and may be used by some as an argument for abuse."
"(RO) Mr President, I want to begin by congratulating Mrs Guillaume for the fine job which she has done."
"The amendments tabled to the current Asylum Procedures Directive mark an extremely important step towards establishing a common asylum system throughout the European Union."
"The main added value of the new directive is the clarity of its rules and procedures."
"It sets out sound, transparent regulations on the authorities competent to consider international protection applications and guarantees that these applications are handled as quickly and efficiently as possible."
"We must absolutely ensure that the protection afforded across the entire European Union is of the highest standard."
"At the same time, it is important for us to continue to harmonise national legislations in order to avoid disparities between the asylum systems which currently exist throughout the European Union."
"Our ultimate aim must remain to create a proper common asylum system, as stipulated by the Stockholm Programme."
"(DE) Mr President, if there is one thing that is certain, then it is the following: on their own, some of the individual Member States of the European Union are overstretched in the area of asylum, and also in the area of migration and immigration, as we can clearly see from the developments of recent weeks, but also of the last few years."
"It is therefore necessary for the European Union to assume ever more responsibilities in this regard in order to ensure that the asylum system in the European Union operates in future according to principles that must be a matter of course for all of us, namely, uniform standards, fair and just procedures and respect for fundamental rights."
"On the other hand, however, we must also prevent the system from being abused, because that, of course, is always a problem that is discussed in great depth by people in the Member States."
"This task is difficult enough, and I hope that we will manage to do it successfully."
"(SK) Mr President, the draft of the submitted directive on minimum standards for hearings in Member States on the recognition and withdrawal of international protection is based on previous experience of asylum hearing procedures in individual Member States."
"The Commission's effort to introduce common procedures on granting and withdrawing a unitary asylum status or additional protection through improving the harmonisation of asylum hearing instruments and improving the quality of the hearings in order to cut the number of revised decisions, however, is running into numerous objections from the Council of the European Union and from some Member States."
"I firmly believe that the opinions of the Council and the Member States who ultimately implement the asylum hearings should be decisive for us."
"In my opinion, therefore, if we do not listen carefully to their comments and advice when amending the asylum system, then our work is unlikely to bring the desired effect."
"I therefore consider it very important to have further consultations over the prepared amendments, particularly with the relevant EU Member State bodies."
"(DE) Mr President, despite the influx of people from North Africa, the rapporteur clearly fears that there are too few refugees in the EU, as she calls for the definition of the family to be extended."
"It is apparently irrelevant whether the family members came together before or after fleeing from their country."
"New partners and adoptive children are also to be included in the new definition."
"Special protection is to be afforded to refugees with problems in relation to their gender identity, whatever the rapporteur means by that."
"Such wordings leave the door wide open to abuse."
"It is also naive to believe that asylum seekers can expect the same high level of social provision in any Member State."
"The European Union is made up of States with very different standards of living."
"The same applies to the concept of safe country of origin."
"If it is a democratic state based on the rule of law, it must also be classed as safe."
"Finally, as Tunisia and Egypt are heading in the right direction, they should probably also be classed as safe third countries."
"Mr President, international protection is a coded and euphemistic term for asylum."
"The word asylum has rightly lost its glamour in the eyes of the general public."
"Asylum seekers who pass by, or through, safe countries are migrants of choice, not genuine refugees."
"People who come to Europe simply because they come from unsafe countries might be unfortunate, but Europe cannot be expected to house the entire population of every unsafe country on earth."
"Genuine asylum seekers should seek refuge in the first safe country; one that will be culturally, religiously and ancestrally related to them."
"The role of Europe and the West should not be to act as a giant reception home for the vulnerable populations of the world."
"Our role should be to stop creating the instability that fuels these vast population movements: there must be no more wars such as those against Iraq and Afghanistan; we must pull out of Libya before we are drawn into a ground war; we must cancel the planned conflict with Iran and we must avoid encouraging discontent in other Middle Eastern states."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as has been said many times, we have been negotiating this for a very long time and - as Mr Moraes pointed out - we have had the objective of having a joint common asylum policy since 1999."
"The Council has made the decision to have this by 2012, and we are beginning to see an end to the deadlock that we have had for so many years."
"I would like to thank Parliament, because I think it has made a great contribution to this."
"We must have a fair, efficient and coherent system that is equivalent in all Member States."
"It has been very clear from the beginning, in my contact with the different rapporteurs on the whole package, that there would have to be some amendments."
"This is not something that the Commission just came up with. The deadlock is such that we need to make some compromises so that the two legislative partners in this can agree."
"With the vote that you will be making tomorrow or on Wednesday and with the Commission's proposals in this, we will be in a good position to try to see if we can find some compromises."
"We have been involved in contacting the Council throughout the spring in order to identify the main difficulties here."
"If we want to achieve an agreement on the asylum package by 2012 and thus commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Geneva Convention - I think we all want to do that - we must be ready to make some compromises."
"This is a very good start."
"It is the cornerstone of the future system."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, all the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for this work."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by offering my thanks for all of the speeches - well, nearly all of them."
"Mrs Hohlmeier has left, but I hope that someone will tell her that I have not given up hope of convincing her that Tunisian nationals are not claiming asylum throughout the European Union and that, consequently, there is little reason for them to make a second successive claim."
"I wish to make two small points by way of conclusion, but they are nonetheless ones which I consider rather crucial."
"I should like to stress that the aim is not to turn the Member States against the principle of upwards harmonisation, quite the contrary."
"I can understand that there is some resistance and some misgivings, but I would also like them to understand that they have everything to gain by investing in proper, effective procedures at first instance."
"The proposed reforms are along these lines."
"The second key point, to conclude, is to affirm that Parliament has an important role to play."
"We are colegislators."
"The European Commission has indicated on several occasions that it wants us to play an absolutely fundamental part in the follow-up to this procedure."
"Well, on Wednesday, we will have the opportunity to state loud and clear our priorities for genuinely harmonised procedures in this area."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on the report by Mrs Guillaume will take place at noon on Wednesday, 6 April 2011."
"Dual-use items and technology (debate)"
"Τhe next item is the report by Mr Leichtfried, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the Community regime for the control of exports of dual-use items and technology - C7-0062/2010 -."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when I took on the task of preparing the report on the control of exports of dual-use items and technology, although I had some idea of the scope of this report, I did not realise quite how extensive it was."
"This report is essentially about a practice that somehow always ends up in the shadows of reports, but which, on the other hand, safeguards jobs and, in my opinion, must be regulated throughout Europe."
"It is essentially about facilitation of export licences for products that can be used for both military and civil purposes."
"These include everything from chemicals to nuclear fuels, weapon parts, computer components and ultimately - and we debated this very intensively - even software and software components."
"In my view, it is important that the different regulations that we currently have in the Member States are brought into closer harmony, that they are made more precise, more specific and also more transparent, and, above all, that they can attain transparency at European level."
"With this report, it was probably possible to see the consequences of the Treaty of Lisbon for us in the European Parliament properly for the first time."
"The Commission originally put this proposal to the Council in the belief that the matter would perhaps be settled by the time the Treaty of Lisbon was concluded."
"That was not the case, however."
"Thus, it has also come to the European Parliament, and I think it is good that it is being debated in this House, because we see some things, which I will now come to, in a different way to the Council."
"We have succeeded in overcoming certain legal complications that arose as a result of the method employed by the Commission."
"I would like, in particular, to thank the representatives of the Commission for the fact that we have succeeded in regulating the matter in such a way that, from a legal point of view, we are now on a safer footing."
"Finally, just a few key problems remain."
"In this House, we are essentially in agreement on everything, with one exception, and in that regard we are not in agreement with the Council, either."
"It concerns the question of whether exports should be authorised after they have taken place or before they take place."
"In this regard, it is sensible, for reasons of safety, oversight and transparency, to ensure that someone asks first before something hazardous is exported and does not retrospectively apply for authorisation after these products have already been exported, as we will then probably not be very successful in prohibiting this export."
"That is the familiar ex post - ex ante debate: in my opinion, it would make more sense for authorisation to be granted first and then for the products to be exported."
"Where we are all in agreement - although not with the Council - is on the subject of transparency in respect of the reporting obligation."
"I think that the European Parliament should ultimately be informed - how that is achieved from a technical point of view can be discussed - of what, where and how much has been authorised, because we are clearly the body that has to ensure that everything is carried out properly."
"It is also important for us to discuss how we should deal with exports of devices that could possibly be used in violations of human rights."
"I think that such exports should not be permitted."
"We must ensure that that is the case."
"I now look forward to the debate."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, every day, European businesses have to compete in an ever-changing and more competitive environment."
"The questions of dependability and timely delivery are as important as those of quality and price."
"Exports of dual-use items create particular challenges in this regard, as such exports are subject to authorisation requirements."
"Dual-use items are not niche goods."
"They are very much items legitimately used in a broad variety of industrial sectors - the space industry, the telecommunications industry, aviation, the chemical industry and many others."
"The goods are controlled because they could also potentially be used for military purposes."
"Many Member States make special export facilitations available to their exporters."
"These facilitations take the form of general licences and allow businesses in certain Member States to export dual-use items with the minimum burden."
"Following an analysis of these national facilitation measures, in 2008, the Commission put forward its proposal aimed at extending these national facilitations to exporters throughout the Union."
"The proposal for a new EU general export authorisation is designed to allow exporters in all Member States to reap the benefits of simplified export procedures for certain dual-use items to certain destinations."
"In this way, participation in international exhibitions and fairs will become easier."
"Exporting items after they have been repaired will also become simpler, and exports of telecommunications equipment and certain industrial chemicals will be simplified."
"On the other hand, Member States will be able to concentrate their limited resources on transactions that actually do pose a risk."
"The Commission regularly receives complaints from industry that certain exports are being prevented from entering one Member State while identical transactions are given a green light in other Member States."
"The proposal in front of you is a first step towards eliminating these inequalities within our Single Market."
"Many other countries are taking similar steps to prioritise their work on export control, and we should not be left behind."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried, and other Members for their very constructive work on the proposal."
"The report presented by you and your committee is definitely a step in the right direction and is broadly consistent with the Commission's view."
"Mr President, Commissioner, before us we have a subject that affects trade and security to equal degrees."
"Dual-use items are products with two uses."
"That means that they can have both a civil use, as well as a perfectly sensible or downright dangerous, but in any case security-relevant, use."
"Some parties, for example, the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology, claim that these are - and I quote - 'non-critical items'."
"That is incorrect."
"This Parliament has previously taken a more responsible position in its committees."
"I speak as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence."
"In these committees, we have taken a very clear position."
"We believe that it would be extremely negligent not to take certain control mechanisms into consideration."
"I would therefore like to appeal to my fellow Members to follow the recommendations of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence and, in particular, the recommendations of the rapporteur, who has just spoken, with regard to the question of ex ante control."
"This is the one major controversial issue that we still face with regard to this matter."
"To perform checks only after the event would result in less security."
"However, we want more security for EU citizens and also more security for our partner countries and trade partners."
"We do not want the principle of ex ante control - which the Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Foreign Affairs have followed - to now be replaced by the principle of ex post control."
"That would place trade interests above security interests."
"Many Member States, the Netherlands for example, have expressly warned against this."
"It would therefore undoubtedly be in the interests of our citizens for the plenary to confirm what the committees have drawn up."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Dual-Use Regulation under debate provides for the acquisition of general authorisations for non-critical items and technologies that are exported to third countries and fulfil a dual purpose."
"However, these general authorisations are also intended to enable European exporters and small and medium-sized enterprises to plan reliably."
"This regulation is intended to represent a relaxation for our European exporters in order to spare them time-consuming individual authorisation procedures and, above all, also to enhance their competitiveness."
"I therefore think that detailed registration procedures and the additional requirements imposed on exporters will not result in a relaxation, but rather additional expenditure."
"There is no doubt that we must ensure that exports that fulfil dual purposes are also used in a safe manner and cannot present a danger, but, in any case, we also have to question the excessive and unnecessary additional expenditure."
"I could give the example of a medium-sized enterprise in the field of mechanical engineering that offers a 24-hour service for repairing machines and supplying machine parts."
"These services must also continue to be possible despite more stringent export provisions."
"The same applies in the area of cyber attacks and the involvement of stakeholders."
"If we do not have clear criteria and framework conditions for these areas, and if the wordings are imprecise, then I have to question the additional expenditure and the generalisation here too."
"Although it is extremely important to involve stakeholders in decision-making processes, this must always be done with a view to the practical and sensible implementation of the decisions."
"Here, too, there is no question that transparency and security are essential."
"Finally, I would like to stress once again that this regulation is intended to contribute to a facilitation of the procedure and a reduction in bureaucracy."
"Against the background of the safe use of products and technologies, it is intended to strengthen our European economy and simplify the associated administration."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague for the exceptional work he has done on this report, which is so technical, but which entails real implications for the security of Europe's citizens."
"The European Union has been enforcing export control measures on dual-use items for nearly 15 years."
"The adoption of preventive measures such as export licensing requirements and customs registration enables the European Union to take care to avoid the proliferation of weapons, especially weapons of mass destruction."
"However, the European Union's dual-use regime needs to be more transparent and democratic."
"A secure system must be set up where notifications about exports involving items which can be used for both civil and military purposes will be collected, transmitted and stored to prevent the danger of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"I also welcome the rapporteur's proposal calling on the Dual-Use Coordination Group to submit an annual report to the European Parliament to help the latter fulfil its control function."
"It is the duty of the European Commission, in turn, to inform Parliament about the implementation of the regulation's provision on setting up a Community regime for the control of exports of dual-use items and technologies and to submit an impact study for the measures being proposed."
"Last but not least, the European Union's representation in international export control regimes needs to be improved."
"Unfortunately, the lists of items to be controlled are updated by the international regimes and transposed into European Union legislation without the European Parliament being able to participate in this process."
"This is why I call for better control from Parliament and for its legislative role to be facilitated, as assigned by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for time immemorial, if there is one trade that is difficult to control, it is the arms trade."
"There are various ways to make this control difficult."
"One is to trade in apparently harmless weapons or techniques that can easily become a weapon, and that is why we are concerned with dual use in the regulation."
"Another difficulty is the plethora of rules that make any control system ineffective."
"When we started working on this case, the Commission asked us to amend a regulation dating from 2000."
"Meanwhile, this has been revoked and we were called on to amend the more recent 2009 regulation on the basis of the same obsolete proposal."
"We have just entered trialogue and we already have a new legislative proposal from the Commission, again to amend the regulation."
"The first request is therefore to establish clear, simple and transparent rules for European exporters having a consolidated text."
"Four points on the position of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE)."
"With regard to shipments of low value, we in the ALDE concur with the Council in being very sceptical about this system."
"Parliament has already limited the maximum value from EUR 5 000 to 3 000 and imposed various other criteria."
"The list of destination countries is very limited."
"This is something that small and medium-sized businesses legitimately want, but our main message is that we want security above all, as well as trade, and we must go back to work on this in the trialogue."
"We support the policy of ex ante notification and the obligation of registration by Member States."
"Finally, we demand the maximum degree of transparency to ensure that the regulation provides a mechanism which informs stakeholders, such as human rights or peace monitoring and trade unions organisations, of the various stages that made up the decision-making process, including through a report to the European Parliament"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried, for his work on this report and, on behalf of my group, I wish him every success in the undoubtedly difficult negotiations with the Council, which is unfortunately not present at this debate."
"However, I would like to mention two aspects."
"The amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) are not helpful to the rapporteur, but undermine the negotiating position of Parliament defined in the Committee on International Trade."
"The amendments seek to make life easier for arms exporters."
"Therefore, my group will not support these amendments."
"Secondly, I would like to state that my group has considerable problems with the use of the dual-use list to block the access of developing countries in particular to high technology."
"This relates, in particular, to restrictions on the export of high-performance computers."
"We have seen the potential for the political abuse of the dual-use list, particularly in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"For this reason, we have drawn up Amendment 47, and I would ask for your support for this amendment in the interests of the developing countries."
"(DE) Mr President, nuclear fuels, chemicals and computer programmes can be used for peaceful purposes, but they can also be used for military purposes."
"Some Member States have been supplying Libya with weapons and even with torture equipment for years."
"The most recent arms export report - more like a list of sins - clearly shows that Italy, Malta and Germany supplied the most weapons to Gaddafi."
"France, on the other hand, was the front-runner with regard to supplies to the Arab region."
"Others - like my country, Austria - abide by the restrictions."
"We must combat this imbalance."
"All Member States and the entire weapons industry in the EU must observe strict controls and transparency provisions."
"However, the system must also be kept up-to-date."
"Particularly with regard to software, IT and smart phones, it needs to be considered whether these will not be of benefit to democratic movements, as we have recently seen in the Arab region, of course."
"We therefore need more discriminating analyses with regard to the potential uses and the dubiousness of the recipients."
"(SV) Mr President, the number of products covered by this legislation that can be used for both civil and military purposes is far greater than we first thought."
"It includes everything from lorries to aeroplane jet engines and telecommunications equipment."
"I therefore think it is important to point out that the direct reference to the weapons industry in this regard is often misleading."
"It also makes this legislation important in terms of simplifying and harmonising the way in which we handle products in Europe that can be used for both civil and military purposes."
"It must be stringent, predictable and clear, but also harmonised."
"Every time I hear about a Swedish company that is denied the chance to export to another country for reasons relating to EU legislation, only to then discover that a French company, for example, is perfectly able to export the same products, it is clear that the EU has failed."
"We must remember that trade is essentially a good thing."
"I am thinking of telecommunications equipment, for example, which is incredibly important for democracy movements around the world."
"This proposal must not make civil trade more difficult and subject to more bureaucracy."
"I am therefore opposed to the proposal to introduce an ex ante declaration."
"Modern, just-in-time delivery systems, service agreements and so on make it extremely difficult for fully legitimate products that we want to export and see more of."
"Most companies know exactly what these products are."
"Even if they apply an ex post notification, they know that they will be penalised if they export anything."
"I think it is important to simplify trade."
"We need to ensure that the legislation is stringent, clear and harmonised, but also simple."
"This does not fit well with having an ex ante check of everything that is exported."
"For example, it makes it more difficult to send important telecommunications equipment to countries that need it."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to thank you very much, if I may, for giving me the floor."
"Our problem concerns the fact that not all of the EU's Member States apply the same criteria with regard to the export of dual-use items."
"I therefore think that we should aim to ensure that all EU Member States apply the same high standards in respect of the export of civilian products which can be used for military purposes."
"I believe that this regulation should, in particular, highlight the need to prevent the unjustified and undesirable proliferation of technologies and their software, since the number of attacks involving modern technologies and software is increasing."
"I think that this would be an effective way to combat cyber-terrorism."
"Mr President, the topic of the report is doubly sensitive, both politically and economically."
"On the one hand, the EU wants to prevent dual-used goods to be used for military purposes and/or against people."
"On the other hand, it has to consider the economic interests of producers and users."
"The regulation is therefore inevitably bushy, having to cover for both existing intentional loopholes and anticipate for others in the future."
"Moreover, while for some, the regulation would appear too strong, for others it would appear too weak, requiring constant revision."
"As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I fully support the need for a more transparent and stricter regulation."
"I am therefore totally in favour of authorisation before export and not vice versa."
"Particularly after Lisbon, Parliament can only help, and this is exactly what it is doing here and now."
"Consequently, its role should be strengthened, not overlooked."
"(DE) Mr President, when it comes to the export authorisation for dual-use items, we are probably all agreed that we need uniform rules in the European Union so that the Member States do not all follow different practices, which would lead to distortions of competition and achieve precisely the opposite of what we actually want."
"Of course, it sounds logical when we say that exports should be authorised and approved in advance."
"We want more transparency and we want this to be monitored so that we can learn from it."
"In this regard, I would like to express my support for Mrs Köstinger, who said that we obviously need a system that is bearable for our small and medium-sized enterprises and one with which they can cope."
"The world market is not only for large concerns, but also for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"That would also be my appeal to the rapporteur, namely, to ensure that the conditions and requirements laid down are also bearable for, and capable of being implemented by, our small and medium-sized enterprises."
"(PT) Mr President, the problem with using civilian products and technologies for military purposes is that there is no approach to it that does not become tied up with controlling exports of what are known as 'dual-use products and related services'."
"This control of exports is important, and should be carried out in a rigorous manner, which does not adversely affect developing countries' access to the products and technologies required for their development."
"It is important to increase the transparency of the relevant processes and to enable democratic scrutiny of them."
"However, there is also a need for consistency in this area between other European Union policies and the objectives of this regulation."
"For example, we recall the research projects financed by the Seventh Framework Programme, especially those being engaged in with the participation of the Israeli aerospace industry, which manufactured unmanned aircraft used in the attack on the Gaza Strip in 2008 and 2009, causing the deaths of dozens of people."
"There is also a need for a rigorous assessment of possible dual civilian military use of the results of these programmes."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, on behalf of Mr De Gucht, I would again like to thank the rapporteur and his committee for the work they are doing."
"The Commission very much shares the views in their report and on the two remaining issues where they propose one ex ante system."
"The most important thing for the Commission is that it is the same system, because we have to avoid all kinds of double standards and over-complications here."
"We also agree with you that some kind of reporting mechanism is necessary - without, of course, posing an exaggerated burden on small and medium-sized companies in particular."
"However, some kind of reporting mechanism would be necessary, and I hope that you will be able to reach a conclusion with the Council on these remaining issues later. Thank you again for this debate, Mr President."
"Mr President, I wanted to use the last two minutes to appeal to the Council."
"However, there are only empty seats where the Council is supposed to be."
"I am not sure whether it is sensible to conduct debates without the Council."
"I think it would be appropriate to inform the Council that, if it wants something from the European Parliament, it ought to come here and listen to the relevant debate in this House."
"I know that this matter concerns a large branch of industry."
"It concerns a lot of items and it concerns jobs, particularly jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises which produce high technology and which are incredibly important."
"For them, it is extremely important that there are uniform regulations in the European Union and that we do not have a situation where - as Mr Fjellner mentioned - one country meets its obligations, but another does not, and, in the end, the ones that lose out are those that abide by the rules."
"That should not be the case."
"It is therefore important for us to find a solution quickly and also for the Council to accept that not everything is as it perceives it to be."
"This is also important."
"With this realisation, we will quickly reach a solution in the interests of European industry, European jobs and the protection of human rights and the preservation of security and of freedom from injury outside the European Union."
"This report is intended to facilitate this."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on the report by Mr Leichtfried will take place tomorrow at noon."
"European statistics on tourism (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Brian Simpson, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, concerning European statistics on tourism - C7-0085/2010 - (Α7-0329/2010)."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I would first of all like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts on what is actually quite a technical report."
"The Commission's proposal on tourism statistics has given us a good opportunity to revise the existing legal framework on the collection of statistical data on tourism in Europe."
"This is especially relevant at this time, when all eyes are on developing a strategy for European tourism policy on the back of the new EU competences in this field."
"Updating our tourism statistics database can, in turn, play an important role in giving policy makers a good basis for implementing successful tourism policies."
"For these reasons, the approach that I took, supported by our shadows, in formulating Parliament's position, was to strongly support the aim of improving the completeness, relevance and comparability of the statistics on offer in this field, bringing the statistics more up to date with new trends in the tourism sector to reflect, for instance, the increase in Internet bookings and in short-stay trips."
"We are all agreed that improving the competitiveness of EU tourism is a way to keep visitors coming to Europe, so it is important that the statistics we collect keep pace with the changing nature of the sector, identifying current and potential trends in that sector and monitoring supply and demand."
"In this way, the statistics collected can be a useful tool for supporting the decision maker in the tourism industry."
"On the one hand, it is also important to ensure that the updated statistics are as complete as possible, giving a good overview of tourism across Europe, whilst, on the other hand, bearing in mind the need to keep the burden down for respondents."
"It was for that reason that I was keen to see a final agreement on incoming data collection on same-day visits, which we now have in the final agreement, as same-day visits account for a large part of tourism activity."
"Parliament also pushed for the regulation to cover areas of data collection which, until now, have not been thought of as relevant for tourism statistics but which we felt needed to be included as part of the recognition of tourism's important social, economic and environmental impact."
"I thought that the collection of data on employment and economic expenditure - the so-called tourism satellite accounts - was particularly relevant in this regard and we pushed hard for this to be included as part of the regulation."
"The final agreement with Council now includes a provision on drawing up pilot studies that will enable Member States to show the effects of tourism on the economy and on employment, which I hope will contribute to a better understanding of the true size and value of our tourism industry."
"The final agreement also sees the inclusion of pilot studies that show the effect of tourism on the environment - an interesting avenue to pursue, given the need for a sustainable tourism approach."
"The inclusion of data on accessibility to tourist accommodation for persons with reduced mobility, which was the only real sticking point that we had with Council, is also now an important inclusion."
"Following Parliament's insistence on this point, Council finally backed down and agreed to its inclusion as part of the basic information collected from tourist accommodation establishments."
"Together with the agreements that we have reached on restricting the delegation of powers to the Commission - which I also had some concerns about - I am very pleased that first-reading agreement has been found with Council."
"I hope Parliament will lend its strong support to the agreement in Wednesday's plenary vote."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, in these times of austerity, the Commission is rationalising as well."
"Mr Simpson, as rapporteur you said that this is a technical report, and it is indeed, but nevertheless it is an important one."
"The purpose of the proposal from the Commission was to update and optimise the existing legal framework for European statistics on tourism."
"Both producers and users of tourism statistics have requested this adjustment."
"So the ultimate aim is to provide monthly and annual European statistics on tourism supply and demand using a common framework."
"The proposal is very well balanced in terms of data needs and the burden put on respondents and administrators."
"To achieve this, permission has been included to collect some parts of the data on an optional basis or every third year, to defer the entry into force of certain provisions to a later stage, and to exclude the smallest enterprises."
"Following an informal trialogue held on 12 January 2011 and further discussions, as you mentioned, rapporteur, a compromise text was agreed between Parliament and the Council."
"In particular, the Council agreed to an additional demand from Parliament of having the variable concerning the accessibility of tourist accommodation for persons with reduced mobility included in the regulation."
"All amendments in the report and the compromise text are acceptable to the Commission."
"Therefore, I would like to thank you, Mr Simpson, and the shadow rapporteurs and the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism for your constructive work on the proposal."
"Following fruitful cooperation between all three institutions, I believe that we have now reached our objective, which is the establishment of a common framework for the systematic development, production and dissemination of European statistics on tourism."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking the rapporteur for his commitment and his skills of political succinctness."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will wholeheartedly support the compromise reached with the Council."
"This regulation replaces the text in force since 1995, which no longer reflects today's reality on some key issues, such as new needs and new user habits, the need for more timely data and improved comparability, and completeness of the statistical framework."
"The final text incorporates all the policy priorities supported by the PPE during the negotiations; in particular, a better definition of the parts of the regulation amendable by delegated acts, introduction of the definition of 'same-day visits', which is essential for including in the collection of statistics all those who travel within a single day, thereby also including the phenomenon of conference tourism, a better definition of the statistics to be collected, including expenditure by tourists in transit for food and drink in bars and restaurants, which represents a substantial part of our tourism industry, accepted - even if only on a voluntary basis - by the Council, and data on accessibility for people with reduced mobility."
"The rapporteur has already duly noted that this is a key point for the Parliamentary delegation."
"In conclusion, this regulation is an important element within the new European tourism strategy that all the European institutions are examining."
"This will permit an updated legal framework that is in step with market developments and offers a clearer and more coherent approach to collecting data on tourism, and it will also ensure more effective monitoring of the sector for a better understanding of consumer needs."
"I again express my thanks to Mr Simpson, the Commission for the initiative, and the Council for its excellent mediation."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate my colleague, Brian Simpson, for this report on the EU regulation establishing a common framework for developing, producing and distributing European statistics on tourism."
"It is the task of Member States to collect, compile, process and transmit harmonised European statistics on tourism supply and demand."
"The majority of businesses in the tourism sector are small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Their strategic importance is not just restricted to their economic value but, above all, the considerable potential they offer in terms of job creation must also be recognised."
"According to the Eurostat data for 2007, one European family in three could not afford to take a one-week holiday every year."
"The economic crisis has increased the number of European citizens vulnerable to the risk of poverty."
"As a result, there has been an even bigger fall in the number of those who can afford to have a weekly holiday every year."
"I therefore think that the tourism statistics are necessary and also relevant in terms of assessing the social aspect of this sector."
"Social tourism boosts the number of European tourists and helps counter the seasonal nature of tourism, reinforce the idea of European citizenship, as well as foster regional development."
"Social tourism statistics would enable the Commission and Member States to identify the specific needs of different social groups and devise suitable programmes."
"When compiling European statistics under this regulation, national statistical authorities should also provide data on the funds used for tourism by each Member State, in particular, where EU funds are used."
"Last but not least, I think that European tourism statistics should also include data about the staff employed, their seasonal nature, professional training and qualifications, as well as information about their current working conditions."
"We cannot have a high quality tourism sector without well-trained staff."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the committee Chair, Brian Simpson, for leading the work of the committee and work on the file, and, above all, for having allowed its conclusion - at least I hope so because the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) will be voting for this - and approval on first reading, and hence the successful conclusion of the regulation."
"This task actually involves reviewing the regulation, which sets out to establish a common framework for the collection of statistics on tourism and, more specifically, for all its stages, ranging from the collection to the processing, treatment and transmission of statistics, enabling optimum knowledge of the financial world that is activated and revolves around tourism."
"Mr President, it is clear that, since the 1995 directive, which is the predecessor of this directive, remarkable growth has been recorded in tourism and we must acknowledge, in particular, the great prospects that the economic system of tourism will contribute to the European economy as a whole in the near future."
"I worked on the file as a shadow rapporteur for the ALDE Group and, as I said earlier, we are going to vote in favour of it."
"I think the Simpson report will be particularly popular due to the notion of tourism satellite accounts, namely, the adoption of pilot projects that will make it possible to assess the economic impact on individual sectors of the economy, in other words, aspects relating to same-day visits, the evaluation report to be drawn up every five years and the possibility, indeed the necessity, of a five-yearly report to assess the effects of statistics."
"I will conclude by saying that this is part of the new responsibility arising out of the Treaty of Lisbon and I think this time, we are beginning to assume the responsibilities of Parliament effectively and we will do the same with the next file being worked on, soon to arrive in this Chamber."
"Mr President, it is a known fact that the European Union is the number one tourist destination in the world."
"Tourism accounts for 4% of GDP in the EU, 2 million undertakings are involved in it, and it pays for approximately 8 million jobs."
"As such, Mr Simpson's report on the Commission's proposal for a directive revising the legal basis for European statistics on tourism is important and comes at a crucial time for the future of tourism, given that the economic crisis and the recent military operations in the Mediterranean represent a threat to tourism and, at the same time, create conditions for diverting tourism to safe destinations in Europe."
"We call on the Commission, in addition to collating statistics, to incorporate all measures relating to tourism and the numerous tourism-related sectors, so that we can ultimately upgrade the tourism product."
"In Greece, tourism is a pillar of the economy, representing 7% of GDP and providing 700 000 jobs."
"Mr President, in order to make sound decisions in any industry whatever, we need to be armed with as much in the way of information and statistics as possible and to ensure that regions are spending their money properly in developing a product that has such huge potential."
"I welcome this report."
"Statistics are absolutely vital."
"However, they are useless if we cannot compare them, and this report by Brian Simpson goes a considerable way towards ensuring that the information which is now being collected, and will be collected in the future, is easily accessible and can easily be used positively for the benefit of the industry itself."
"I welcome the work that Mr Simpson has done and, as he has said, he has the unanimous support of the committee and quite a number of committee members are here now."
"I also share his concern about the quantity of the delegated acts the Commission wants to have."
"I would much rather see changes to the fundamentals of this framework decided under ordinary legislative procedures."
"We are MEPs from the different member countries, we have our finger on the pulse, we know exactly what the situation is in our Member States and, without in any way showing disrespect to the Commission, I would say that we are the people who ultimately know what the product is and what the potential is."
"Until 2004, we had regional development, transport and tourism all under the one heading."
"In 2004, those areas were divided between committees, and we now have transport and tourism in one and regional development in another."
"As far as transport and tourism are concerned, tourism is still very much the Cinderella."
"It is an area of huge potential, an area that can develop into something even greater than we are talking about."
"Our colleague over here mentioned 4% of GDP."
"But if you look at it, you see, for example, that Europe is the number one destination in the world, accounting for 40% of global arrivals in 2008."
"Tourism represents 9.7 million jobs every year."
"So what we are talking about here is a mosaic of different countries, different cultures, with huge potential."
"We have only dipped our toe in the water; we have only started to tap its potential and we need to drive forward from here."
"Above all else, if we are to drive forward and develop tourism, we need the kind of report that Brian Simpson has produced and we need to work on it."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to warmly congratulate the speaker, Mr Simpson, on the agreement he has achieved in an area as technical as tourism statistics, having fought every inch of the way."
"However, Mr President, this is a sector in which we are talking about more than 2 million companies, many of which are, of course, small and medium-sized enterprises, providing almost 10 million jobs; a sector that is extremely labour-intensive and in which human resources, and the quality of these resources, are fundamental aspects; a sector that accounts for 5% of the European Union's gross domestic product."
"We are really talking about one of the most important sectors of the European economy, given that the European Union is also the world's number one tourist destination."
"In short, the Union enjoys a leading position that, until recently, has been left too much to the vagaries of the market and prevailing circumstances, with the severe inequalities and wastage that these imply."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has finally given us precisely the legal basis we needed for a new tourism policy in the European Union, which the European Parliament had been calling for through a range of pilot and preparatory projects."
"Last year's Commission communication set out the new goals for these powers, and the need to strengthen the tourism sector through better coordination and complementarity with the Member States."
"It stated that better, comparable, exhaustive, up-to-date and reliable data were needed to achieve this, and this is precisely why Mr Simpson's report has set out these new directions and requirements."
"It extends the criteria for defining the great diversity of tourism, not just holiday tourism, but also social tourism, etc. It highlights the need to make accessibility for people with reduced mobility a more visible issue, includes the environmental factor, and opens the way towards taking the tourism satellite accounts into consideration in order to gain a much more reliable economic picture."
"It also combines new aspects and criteria, such as short day trips and data relating to the restaurant trade, which are of such importance to a tourism-focused country like Spain."
"All these new data will help to provide a much better understanding of this sector, which is such an intensive generator of the employment we need."
"These new statistics mean we will be better placed to modernise and tackle the future challenges of a sector that must form the bedrock of a large part of Europe 2020, above all, in terms of the intensive creation of jobs, which should be of good quality."
"Thank you very much."
"Now I give the floor to Mrs Meissner."
"You have one minute."
"(DE) Mr President, I would first of all like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Simpson."
"In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we know that, if our Chair prepares a report, we will not actually have anything to say against it."
"He always takes a great number of things into account, and the only thing we can say is: excellent Brian, we can support that."
"In this case, it has been variously said that it is a technical report."
"That sounds so boring."
"I do not find it at all boring."
"Although it is technical, it describes tourism, which really is a very important economic objective for us in Europe."
"It has already been mentioned that 40% of people worldwide travel to Europe."
"Thus, Europe is an important region for tourism, and therefore it is, of course, vital to know why these people travel to Europe."
"If, with our new competence under the Treaty of Lisbon, we now want to develop a new European framework, we must be familiar with the data and also be able to exchange this data in a harmonised way."
"That is the purpose of this report, and it also shows the new developments, for example, in terms of same-day visits or bicycle tourism."
"We also want to include our industrial heritage."
"All of this must be included in future so that we will really know how to set our objectives."
"Therefore, thank you very much - it is a good report and I believe we are able to support it."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I think we are all agreed on the importance of tourism."
"It plays a very important role not only for citizens in Europe, but also for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Statistical data are crucially important."
"Only by creating a reliable and complete database will we be able to make policy that enables tourism to realise its full potential."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on his work, and my colleague, Mr Fidanza, has just presented the position of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"For my part, I would just like to raise three fairly general points."
"Firstly, I believe that we must make real use of the new political means afforded to us by the Treaty and create added value for the Member States."
"My second point is that, since the various EU financial funds are, and will be, increasingly under pressure, it is very important to compare the results of the various Member States and to opt for the best practices, thereby achieving a certain degree of harmonisation where everyone gains."
"My third and final point is that we need to develop tourism satellite accounts, which Canada has had for years."
"This would enable us to determine even more effectively the repercussions for the economy, jobs, the environment and so on, and hence to respond to a number of issues in all political fields connected with tourism."
"(RO) Mr President, I find regrettable the complete lack of any kind of official statistics on rural tourism and agritourism, with the only data available being based on estimates."
"In this circumstance, I welcome the actions envisaged by the European Commission aimed at increasing the socio-economic knowledge base for tourism."
"I also wish to emphasise the importance of the 'ICT and tourism' platform proposed by the Commission."
"However, I think that efforts need to be stepped up to equip rural areas with a state-of-the-art IT infrastructure, for instance, by providing broadband Internet."
"More than 500 000 accommodation establishments are involved in rural tourism and agritourism, offering more than 6 million beds."
"Both these sectors have seen average annual growth of 10-15% in recent years, thereby making a vital contribution to improving the quality of life in rural areas and to the diversification of the rural economy."
"Mr President, out of respect for the rapporteur I will try my luck in English and hope it will be good enough!"
"It is very important when we think about tourism that we recognise what a huge economic factor tourism already is within the European Union."
"It is also a huge factor regarding work space, and especially regarding small and medium-sized enterprises, which do much business within the field of tourism."
"We also have to recognise that tourism has not only positive values, but also causes problems - problems related to transport, to overcrowded beaches, and so on. To solve these things, we need good statistics, good data."
"This report helps us with that. It is a very good report and everybody should support it."
"(ES) Mr President, all I wanted to do was to slightly contradict what Mr Leichtfried has said to spice up the debate a little."
"I understand Mr Leichtfried as saying that tourism causes transport problems."
"I believe, in fact, that what transport does is to improve and promote tourism and that, therefore, just now when we are reviewing the trans-European transport networks in Europe, we should bear this very much in mind, as there is evidence that better, smoother running transport, with greater capacity and less environmental impact, is a key element for the tourist sector."
"I therefore hope that, in the future, the funding of the trans-European networks, and the data that we receive from this, will also improve the capacity of the tourism sector in Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, it would be nice if questions regarding the reasons for success as a tourist destination - in other words, why one destination is in demand whereas others are seeing a fall in visitor numbers - could be answered using informative statistics."
"However, that is a wish that will probably not be fulfilled."
"Too many uncertain factors, such as particular weather conditions, turn tourism predictions into a game of chance."
"It is not even possible to say with certainty whether the opening of new flight connections is increasing the number of overnight stays or whether, on the contrary, new flight connections are a result of increasing demand on the part of travellers."
"However, the limited availability and comparability of tourism data is also a problem from the point of view of town planning."
"At the end of the day, if a potential increase in visitor numbers is forthcoming, it is important to organise this in such a way as to avoid it having a negative impact on the local population."
"Flexible working hours and safety influence tourism just as much as social changes."
"The decisive factors, however, will probably ultimately be the global economy and perhaps the price of oil."
"Even the best European tourism statistics can do little to change these."
"(RO) Mr President, Mr Simpson's report is an important milestone as regards the European statistical framework for tourism."
"Given its high potential, tourism therefore contributes to employment and economic growth."
"The efficiency in processing the data and comparability of the statistics supplied need to be improved."
"With the aim of tackling the global competition in the tourism sector, Romania has devised for itself in a professional manner a strategy which makes it stand out from other tourist destinations in the world."
"The strategy is based on Romania's branding as a country, which is a concept we are using to present to prospective tourists the authentic nature of our traditions and the wonderful landscapes we have."
"I should emphasise that developing tourism could also help reduce inequalities in the regions of south-eastern Europe."
"The focus must therefore be on diversity."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to point out that, unfortunately, the European Parliament very rarely concerns itself with matters relating to tourism."
"Upon closer examination, the work of the Committee on Transport and Tourism can be seen to consist of matters relating to transport 95% of the time, and those relating to tourism only 5% of the time."
"Although I wholeheartedly endorse Mr Simpson's report, I have one request: if we wish to discuss statistics, it is very important to compare things which are comparable."
"The next stage of our work should be to adopt standards in individual areas, for example, in the case of hotels."
"If a hotel has two, three or four stars, this must be very clearly formulated."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, can I say to Mr Simpson that the number of speakers on a very technical report shows what important work he has been doing and how important this is."
"Despite being technical, we certainly needed to revise this regulation, which is very important."
"It will also be possible to put up a robust, analytical framework so that we are capable of making informed policy decisions regarding all the aspects of tourism that have been mentioned here today and many more besides."
"As tourism develops, we must also, of course, catch up with the statistics."
"The three institutions have together made a proposal that balances the need to have information, on the one hand, but also to respect the burden on respondents, on the other."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Simpson on the report and thank Parliament for this debate."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I listened with interest to what the Members said."
"I particularly want to take up the point that was raised about the fact that, while it is a Transport and Tourism Committee, only about five per cent of our workload concerns the tourism sector."
"This is true in some respects, but it is not because this Parliament does not want to do more work on the tourism sector: it is because the Council and the Member States will not let us do any more work on the tourism sector."
"So if there is blame to be laid in that regard, it should be laid fairly and squarely at the door of the Council."
"With this report, we have a framework that will give us the data required to help practitioners - those at the coalface - plan and develop our tourism product here in the European Union."
"We have a very diverse tourism industry - from beautiful natural areas to sunshine beaches to our rich industrial and cultural heritage - and Members know how much industrial heritage is close to my heart."
"Europe has a lot to offer visitors, be they from outside or from inside the European Union."
"I think that, by getting this report together, it gives us the opportunity to plan to provide a fantastic product for people to come and see and enjoy during their leisure time."
"I thank all the colleagues and the Commission for their hard work and their kind words."
"Such cooperation makes the life of a rapporteur a lot easier."
"I am not sure about it being exquisite: this is not a word usually associated with me, but I will accept it."
"I can give you an assurance that, as Chair of the Transport and Tourism Committee, I look forward to a very successful conclusion to this matter."
"(DE) Mr President, I am not certain under which Rule I should now take the floor."
"In an earlier debate, I complained about the fact that the Council is not present."
"However, we should not only complain, but also speak out if something is good."
"I simply wanted to point to the way that the Commissioner has acted today and the fact that her speeches have been brief, succinct and competent in terms of content - many of her colleagues would do well to follow her example of how to behave here in this House."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 6 April 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Tourism is an important economic activity of the Union, with great potential for contributing to the creation of jobs and economic growth."
"With about 1.8 million small and medium-sized enterprises, the estimated contribution of the tourism industry to European GDP in the EU is more than 5%."
"The system of tourism statistics is currently regulated by Directive 95/57/EC on the collection of statistical data in this sector."
"I believe that statistics are not only helpful for monitoring specific policies for tourism, but may be useful in the broader context of regional policy and sustainable development."
"In recent decades, the sector has been facing major challenges such as increasing global competition, demographic trends, environmental constraints, the seasonal distribution of tourist movements and the increasingly frequent use of new information and communication technologies by customers."
"In acknowledging the crucial role of statistics in the development of more effective tourism policies at European, national, regional and local level, I believe that the overall objective should be to strengthen the EU tourism sector through action coordinated at Union level to complement the efforts of individual Member States"
"European tourism has recently experienced a difficult economic situation, and this was aggravated by the eruption of the volcano in Iceland last year, because the interruption of air traffic due to the presence of volcanic ash clouds had a major effect on travel in Europe, causing significant disruption to airlines, travel agencies and tour operators as well as tourists themselves."
"It is therefore very important to improve and define a new policy framework for tourism in Europe."
"Furthermore, this sector is facing increasing difficulties and new challenges, such as competition, demographic trends, climate change and environmental constraints, and the seasonal distribution of tourist movements, which need to be addressed at both European Union and Member State levels."
"It is important to draw attention to the fact that tourism is a major economic activity with a broadly positive impact on economic growth and employment in Europe."
"Consequently, it is necessary to update and optimise the legal framework for European statistics on tourism, and we should strengthen the EU tourism sector through specific proposals and initiatives that would complement Member State programmes."
"Tourism is also an increasingly important aspect in the lives of European citizens, more and more of whom are travelling, either for leisure or business."
"Furthermore, this sector impinges on cultural and natural heritage and on traditions and contemporary cultures in the European Union."
"Consequently, it is important to define a new framework for action to increase its competitiveness and its capacity for sustainable growth."
"in writing. - It is appropriate that we will vote on a report on tourism on 6 April, which is known as Tartan Day."
"Tartan Day is a day of celebration where Scotland reaches out to our diaspora in North America and encourages our North American friends to come and visit us."
"It falls on the anniversary of the signing of Scotland's independence declaration, the Declaration of Arbroath."
"That centuries-old document sums up well the principles upon which all my work here is guided: 'It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom - for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself'."
"There is ever-growing talk at the moment about increasing the EU's global competitiveness; tourism is one of the most important socio-economic activities, generating approximately 5% of the European Union's GDP."
"To ensure the development of a sustainable, responsible, high quality tourism sector, it is absolutely necessary to update and improve the legal framework for European statistics in this area."
"If we improve the quality of statistical reporting, based on reliable, comparative data, we will benefit from a solid foundation when it comes to making decisions on devising EU financial policies and instruments."
"I think that we must do our utmost to remain the number one tourist destination in the world."
"To achieve this, we need to make maximum use of every possible funding option."
"In this regard, I call on the European executive to develop and mobilise instruments and programmes providing EU support which are specially tailored to the development of tourism in Europe, in keeping with the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I believe that the current system for collecting tourism statistics is not consistent with the new requirements we face, or with the rapidly developing tourist services market or the fact that tourists' habits are changing."
"It is therefore right that the report should take into account features such as short breaks or the use of the Internet to book trips."
"The updating and optimisation of the legal framework for the collection of statistical data in the field of tourism in the EU is extremely important in this respect."
"Tourism statistics and social and economic indicators illustrate the influence of tourism on the current state of the European economy."
"It is also vital to propose the insertion of a provision imposing an obligation to collect data regarding the accessibility of the tourist infrastructure to persons with reduced mobility."
"As Vice-Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would like to highlight the significance of the tourism sector for Europe's economic, social and cultural development."
"European statistics in this field, together with concern for environmental protection, can play a key role in planning a European strategy in this area."
"Reliable data which have been properly processed are essential in order to plan a framework of action in such a way as to maximise profit and to manage environmental threats."
"I believe that one of the matters we focus upon should be the collection of data on the development and current state of agritourism and ecotourism."
"A pan-European exchange of best practices is also essential for the dynamic development of this unique sector."
"In order to meet our expectations, European decision makers and entrepreneurs need up-to-date and reliable data, which take technological changes and new trends in consumer behaviour into account."
"It should be noted that the Treaty of Lisbon assigned new powers to the European Parliament with a view to stimulating measures in this field, as a result of which Parliament has a say in the revision of legal standards regulating this sector."
"I hope that this will help ensure that work on a sustainable tourism strategy progresses constructively."
"With the Treaty of Lisbon, tourism has become a Community responsibility in its own right, and we must therefore take control of this matter."
"This proposal for a regulation enables us to update tools to improve the visibility and strengthen the appeal of Europe as a tourist destination of excellence."
"By developing tourism, whether for business or pleasure, we are helping to revive and support growth and to create employment."
"We will thus have reliable and effective databases, for use by the public authorities and professionals in the sector, which will enable us to adapt tourist services to tourists' expectations, at a time when consumption patterns have changed and evolved and when competition is becoming ever stronger in this economically attractive, job-creating industry."
"This will give us precise and valuable information for the discussions we will have and for the guidelines we will set on European tourism policy."
"For these reasons, I supported this proposal. Thank you."
"EU policy framework to fight violence against women (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Svensson, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the proposal for a new EU policy framework to fight violence against women."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the shadow rapporteurs and my colleagues in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality for their strong commitment to fighting violence against women."
"Ahead of the vote tomorrow, and in order to initiate the debate, I could have mentioned the number of women affected and how many women have been murdered as a result of this deadly violence."
"I am not going to do that, but I will try to convey a few images of this violence ahead of the vote, so that all Members know that they have an opportunity to fight this violence right now by voting yes to the report tomorrow."
"Imagine a mother sitting with her children and reading them a good-night story."
"Suddenly, the door is jerked open and her husband, the children's father, is standing in the doorway."
"Both she and the children know immediately what is going to happen."
"The children draw the covers over their heads, putting their fingers in their ears and closing their eyes, trying to shut out what they know will happen."
"They hear their father shouting, they hear him kicking and striking their mother and they hear their mother's groans."
"That is one picture of this violence."
"Here is another picture."
"A woman who has lived for a number of years with threats, insults and abuse finally decides to leave the relationship to build a new life for herself and her children."
"She flees and is lucky to find sheltered accommodation."
"After a few days, she leaves her children at the day nursery."
"The man is waiting outside and stabs the woman with a knife - she dies."
"Yet another victim of the deadly violence that affects women."
"This is a type of violence that is inflicted on women precisely because we are women."
"The lethal violence against women illustrated by that last image occurs when the woman has finally decided to leave the relationship."
"The most dangerous thing a woman can do is to ask for a divorce from a man who believes that he owns her."
"She is in a very dangerous situation when the man realises that he is about to lose control and power over her."
"Here are some more images."
"A young girl is on her way home after a trip to the cinema."
"She says goodbye to her friend and calls out 'See you tomorrow'."
"She still has a little way to go."
"She hears heavy steps behind her, but only has time to register the fact that someone is following her."
"She is attacked and raped."
"She survives, but has to live with this for the rest of her life."
"Other problems that we have to face include genital mutilation."
"In its action plan implementing the Stockholm Programme, the Commission stated that during the period 2011-2012 it will issue a communication on this violence and that the communication is to be followed up by an EU action plan."
"I welcome this and look forward to this action plan."
"As long as women are affected by gender-based violence - just because we are women - we will not be able to call our society an equal society."
"Women's lives and their various life choices are restricted by this violence and by the awareness of how widespread it is in society."
"Women are victims of gender-based violence, but I would also like to finish by saying that sometimes, we have to stop viewing these women simply as victims."
"These are often strong women who, with well-functioning social support, manage to build a good life for themselves and for their children."
"It is now up to us in the European Parliament to show that we support these women."
"Member of the Commission. - Thank you very much, Mrs Svensson, for your very moving introduction on this extremely important subject."
"Combating violence against women is a very high priority for the Commission, as is shown by the gender equality strategy."
"There is still, as you show, a very big problem of violence against women in Europe, and for that reason, we are working on focused actions to address this issue."
"We will develop a clear and coherent policy response to tackle this problem in Europe."
"I welcome your report, Mrs Svensson, and I welcome this important initiative; it provides the possibility to cooperate, exchange views and create synergies between what the Commission is doing and what the European Parliament is doing in order to define future action in this area."
"A number of points that you raise in the report are actually covered by ongoing and planned actions of the Commission on combating violence against women."
"To maximise our impact, we are focusing on concrete actions in an area where we have a clear legal basis to act in the Lisbon Treaty."
"In the forthcoming victims' rights package, we will, notably, address the protection of particularly vulnerable victims such as women, but also children."
"This package will be presented next month."
"Every victim of crime needs assistance in the aftermath of a crime and to cope with any proceedings that follow."
"Women are, of course, particularly vulnerable if they have suffered violence in their home - rape or sexual abuse, stalking or other kinds of gender-based violence."
"They need to be treated with respect and knowledge when they come into contact with people and the justice system."
"These women also need specialised support and protection and should be given access to justice and compensation."
"The current legal framework in the EU does not provide for a minimum level of treatment for victims throughout the EU irrespective of where they have been victimised, and that is why the Commission intends to act to strengthen the position of victims in Europe."
"We are thus presenting, as a first step, a package of legislative measures on the rights, protection and support of victims of crime and the mutual recognition of protection measures."
"Specific focus in this will be given to vulnerable victims such as victims of sexual and domestic violence."
"The Commission will also provide for the mutual recognition of protection measures, which will benefit especially victims suffering repeated violence from a spouse, partner or member of their close family."
"With this package, the Commission will make sure that in Europe, no woman crossing the borders and benefiting from a protection measure - be it of an administrative, civil or criminal nature - is left behind."
"Our package will set out a general framework, which would then be completed in the course of this mandate by other instruments focusing on the specific needs of certain types of victims."
"For instance, the Commission is concerning taking stronger action to combat female genital mutilation, as you also mention in your report."
"In parallel with our actions in the criminal justice area, we will work for the empowerment of women, awareness-raising and the collection and analysis of statistics on violence against women."
"The Commission will draw on the work by the European Institute for Gender Equality, which will collect and analyse data and statistics on this subject."
"To conclude, I would like to underline that the Commission is currently providing important financial support to prevent and combat violence against women, particularly through the DAPHNE III Programme, the work of European NGOs and public authorities."
"Mr President, on most occasions that I have spoken in Parliament, it has been to denounce violence against women, and I am here again to combat it."
"I must say that not only do I not tire of doing this, but I think that it is essential to continue to speak out in public about this violation of human rights, as you cannot defend a cause without a sounding board."
"Furthermore, this Parliament is the best loudspeaker available to me to defend all those women who suffer daily from abuse and who need us, as legislators, to compel the Member States to punish the perpetrators of this aggression in a manner that befits the seriousness of the crime, and also to provide assistance to the victims."
"When, according to estimates, one in four women in Europe has suffered gender violence at least once in her life, and the same proportion of children, I believe that we cannot but demand greater commitment, as has been recognised by the Commission in its action plan."
"I believe that we must keep on insisting, time and time again, in order to protect victims, as we did with the European Protection Order, for which I was rapporteur, and I hope that it will come into effect as soon as possible."
"This report has benefited from a great measure of consensus and support from the outset."
"This shows that when we tackle domestic violence, which affects all family members, including children, the elderly, women and men, this should not provide the opportunity for political opportunism, as it does us all great credit to be making progress towards finding a solution to this scourge of our society."
"The first thing we must do is to speak up, and the second is to get down to work, for, although we have spent decades speaking about gender violence, we have not managed to reduce the number of deaths."
"We must be doing something wrong, and therefore, it is time to leave demagogy aside and to move from words to actions."
"We must give more genuine assistance and apply the legislation that women need if they are to live in dignity and safety."
"I want all the victims to know that I shall always be here to speak up for them, until the day that, by working together, we manage to defeat this terrible enemy, which sadly ends the lives of so many innocent victims."
"What I say is: we have had enough."
"It cannot go on."
"I ask all of you to say likewise."
"Mr President, one in four European women are victims of violence."
"More than one in 10 women are victims of sexual attacks, and our children also suffer violence."
"Twenty six percent of children report having suffered physical violence during their childhood."
"These figures show that Europe has a serious problem that requires action."
"We can no longer turn a blind eye to this, and I simply cannot bear to hear any more stories of women who have had acid thrown in their faces by their husbands or boyfriends, or of women who are disfigured and mutilated."
"I have heard the most heart-rending stories from many women, and every one of these stories is also a shameful blot on the EU's history."
"The EU needs to act now and stop this violence."
"That is why this report on violence against women that we are debating today is so important."
"We are sending a signal to the outside world that the European Parliament considers gender-related violence to be a violation of fundamental human rights."
"Therefore, the Commission must respond now."
"We need a directive, we want a directive that will stop violence against women."
"Putting a stop to violence will require a coordinated and multi-faceted effort."
"We need to secure the safety of the victims and provide them with the best possible protection, while also ensuring that there is nowhere in Europe where it is possible to avoid punishment for being violent towards women, and, most important of all, we must, of course, make a huge effort with regard to prevention."
"Violence is not a private matter."
"We can only end this violence by taking action from a political standpoint."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Thank you Mr President."
"Let me first thank the rapporteur for the great work accomplished and all my colleagues for their determination not to give up fighting gender-based violence."
"This report shows that the European Parliament considers that immediate action to combat violence against women is not only necessary but urgently needed."
"The Commission must acknowledge that all arguments point to the fact that EU-wide measures and instruments have to be introduced."
"We know that, throughout the Union, huge discrepancies exist in Member States' legislation to combat violence against women."
"Last year, a feasibility study by the Directorate-General for Justice found differences in access to protection orders, the availability of support services and the expertise and capacity of the responsible public servants."
"We have seen signs of commitment towards the eradication of all forms of violence and an efficient policy framework at EU level, notably within the Women's Charter which you presented last year, and the communication on the implementation of the Stockholm Programme."
"Nevertheless, many Member States have failed in implementing efficient legislation to protect women from all forms of violence and discrimination, and we are now seeing that the core values of our Union do not apply to half its citizens."
"Therefore, we now call on the Commission to come up with a dedicated legislative proposal."
"A set of minimum requirements must be drawn up and incorporated into a legislative act which should be part of a comprehensive strategy addressing all forms of gender-based violence."
"This strategy and policy initiative should also be complemented by broad awareness-raising activities."
"I am thinking, in particular, about a European year on combating all forms of violence against women, for which we are currently collecting citizens' signatures."
"Finally, having regained our founding principles laid down in the Treaty, and the commitment from your side which has already been stated, we expect today a clear answer on how and when the Commission intends to propose effective measures at EU level."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I am happy that combating gender-based violence is a priority of both the European Commission and the European Parliament."
"That gives us a common goal to make real progress in the coming years."
"I hope this report will be considered an important contribution to the victims' package that the Commission has promised us, and that the victims' package will, in turn, be one of the aspects of a Europe-wide comprehensive strategy that includes victim support, but also other aspects of the struggle against violence."
"For instance, we need a minimum level of assistance services."
"Every woman should have access to shelters, to free legal aid and to psychological aid."
"For example, we need to protect migrant women who do not have an independent residence permit and are extra vulnerable."
"This report includes many important aspects and we, as Greens, hope that we can vote in favour of it."
"But if recital J and paragraph 19 stay in, which call prostitution a violation of human rights without even distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary prostitution, we will have to abstain."
"I hope it does not go that far and that we can have a strong and widely-supported report to offer to the Commission and to the Member States as our contribution."
"Mr President, I welcome this own-initiative report of the European Parliament, and I take the view that Member States must introduce the laws which are essential for stopping violence against women."
"Domestic violence is a very serious form of violence against women."
"Domestic violence is not a private family matter."
"The European Conservatives and Reformists are committed to supporting the family and, above all, children."
"The problem of domestic violence is related to this."
"Domestic violence has disastrous consequences for all family members, particularly children."
"Children who repeatedly witness domestic violence often accept violence as a normal form of behaviour."
"There is a strong likelihood that they themselves will commit these acts in school or later on in life."
"Violence against women, in my opinion, also reflects and reinforces inequalities between men and women, and therefore often determines the position of women in society."
"Women who are exposed to domestic violence commonly become economically dependent and are exposed to psychological pressure from the perpetrator."
"We must pay due attention to domestic violence in order to bring it out into the open and help the victims, who are women and children."
"We must therefore raise awareness of the occurrence of this form of violence."
"We need to have a social debate on this issue, and we need to mount a prevention and awareness campaign, as women often do not like to speak openly about their traumatic experiences, out of fear for themselves and their children."
"In connection with this, I also support the introduction of the European Protection Order, which, among other things, may help victims of domestic violence at the European level, as long as it has a sound legal basis."
"Mr President, this is an important report that proposes a new global political approach against gender-based violence, with concrete measures including, in particular, criminal proceedings and preventive and protective action, drawing attention to the need to guarantee conditions for the emancipation of women, while also combating insecure work, unemployment and poverty, so that women can choose their lifestyles freely."
"Unfortunately, women are currently unable to make this choice and are often forced into situations of dependency, including prostitution and submission to acts of domestic violence that would otherwise be unacceptable to them."
"It is therefore time to move from words to actions in order to put an end to this violence, which is clearly one of the most serious forms of human rights violation."
"This gender-specific violence, which also has a strong negative impact on children, and tends to worsen during periods of economic and social crisis, can no longer be accepted."
"That is why we are calling on the Commission, as well as on the Member States, to take concrete measures as soon as possible in defence of women's rights and against violence."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, combating all forms of violence against women is a priority for the Hungarian Presidency of the European Union."
"I therefore call for long-term political, social and legal measures to do away with gender-based violence and to achieve true equality between the sexes."
"I have been sponsoring, along with other colleagues in this House, the establishment of a 'European year of combating violence against women' in order to raise awareness among European citizens."
"I believe that the European Commission's acknowledgement in the 2010-2015 Action Plan of the need to combat gender-based violence by all means is a significant step which must be translated into specific actions."
"We still await the strategic plan that the European Commission announced it would be presenting this year."
"This plan should introduce a package of legal measures and practices to ensure victims of violence are offered adequate protection by national criminal justice systems."
"In Europe, it is estimated that between 20 and 25% of women have suffered violence at least once in their lifetime."
"Moreover, it is estimated that half a million women living in Europe have undergone female genital mutilation."
"These statistics, which are unfortunately on the rise, are certainly alarming and worrying and require prompt action by European institutions."
"Violence against women has negative consequences on the entire family."
"Mothers can no longer instil a sense of security in their children and children become indirect victims of violence."
"Violence against women is a phenomenon that is very difficult to monitor, because often the women who are its victims are ashamed and are afraid to report the violence to the authorities."
"This makes the work of the institutions more difficult yet, at the same time, necessary."
"So I join my colleague, Mrs Jiménez-Becerril Barrio, in saying, 'stop violence against women, stop it immediately!'"
"(PT) Mr President, in my capacity as shadow rapporteur, I congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report, which deserves my group's support."
"It has already been said that violence against women represents a serious attack on human rights; a serious violation of human rights."
"We know that victims of violence are obliged to forego many of their fundamental rights, and that they are vulnerable to further abuse."
"Not long ago, I visited a shelter in my country, Portugal, and spoke to a number of these women."
"Some described a life of suffering, and it was only because their children put pressure on them that they had the courage to report their attackers."
"Others described how their children, now grown up, filed charges, because the women themselves did not have the courage to do so."
"It is unacceptable that they, the victims, should have to leave their homes, taking their children out of the family environment, while the aggressors remain at home."
"I believe that we need to change legislation so that women are respected and so that women do not continue to be victims of violence; victims of situations that have an adverse effect on all of us."
"I would also like to say that this is an attack on democracy itself, too, as these women are being deprived of their rights as citizens."
"Let us therefore combat this scourge together."
"(PL) Mr President, when discussing how to combat violence against women, we mainly think about violence within families or in personal relationships."
"It goes without saying that this type of violence constitutes a serious wrongdoing, and the Member States should take firm legal measures to fight it."
"I agree with the spirit of the Svensson report in this respect."
"However I would like to take the opportunity of this debate to highlight a different type of violence not infrequently experienced by women."
"I am talking about state-imposed violence, entailing removing children from their mothers, which is happening with increasing frequency."
"Taking away a child is the worst possible violence that can be inflicted on a mother, and this sometimes happens for entirely trivial reasons."
"I know of dramatic examples in Poland of children being taken away from their mothers, including one case in which a family court removed a 10 year-old boy from his mother because the mother was accused of praying too much."
"There are situations in which children are removed because the parents are poor."
"Instead of helping the family, the children are taken away to a foster family or taken into care."
"There are also dramatic cases in which children are taken from their mothers due to disputes between the parents."
"Dramatic scenes sometimes ensue when children are taken from their mothers by the police, social workers or court officials."
"The value of the family is depreciating in Europe, and the state is interfering more and more in family life."
"This not infrequently results in state-sanctioned violence which harms parents and which, above all, harms children."
"Taking children from their mothers, and taking mothers from their children - for there are two sides to the matter - should be a final resort for when the child is being abused or suffering violence."
"Children should not, under any circumstances, be taken away because of poverty."
"Families and women in families should be given comprehensive support, and we should avoid breaking family ties, because this is not infrequently a medicine worse than the malady."
"(PL) Mr President, I welcome the fact that the European Parliament will adopt a report during this part-session which sets out a multi-faceted approach to violence against women."
"I believe that employing such a broad definition of violence against women will help in the fight against this problem."
"There can be no doubt that tangible results will only be achieved if integrated measures are taken at various levels - political, social, legal and educational."
"Nevertheless, we are still waiting for a proposal for a directive which is focused exclusively on combating violence, and I hope that the European Commission will put forward a proposal of this kind in the near future."
"I would like to conclude with two more comments."
"It is of the utmost importance that violence against women should finally be perceived as wrongdoing, and not only from the perspective of the women themselves, or the social unit of the family, but also that we should be aware of the attendant costs which are borne by society as a whole, as is happening ever more frequently."
"Secondly, during our debate on this problem, we should not concentrate solely on combating violence, but also on the various dimensions of such behaviour."
"We should fight stereotypes and condemn social acceptance of violence against women, and try to change the way in which children are brought up so that future generations of young people believe in genuine equality between women and men and put it into practice."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Svensson on her report, which raises an extremely important and sensitive issue for society, namely, violence against women."
"I believe that today's words will be followed by actions, and that we will not only talk about violence against women but, above all, take action to defend women. Thank you very much."
"(NL) Mr President, in the Stockholm Programme, the Commission indicated that it would use all possible means to combat violence against women."
"There is, however, no comprehensive strategy at the moment, and yet we need to act urgently."
"Safety is an important commodity, especially for the most vulnerable amongst us."
"This also applies to a large group of women who are still subject to forced marriages, honour killings and genital mutilation."
"These harmful traditional practices affect many girls and women in Europe on a daily basis."
"We need adequate resources to tackle this kind of violence."
"To that end, we need investigations and we need to pay special attention to the victims of such practices."
"Therefore, the Commission needs to set up a European strategy as soon as possible in order to combat violence against women, a strategy which will address traditional harmful practices, in particular."
"Today, rather than tomorrow, and not just in 2012 or 2013."
"It is therefore unacceptable that an important instrument such as the European Protection Order has still not come about."
"Somebody's safety cannot and should not stop at the border."
"(PL) Mr President, following on from comments made by previous speakers and from the Svensson report itself, we should, first and foremost, emphasise once again that violence against women is still a feature of our society."
"One of the main reasons why this phenomenon has persisted is the inferior material status of women and economic discrimination against them during their career, more restricted access to the labour market, lower pay and fewer social security benefits."
"It is women who accept the consequences of motherhood and who bear the burden of bringing up children."
"Social security in this respect is insufficient in many European countries."
"During women's working lives and, in particular, when they have retired, these factors mean that they are reliant on the goodwill of their spouse and social security systems."
"This is a grossly unfair situation, and it must meet with universal opposition."
"This is why it is so important to propose that women be paid in full for the time they devote to motherhood and bringing up children."
"This is particularly important today, at a time of demographic crisis in Europe."
"Measures to ensure equal economic opportunities for women may help to eliminate or reduce violence against them."
"The economic dependence of women on men is one of the many reasons for women's passivity, submissiveness and also, in a certain sense, their consent to the phenomenon of violence."
"It is high time to put an end to this."
"The European Parliament has far-reaching opportunities to improve this situation, particularly in countries where women are in a particularly difficult situation due to widespread poverty."
"This is a very important message, and I am grateful to those who initiated this report for perceiving this problem and for actively taking measures to resolve it."
"(HU) Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for her report as I believe that it deals with a very important social problem."
"In Europe, we have become used to the fact that very often, things move when they have economic importance."
"I would like to emphasise, in particular, that the report points out that violence against women in Europe causes damage in the order of billions each year."
"Violence is present at all levels: among the poor, the rich, the poorly educated and those with university degrees alike."
"Moreover, it must also be said that every year, several hundred women are indeed victims of crime within the family."
"A form of violence which has no precedent has also appeared in Europe, as has already been mentioned here."
"Female genital mutilation and also honour killings are taking their toll in Europe."
"Obviously, we would like a European norm to be created to overcome violence against women."
"However, we know full well that this is almost impossible in the absence of a legal basis."
"Nevertheless, what can be done is to create a common European strategy."
"Even if we are unable to harmonise legal systems, clearly, exchanging good practices may be of significant help in this area."
"The report also points out that there are some violent acts which are not recognised as violent acts by certain legal systems."
"I believe that cooperation may bring some progress in the future, but what may make this cooperation effective is primarily a European strategy, which is very much needed. Thank you very much."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson."
"We know that violence against women and children is increasing across Europe."
"For this reason, we urge the Commission to submit a proposal, as it has already promised, for a strategy on violence against women by 2011."
"This should be all-inclusive, in the sense that it should cover domestic violence and genital mutilation, but also some more insidious forms."
"I am thinking of severe discrimination and bullying in the workplace against women who are pregnant or intend to marry and who are called on to resign beforehand, which is something that happens in my country but is no longer a crime as it was in the past."
"I am also thinking of what can only be described as the incitement to violence perpetrated by the media and advertising."
"After the directive on trafficking in human beings and the imminent directive on the victims of violence, announced by Commissioner Malmström, I think that the Treaty of Lisbon has laid the basis for achieving greater legal harmonisation in the way Member States acknowledge the importance of crimes of violence against women and children as specific forms of violence, as well as defining the essential standards of services for consulting, legal assistance and protection for women and children in cooperation with NGOs."
"It will also lead to consistent and comparable statistics with impact analyses of forms of prevention and enforcement by Member States to ensure a reduction in violence."
"I think, in this respect, that there is a common will by Parliament - I was one of the signatories to the written declaration - to define a year of reflection across Europe on the theme of violence, and I think that Parliament can add its very strong and very influential voice to this."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, violence against women is a serious violation of human rights, as we have all already asserted."
"It is an old and global problem, affecting countries that are culturally and geographically distinct; that are more- and less-developed."
"This situation is frequently associated with dysfunctional families; families in the most marginal social and economic strata."
"Nevertheless, in truth, it is a phenomenon that exists in many families, irrespective of their level of education, economic position or social standing."
"It is estimated that nearly a fifth of women in Europe have been the victim of acts of physical violence at least once during their adult lives."
"The priority is therefore to provide support for women who are victims of violence, and this report contains a set of initiatives with this aim: notable among these are legal assistance for victims, stronger and more effective criminal investigation, the important measure of creating refuges for victims and establishing an emergency number, and provision for deterrent penalties commensurate with the seriousness of the crime."
"The damage to the physical and mental health of women who are victims is incalculable, but society also bears high costs."
"Combating this phenomenon therefore requires political and social mobilisation."
"After all, this is a question of ensuring equality and development."
"For this reason, the organisation of a European year of combating violence against women is to be welcomed, as it will have the effect of raising awareness of this terrible scourge among the European public."
"(LT) Mr President, I would like to thank Eva-Britt Svensson for preparing an excellent report."
"The real violations of women's rights and violence against women highlighted by the rapporteur show once again that these truly are violations of a person's fundamental rights, which know no geographical, economic, cultural or social limits."
"According to the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme adopted last year, the Commission should, as a matter of urgency, draw up a strategy for combating violence against women, and I therefore call on the Commission to take concrete action as quickly as possible and to present such a strategy."
"Gender-based violence covers sexual abuse, human trafficking, forced marriage and genital mutilation, and such violent crimes have an extraordinary impact on and do irreparable damage to a woman's physical and mental health."
"I would therefore like to call on the Member States to ensure better training for healthcare providers, social workers, the police and judicial authorities, and well coordinated cooperation, to enable them to respond to all cases of violence against women in a professional manner."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Malmström, although she is no longer present, for the funding and support allocated to non-governmental organisations for combating violence against women, and would also like to recall that during the economic and financial crisis, instances of violence are even more widespread."
"Consequently, we cannot reduce funding in this area."
"(SK) Mr President, although we have been drawing attention to violence against women and the violation of their rights for several decades, it has not proven possible to stop this reprehensible form of criminal activity."
"The various forms of violence against women damage not only the women themselves, but also their families."
"Family life often loses its meaning, which is to provide a sense of safety and security."
"Children who encounter violence at home are, in a sense, also its victims."
"We must therefore pay attention at the European level to the possible exposure of women and children to domestic violence."
"In the case of older women or women who are physically or mentally weaker, the problem of self-defence and the protection of their own interests is even more complicated."
"Women are also exposed to gender-based abuse through various forms of violation of personal freedoms, since human trafficking for sexual purposes in particular, for example, is one of the most serious problems affecting all of society."
"It is vital, therefore, to press for more effective criminal prosecutions, and to ensure that the subsequent punishments reflect the seriousness of the crime."
"It is essential to take steps to prevent these serious violations of human rights and freedoms, and to guarantee European women a dignified life."
"(GA) Mr President, I would like to focus on two points: violence against women and the role of men as workers in hotels."
"The figure of 25% of women having suffered violence is totally unacceptable."
"I think it suggests the need for an educational programme amongst young males, in particular, in anger management and respect for females, so that the idea of raising your hand to a female would be absolutely taboo and not the norm, as is often presented in films, in some cultures and, sadly it seems, in some homes."
"The second point I want to mention is the role of men as workers in hotels."
"The reason I say that is that there was a friend of mine, a beautiful young girl, Michaela Harte, killed in Mauritius on her honeymoon when she walked in on workers in the hotel who were robbing her room."
"If it were the other way around, and a male walked in on females, the chances of their being killed would be far less."
"There is a need to look at that risk and probability."
"The whole question of males and their access to rooms, especially female's rooms, has to be looked at."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the report by our Chair, Mrs Svensson, which highlights the need to view all forms of violence as crimes amenable to criminal law."
"As a general rule, I particularly appreciate the fact that the European Union is composed of States with diverse and varied national cultures and traditions, but when it comes to violence, I am appalled to see the differences in treatment that exist."
"Let us take one example: rape."
"Although it is amenable to criminal law everywhere, it is not defined in the same way in all the Member States."
"As far as Latvia is concerned, marital rape simply does not exist."
"In Malta, the rape of a man by another man does not exist."
"In Slovakia, to be raped with an object is not considered rape."
"Hence, there are women, men and children with shattered lives lying behind all of these definitions."
"To trivialise the definition of crimes is to trivialise the victims themselves, and their suffering."
"I therefore call on the Commission urgently to develop an effective road map against all forms of violence."
"(DE) Mr President, it has been very clear in the debate that violence against women is not a trivial offence; it is quite clearly a violation of human rights."
"It has already been said that even children are sometimes indirect victims of violence against women."
"They can even be direct victims of violence against women, because the main cause of still births and miscarriages is certainly the effects of violence against women."
"It is not only a question of domestic violence; there is also forced prostitution, honour killings - where there can actually be no question of honour - human trafficking, genital mutilation and much more besides."
"The trigger for this report, for which I am very grateful to Mrs Svensson, was, in this case, not only the fact that it was noticed in the context of the report on equality that equality is also put at serious risk as a result of violence against women, but also the fact that, through the Treaty of Lisbon, we now have the opportunity to enact a directive and to establish a common legal framework in Europe."
"That is urgently needed for us to make significant progress here, because this is a cross-border European problem that we must combat."
"(DE) Mr President, violence against women takes many forms, and it remains an international problem with which the international community has still not managed to get to grips."
"The use of violence compromises the health, dignity, security and autonomy of its victims."
"As a consequence, the women concerned are restricted in their opportunities to participate in social life and work."
"Moreover, we just need to consider the costs to see that violence against women is also a social problem, for example, in areas of health and justice."
"Women are at most risk within their own four walls."
"The commonest cause of injuries in women is domestic violence."
"Violence against women, whatever form it takes, is not a trivial offence."
"The EU must also sign the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women."
"(SK) Mr President, the exposure of an individual to any form of violence has far-reaching destructive consequences for the family and society, and particularly merits condemnation when committed against women and children."
"However, I consider it alarming that domestic violence is identified as the main cause of miscarriages or stillbirths, and I am therefore pressing for all the available resources of criminal law to be applied to the effective suppression and prevention of physical violence."
"I would like to draw attention to the urgent need to protect women, and especially poor women, from so-called surrogate motherhood."
"Under the pretext of solidarity, surrogate motherhood exposes women to physical exploitation and even abuse, in direct conflict with the ban on trafficking in human bodies and body parts."
"A woman's dignity, intimacy and body are degraded in this way, and they become the subject of corrupt rental agreements on the international human trafficking market."
"(RO) Mr President, although violent acts against women are the most prevalent in the world, they are still the least likely to be punished, whether committed in conflict zones or democratic countries."
"There are regions around the world where violence against women assumes every form: rape, sex trafficking, forced marriages, death, abductions for religious or criminal reasons, forced prostitution, not to mention violence within the family or from former partners."
"In addition, the age of girls being subjected to violence is steadily falling."
"I think that Member States should make additional efforts at EU level to provide comprehensive national statistics which will cover, to a greater extent, gender-based violence, as well as to improve the collection of data on this issue, with the aim of finding the most suitable solutions for punishing the culprits."
"I also regard as useful the proposal for establishing an observatory on violence against women as part of the European Institute for Gender Equality, in close collaboration with the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"(RO) Mr President, as shadow rapporteur, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for this report and I will only raise two issues."
"I believe that it is time for us to go beyond the superficial approach to this issue because the lack of statistics, the lack of any consistent regulations on criminalising this issue in Member States, and the lack of concern for this matter, apart from general statements being made, confirm that this is indeed a subject which is handled superficially in the European Union."
"This is why a directive is necessary."
"The economic costs have not been analysed in any great depth, unfortunately neither in this report nor in other documents on the subject."
"This is because this issue, which is currently exacerbated by the economic crisis, incurs quite considerable financial costs for national budgets, amounting to hundreds of millions of euro."
"I believe that it is time for us to quantify these costs and attempt to respond to this situation using not only financial means, but also suitable legal instruments for tackling this problem."
"(HU) Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work."
"I am proud of the fact that in Hungary, it was I who wrote the first two books on the phenomenon of violence against women about 15 years ago."
"I am less proud that next to nothing has happened in this area since then."
"It is a fact that there is no, and neither can there be any, single EU regulation, but a lot of European taxpayers' money goes on prevention and care programmes."
"I would like to address a question mainly to the Commissioner about how the appropriate spending of these funds is checked."
"I have a suggestion: instead of asking the governments, ask the abused women concerned: for example, women who have been abused and taken refuge in shelters for women should be asked about the help they have received and the attitude of authorities to their cases in general, or girls and women suffering on the streets of Budapest or, say, Amsterdam, and who are hoping to escape from the hell of prostitution, should be asked about the type of help they have received from their state or government."
"(RO) Mr President, as is also clearly indicated in the report, the efforts to reduce violence against women must be supported on two fronts: at Member State level and through measures and programmes managed directly by the European Commission."
"I think that it is of paramount importance to continue the Daphne Programme and to encourage the participation of Member States which are faced with a rise in this form of violence in the current difficult economic circumstances."
"Nowadays, many people are facing psychological problems which sometimes trigger violence."
"It is vital to provide training to staff working for the European Union's police authorities as a basis for ensuring that investigations are carried out properly, with a good understanding of the issue and of the impact violence has on women."
"This aspect is also supported as part of the Stockholm Programme."
"Finally, the political effort must be backed up with financial support, and the Daphne Programme can provide a suitable framework for this."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, when it comes to equality issues, the European Union was, and is, at the forefront; it is also at the forefront in the fight against violence against women."
"In addition to the horrific nature of the matter, violence against women is also expensive."
"The report states that the annual cost of this violence is EUR 33 billion."
"That should take the wind out of the sails of those who say that the catalogue of measures that has now been established will clearly have a cost, too."
"This catalogue of measures is necessary, however."
"Training of police officers, judges, medical personnel - all of this is contained in the report, and I would also like to duly thank the rapporteur for that."
"However, I do see one small fly in the ointment and I would like to highlight this."
"Particular attention should also be paid to violence in the workplace."
"It is important to provide more specific wording on this issue, too."
"(CS) Mr President, when we see examples in the media of maimed women and children, we always ask ourselves how those around them could have remained ignorant of it for so long."
"It is therefore necessary that the proposed strategy of the Commission for combating domestic violence includes specific diagnostic mechanisms that are mandatory for health facilities and also for social workers, making it possible to provide genuinely rapid assistance to the victims."
"Violence motivated through religious rituals must be severely punished, and this, together with a culture of awareness that includes training for judges, will lead to zero tolerance in society of violence against women, including the mutilation of female organs."
"The strategy should also consider a free legal service and social assistance for victims of violence."
"I would like to thank Mrs Svensson for a highly detailed report, but I will vote against part of recital J, because it promotes the right of women to kill their foetuses, and I do not agree with that."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank the honourable Members for this very important debate on a subject that is obviously dear to many of us."
"Again, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her important report, and also the shadow rapporteurs."
"As I outlined in my introduction, we are planning several measures on this."
"The victims' rights package is, of course, extremely important and will come next month."
"We also have the general equality policy for prevention programmes, awareness-raising and so on. We are also following very closely the finalisation, right now, of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, in order - when it is ready - to propose to the Council that the European Union adhere to it, which would then make it legally binding in the areas where the European Union has competence."
"I would also like to mention two other proposals that you have adopted: the directive on combating trafficking, for instance, contains a lot of preventive measures but also support for victims, for women and children who are victims of trafficking for sexual and other purposes."
"Also in the different parts of the asylum package, special notice is taken of vulnerable people in asylum procedures, such as women who have been victims of sexual violence, etc."
"The problem is, as you have all outlined, enormous, and it is a shame that women and girls in our European Union are afraid on a daily basis."
"They are afraid of violence, rape and sexual abuse, and often from the people they love the most, whom they should be able to trust the most - husbands, partners, etc. We need to act, and we need to act where we can see concrete results."
"This is surely one of the most horrendous violations of human rights."
"I would like to congratulate those very few but still brave men who have contributed to this debate, because violence against women is not a women's issue: it is a human rights issue."
"We can only achieve results here if we work together, men and women, to combat this horrendous phenomenon."
"We need to work together: we need to achieve a Europe where women and girls do not have to fear violence just because they belong to the so-called 'wrong sex'."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking my fellow Members for their very wise words during the debate and, above all, for the resolve that I can see that all my fellow Members have to fight this violence."
"To the Commission, I would like to say that we look forward to the victims of crime package to provide further support for victims, but we also need a directive to combat this violence."
"It is not necessary to agree with every word in this report, but it is important to vote in favour of it in order to send a strong signal to the Commission that we need a directive."
"It is important to show all of these women who live in abusive relationships that they should not feel ashamed or guilty."
"By voting 'yes' to the report, we will show that the guilt is a crime that is committed against them."
"They must not feel guilt or shame."
"Finally, I would like to say that there are many of us women who have survived as a result of the efforts of society and through the work of shelters for women and women's organisations."
"It is now high time that these people and organisations did not have to shoulder the responsibility alone for helping women out of the situation that many of them are living in."
"What is important is that we break the silence and that we show that there is support for these vulnerable people."
"I would also like to emphasise how important it is to show that this is a problem that cuts across all social groups."
"There are no particular groups that are affected; it is found throughout society."
"I appeal to my fellow Members to send out the signal that it is no longer acceptable for women to have to live under these conditions."
"Women can establish a good life for themselves and their children, but to do so they also need support from us as elected representatives."
"My thanks once again to all Members for your strong resolve."
"Together, we will succeed in this fight."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 5 April 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - I wish to express support for this report and its recommendations."
"Research shows that the situation in my own state of Ireland mirrors the problem experienced across Europe."
"In 2005, the National Crime Council found that one in seven women in Ireland have experienced severe abusive behaviour of a physical, sexual or emotional nature from their partner."
"In 2009, I became the first ambassador of Rape Crisis North East based in the town of Dundalk."
"This support and counselling service is one of many across the east of Ireland offering vital support for victims of sexual and domestic violence, yet it has to cope with a very difficult funding environment."
"What is important is that the EU directs funding for research across Member States to ensure we have a full and accurate picture of the scope of the problem."
"But there also needs to be support for NGOs and Member State governments to raise awareness about the impact and effects of sexual violence, be it domestic, rape or human trafficking for sexual exploitation."
"Almost a quarter of women in Europe have suffered acts of physical violence at least once and more than a tenth have been subjected to sexual violence."
"As a result of its social consequences, the economic crisis has helped exacerbate the situation in circumstances where poverty and the lack of education are factors conducive to gender-based violence."
"This is why I think that coordinated measures are required against the causes of this problem, along with legislative harmonisation and closer judicial cooperation between Member States, with the aim of conducting investigations more efficiently."
"In order to put an end to violence against women, EU Member States and institutions have a duty to initiate as a matter of urgency some of the following actions: information and awareness-raising campaigns, setting up refuges for victims, setting up a single telephone number across the EU for immediate assistance and providing support for highly vulnerable groups of women such as immigrants and asylum seekers."
"in writing. - In 2008, when I was a member of the Latvian Parliament, I tabled a draft amendment to the Criminal Law of the Latvian Republic, toughening responsibility for domestic violence to women and children."
"Unfortunately, the amendment did not go through."
"At the meeting of the specialised commission, when the amendment was being discussed, members of the Latvian Parliament behaved cheerfully."
"As a result, cases of 'light' injuries of children and women in families remain unpunished."
"Cases are usually not investigated and sometimes the police refuse to accept applications from victims."
"The protection of women from domestic violence is not regulated by efficient instruments in the Latvian Republic."
"The Latvian authorities, the government, keep their eyes closed on obvious violations and are not going to put legislation in order."
"In the light of this report, I appeal to all members of the European Parliament to pay attention to lawless behaviour towards women that is occurring in Latvia."
"It can happen anywhere: on the street, on the underground, in someone's own home - women and children cannot feel 100% safe from attack anywhere."
"The deadening pseudo-morality found in society should give us pause for thought."
"The early stages of actual violence, such as intrusiveness, obscene remarks and harassment meted out by many migrants to western women on a daily basis are increasingly regarded as normal."
"The disregard for women has reached peak levels when a German judge refers to the husband's right of procreation as a decisive factor in her judgment in a Muslim divorce case."
"By permitting migration, the EU has imported problems from every country of the world, including honour killings, forced marriages and domestic violence in patriarchal family structures."
"Culture, religion and tradition must not be used to justify acts of violence."
"That is the only way to break the spiral of violence."
"The statistics provide no information on the extent to which the recorded increase in reported cases of domestic violence is related to the increased willingness of the victims to stand up for themselves or what proportion of these are immigrants."
"It is a fact in any case that a large number of migrants are registered in women's refuges."
"It is also a fact that we need to put a stop to the pseudo-do-gooder mentality that treats crimes committed with a religious or cultural motive with leniency."
"My commitment to the protection of the weak and women afflicted by violence compels me to vote in favour of legislation to guarantee the protection of victims of violence."
"Women, like children, are particularly fragile members of our society in some contexts."
"I therefore think it is important to ensure greater protection to women who claim they have suffered violence."
"I am thus in favour of free legal assistance to women who are victims of violence."
"I know there is a risk of inequality when men unjustly accused of violence have to pay court costs while their accusers receive legal aid: I have thought about this carefully."
"However, I believe that the number of cases of violence, including family violence, should lead us to take the side of those who suffer the most serious damage from lack of support: female victims of violence are statistically a much more dominant share than the few criminals who take advantage of the system to get the better of innocent men."
"It is difficult for battered women to file a complaint; free legal assistance would encourage the victims and help reduce the number of incidents that have gone unpunished."
"When we talk about violence against women, we often lack data, statistics and trends."
"What we need, above anything else, is to be able to measure this phenomenon at European level, in order to understand the scale of the problem."
"This will help us to better target needs and hence prevent cases of violence, help the victims and heal the wounds."
"We must remember the victims at all times."
"Whether we are talking about sexual abuse, the trafficking of women for prostitution, domestic violence or even violence with a cultural dimension - I am thinking here of genital mutilation and forced marriages - they are still serious crimes."
"We need to come up with a general European framework to protect women from this type of violence."
"We must stop being so nervous of the idea of making Europe the protector of women."
"We need a European legal framework within which to implement concrete measures such as the emergency telephone number, and training programmes for the police, the judiciary and teachers."
"The EU must offer solutions within Europe, but as a global player, it must also extend the scope of its action to outside its borders."
"Unfortunately, it has not been possible to stop violence against women in Europe and in the world as a whole, even though the European Union and the UN have stated that combating violence against women is a priority for them."
"It is true that there has been some progress and that people's awareness regarding this subject has increased somewhat, but the European Union's new political priorities are indispensable for combating violence against women more effectively and for achieving our common objective that women and children should not constantly live in fear of falling victim to violence."
"The Treaty of Lisbon also provides the legal competence for this."
"I consider it extremely important for the European Union to pay more attention in its legislation to violence which takes place between people in close relationships, because this is by no means a private matter."
"Unfortunately, victims all too often fear for their family's reputation and, justifiably, their safety and economic dependence, and so they do not go to the law enforcement authorities."
"We should therefore also direct particular attention to developing a victim support system and overturning taboos that exist in society - in other words, we should improve people's awareness."
"The help provided to victims must be genuine and guaranteed."
"One definite problem is a lack of shelters in Europe designed for women and children who have suffered violence, so the objective to build one shelter per 10 000 inhabitants for victims of crime is an entirely reasonable and necessary one."
"In order to ensure that protection for women fleeing violence and persecution is improved, even if they change their place of residence in Europe, it is important to implement the directive on protection orders."
"Violence against women takes various forms, from psychological repression and abuse to rape, sexual violence and the completely illegal and unacceptable ongoing trafficking and abuse of women by inhumane prostitution gangs."
"These gangs often dupe mainly young women and then force them to work as prostitutes."
"Many are driven to suicide in order to put an end to their nightmare."
"We need to examine more closely the countries which are the starting point for trafficking gangs, where traffickers buy silence and consent from government officials, turning these countries into havens for human rights abuses."
"These gangs could be combated through transnational cooperation between the EU, which is the destination, and these countries, which are the starting point for these illegal gangs."
"I call on the Commission to take action in this direction."
"Obviously, the organisations involved in women's rights seriously have their work cut out in this sector."
"This report represents the third contribution in recent months towards combating violence against women, following the European Protection Order and the directive on combating human trafficking."
"Violence against women is unquestionably a serious problem in all sections of society."
"The data in the report speaks of one woman in four experiencing physical violence in adulthood, with more than 10% of women becoming victims of sexual violence."
"These are alarming figures, behind which lie individual life stories."
"At the same time, only one in ten victims of violence seeks professional help."
"The reason for this is that most of them do not know how to deal with the situation."
"Violence against women has enormously destructive effects, not only on the women themselves, but also negative consequences for the people around them, and children in particular."
"I support the proposals leading to greater awareness and training for people who may come into contact with this form of violence in the course of their work."
"At the same time, it is also necessary to ensure better care and assistance for the victims."
"I also welcome the report because of the need to send a clear and strong message to society that violence will not be tolerated."
"Human rights and gender equality are among the EU's priorities."
"Since violence against women is a brutal violation of human rights and one of the main obstacles standing in the way of equality between women and men, the fight against this scourge should become our main objective."
"The approach taken to violence against women differs according to national legislation."
"Some Member States, for example, Spain, have well thought-out regulations in this area."
"Some do not have any at all."
"There are also significant differences in terms of the conviction rate for violence against women in the individual Member States."
"In view of the Member States' differing legal regulations and frequently limited influence in terms of enforcing the provisions of international law with regard to the fight against violence, the need for clear and binding regulations at EU level in respect of the problem is becoming ever more apparent."
"The various EU actions need to be summarised and presented in a single comprehensive strategy, the aim of which will be to combat violence against women throughout the EU."
"This strategy should be consistent with other international initiatives and be based on available EU programmes and best practices in the Member States."
"Work on a joint directive against violence should be completed within this parliamentary term."
"This is necessary in order to ensure that it can never be said again that even cows enjoy better protection in the European Union than women."
"We are all aware of violence against women, and we debate it, but when it comes to eliminating or doing away with it, the results are poor."
"Violence affects women at various times of life, from childhood to adulthood."
"It happens in school, at work, in peer groups, in public and also in private family life, or life with a partner."
"It takes many forms - from physical and sexual to mental and social, and even economic violence."
"It is experienced by women from different educational backgrounds, socio-economic positions, ethnic groups and religions, and by women from both urban and rural environments."
"It should be emphasised, however, that violence against women is a problem that we must all address."
"Eliminating it requires not only active institutions, but also active individuals - men and women - who do not turn a blind eye to this unpleasant phenomenon in our society, and who are willing to get involved personally in enforcing the principle of zero tolerance."
"The individual Member States must play a greater role in this, drawing up action plans for combating violence against women, boosting media awareness and adopting specific criminal laws and measures."
"in writing. - (PL) Unfortunately, despite all our efforts, violence against women, and violence in other areas of life, is still a major problem in Europe."
"Violent crimes are committed in all Member States, and they affect people from all social strata."
"This means that the fight against this problem and assistance for its victims must be multi-faceted."
"In order to prevent this kind of violence, it is important to support families and ensure their harmonious development."
"With regard to crimes involving violence against women, I believe it would be worth considering the introduction of a single European emergency telephone number, which could be called to obtain support or report a crime of this kind. The EU should aim to ensure that tougher punishments are meted out for violence against women, in particular, in the case of crimes involving sexual violence."
"Such crimes often remain etched in the minds of the women involved for many years, causing them to suffer and making it impossible for them to function normally."
"It is also imperative that better protection for the rights of victims in criminal proceedings be introduced at the same time."
"A key issue referred to in the report is the problem of prostitution and trafficking in women."
"In order to combat this practice effectively, what is needed is a pan-European agreement involving not only the EU Member States, but also countries outside the EU."
"Composition of Parliament: see Minutes"
"EU response to the migration flows in North Africa and the Southern Mediterranean, in particular, in Lampedusa - Migration flows arising from instability: scope and role of EU foreign policy (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the Commission statement on the EU response to the migration flows in North Africa and the Southern Mediterranean, in particular, in Lampedusa, and"
"the report by Fiorello Provera, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on migration flows arising from instability: scope and role of EU foreign policy:."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, some honourable Members may be getting tired of me but I think this joint debate on migration flows is very timely."
"This will be both a general discussion of the role and scope of EU foreign policy, as outlined in Mr Provera's report, and an opportunity for me to inform you about how the EU is responding to the crisis in the Southern Mediterranean."
"Let me start by thanking Mr Provera for his excellent report which I read with great interest."
"It is a very timely subject for discussion, as is the role that EU foreign policy should play with regard to the very complex and multi-faceted nature of migration."
"Let me start by outlining some elements of the EU response to the crisis in the Southern Mediterranean and then move to the more general role of EU foreign policy."
"As you all know, we are faced with a situation in the Southern Mediterranean that has become very critical in recent weeks with regard to the migration flows involved."
"More than 400 000 people have been displaced since the outbreak of the changes in Northern Africa and in Libya."
"Most of these people are third-country nationals who have come to Tunisia or to Egypt."
"A majority of them have been repatriated to their countries but a few thousand are still there and I will come back to them in a little while."
"Around 20 000 migrants, mainly from Tunisia and, to a lesser extent, from other African countries, have managed to enter the European Union irregularly, reaching the shores of Lampedusa and Malta."
"Both of these islands are therefore under strong migratory pressure."
"The European Union has already responded to these serious, but different, challenges in an effective and rapid manner, taking three concrete actions."
"Firstly, the Commission has mobilised EUR 30 million to manage the humanitarian emergency generated by the sudden inflows of migrants and refugees in the countries neighbouring Libya."
"With the assistance of funds provided on a bilateral basis by the Member States and other international donors, it has been possible to offer temporary shelter to migrants and refugees, to meet their basic needs, and to return them to their respective countries of origin."
"Secondly, we have reacted to the irregular and mixed flows across the Mediterranean Sea."
"Frontex, with the assistance of several Member States, launched Joint Operation Hermes, aimed at assisting Italy in controlling vessels that carry migrants and refugees."
"What is more, Europol has deployed a team of experts to Italy with the aim of helping the law enforcement authorities to identify possible criminal networks involved in trafficking."
"Thirdly, the Commission has tried to ensure that, in the very short term, the Member States exposed to the growing flows of refugees and irregular migrants could cope with the financial consequences of this displacement."
"We have rapidly identified EUR 25 million which could be mobilised under the External Borders Fund and European Refugee Fund if and when specific requests are made by the Member States."
"Only one request has been made so far, but we are ready to consider further urgent requests."
"I believe that this first response has been comprehensive; it is clear, however, that we need to do more."
"We need to set up a more structured, sustainable plan able to cover the various dimensions of this phenomenon, based on solidarity between Member States and in full respect of the European Union's international obligations."
"I have visited Egypt with the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Martonyi, and Tunisia with my colleague, Commissioner Füle, who is responsible for neighbourhood policy."
"This was partly in response to the conclusions of the European Council, which asked the Commission to liaise very actively with these two countries."
"In the run-up to our June JHA Council, I intend to propose a package of proposals to the Commission in May that will address the EU approach in the area of migration, mobility and security with the Southern Mediterranean countries."
"Several measures need to be taken in the short term."
"On the continuous and possible increase of flows of refugees coming from the Libyan territory, the following actions will be considered: an adequate level of funds needs to remain available to support the provision of humanitarian assistance."
"In this context, funds will have to be earmarked to meet the basic needs of the refugees, to facilitate their return to their countries of origin, when appropriate, and to support their successful social and professional reintegration back home."
"Moreover, an increasing number of refugees fleeing Libya are third-country nationals who were residing in Libya as refugees or asylum seekers."
"These people, a few thousand, cannot be returned to their countries of origin."
"Resettlement needs to be considered."
"The Commission is ready to facilitate this process and calls upon the Member States to take responsibility and to engage in such resettlement efforts."
"There will be financial support for this, from the European Refugee Fund in particular."
"In this context, it is imperative that the Council and the European Parliament make an effort to rapidly achieve an agreement on the European Resettlement Programme."
"All three institutions are in agreement on the political aim of this; we must find a way out of this institutional deadlock."
"It is also urgent to develop a regional protection programme encompassing Egypt, Libya and Tunisia."
"Under the thematic programme for cooperation with third countries, the Commission has plans to allocate EUR 3.6 million to support such a programme."
"The deployment of EASO teams to the Member States affected by these flows will also be considered, with a view to helping the authorities screen the asylum seekers."
"Finally, in the event of a massive influx of displaced persons and if the conditions foreseen in the directive are met, the Commission would be ready to consider making use of the mechanisms foreseen under the 2001 Temporary Protection Directive so as to provide immediate protection for these people on the territory of other EU Member States."
"The intention would be to give breathing space to the national asylum systems and to promote voluntary solidarity measures between Member States."
"With regard to the continuous inflows of irregular migrants coming from the Southern Mediterranean, which could increase, the Commission believes that Joint Operation Hermes, coordinated by Frontex, should receive additional resources from Member States."
"Frontex will stand ready to provide logistical and financial support to assist the Member States concerned, to organise return flights, and to deploy Rapid Border Intervention Teams if they wish."
"It is essential that the competences of Frontex are strengthened rapidly and more effective tools are put at its disposal."
"The amended regulation establishing the Frontex agency should be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament as soon as possible."
"Specific projects are also being prepared by EU services and will shortly be launched, in partnership with the countries concerned, starting with Tunisia and Egypt."
"The aim is to enhance their capacity to control their borders - in cooperation with the relevant authorities - to fight against criminal organisations promoting the smuggling of migrants and people trafficking, to facilitate readmission and social and professional reintegration, and to identify and register migrants entering the territory and treat them in accordance with international standards by offering asylum to those in need of international protection."
"These measures represent the immediate answer to the situation."
"However, we also need to implement long-term, sustainable programmes."
"With my partners in Tunisia and Egypt, we discussed bringing in working arrangements on a variety of issues covered under the Mobility Partnership."
"This could take the form of a new tailor-made EU approach, considering each country on its own merits, and taking into account the EU's overall foreign policy with a given country."
"Partnerships could cover everything from visa facilitation, under certain conditions and for specific categories, labour migration, preventing irregular migrant flows, setting up asylum systems, readmission, law enforcement, return, etc. We agreed with the two countries' interior ministers to set up a working arrangement and to start identifying what we can do together."
"I am convinced that this coherent EU foreign policy approach will help to set up a long-term system to address migration flows and this brings me to Mr Provera's report."
"Protracted, long-standing conflicts and humanitarian crises in regions, such as the one we are talking about, are important factors fuelling South-South migration and migration towards the EU."
"Our main global challenges, such as migration, fully underline the importance of developing a comprehensive approach linking security, stability, crisis management and development."
"As the report suggests, such an approach must be based on a strong human rights approach, notably with regard to migrants' rights."
"Special attention must be given to the situation of vulnerable groups."
"We share the view that it is crucial to put in place more long-term, sustainable cooperation programmes to address migration, mobility and security, in combination with the promotion of democracy, the rule of law and good governance with third countries."
"This approach should be tailor-made, as I have described, looking at each country on its individual merits."
"This comprehensive approach fits in with other policy processes such as the nexus between security and development, which is mentioned in both the European Security strategy and the European Consensus on Development."
"We have to mobilise the full range of policies and instruments at our disposal with regard to poverty eradication, early-warning systems and preventive diplomacy, humanitarian aid, crisis response actions, including sanctions, crisis management missions and post-conflict reconstruction and peace building."
"This report is therefore very timely, as the EU currently has to deal with a crisis."
"But it also represents a possibility to start something new, the possibility to support the fantastic new democratic forces that are emerging: there is a great willingness to reform countries, especially in Tunisia but also in Egypt."
"The Global Approach to Migration, as an external dimension of the EU's migration policy, is to be based on a genuine partnership with third countries."
"This is mentioned in the Stockholm Programme and the Stockholm Action Plan and we will provide further initiatives in the Global Approach to Migration presented this autumn."
"The aim is to define the objectives of the approach more clearly and in more strategic terms."
"It will propose priorities, principles and concrete measures but will also look more closely at the link between migration and development and between migration and climate change, for instance."
"I know that you are all willing to discuss different elements of this."
"It is a complex and very difficult issue which demands a great deal of time and effort to assess properly."
"It is also very event-driven and it changes almost by the hour."
"So far, the Commission has tried to be constructive and to address this in a very comprehensive and inclusive way."
"I look forward to taking your questions."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this tragically topical own-initiative report was first drawn up more than a year ago to assess the phenomenon of immigration and its structural causes in a pragmatic and balanced manner, regardless of political or ideological prejudices."
"We wanted to investigate the role of foreign policy and its ability to have an effect on the deep-seated causes of immigration, beyond humanitarian or emergency causes."
"Wars, ethnic tensions, persistent climate change, human rights violations, a lack of civil and economic liberties, endemic corruption, a lack of institutional representatives of citizens' needs, such as trade unions, associations, political parties: the set of all these elements represents the field of deployment of European foreign policy and resolving these problems will remove many of the reasons that cause millions of people to emigrate."
"No development cooperation policy can be fully effective without tackling the causes of instability in migrants' countries of origin."
"This involves regional cooperation with both with the country of origin and the country of transit, including through bilateral agreements."
"The Millennium Development Goals are already very ambitious, but certainly will not be achieved without political stability and without implementing effective mechanisms for preventing conflicts and maintaining peace."
"The global reach of this policy and its holistic approach require clear ideas and substantial financial resources that are difficult to come by in this moment of crisis."
"It is therefore advisable to coordinate the actions of the Union with those of other major powers such as the United States to avoid duplication of funding in the same areas or dispersal of financial resources, as has often happened in the past."
"A global phenomenon must be dealt with by a global policy."
"We must lead the migrants' countries of origin to democracy and good governance by making available our values and our experience."
"Under the European Neighbourhood Policy, we should offer an economic agenda that can increase levels of employment and trade agreements that can generate real economic development consistent with market laws."
"Commissioner Füle and the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, drew attention, with the slogan 'more for more', to the concept of conditionality of aid which aims to reward countries that are most actively setting out on the road to democratic reforms and respect for human rights."
"This is consistent with our European values, effective for development and - if you will allow me - morally fair to taxpayers."
"I would like to conclude by stating that a European policy for the management of large migration flows should go hand in hand with acceptance of the concept of 'burden sharing', in line with the duty of State solidarity under Article 80 of the Treaty, because no country can face up to an emergency of enormous proportions by itself."
"Finally, I thank Commissioner Malmström for her support for some or many points in this report, and I hope that Europe can actually work with Italy to address a phenomenon that has an international dimension and that affects every one of us."
"Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the productive cooperation I received while drafting this report."
"In relation to the particular subject we are debating today, the exodus of people from the Mediterranean region is not only a problem for the countries in this area, as the entire European Union has a responsibility to resolve this urgent humanitarian situation."
"This is a specific situation which we were not anticipating when this report was drafted."
"The view of the Committee on Development is that the priority must be to tackle the humanitarian situation and provide aid to the refugees."
"However, we cannot accept the extremely populist solutions suggested whereby the citizens of Lampedusa were promised that immigrants would be got rid of within 60 hours."
"Evacuations to the mainland region followed, but after the destination regions refused to accommodate the camps, repatriation got under way."
"I find it unacceptable that France and Germany have refused to take some of the refugees and that the Italian Minister for the Interior is threatening to grant temporary residence permits, which would allow thousands of immigrants to move around the European Union."
"These are not constructive and inclusive responses, in keeping with Member States' commitments."
"Neither selfishness nor forced solidarity feature among the values on which the European Union has been built."
"This is why I believe that we must insist as firmly as possible on dialogue and cooperation in order to identify common solutions to this serious problem."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - Madam President, migration is not only happening from everywhere else to Europe."
"In fact, most migration happens outside Europe, within countries or regions on other continents."
"Currently, Pakistan and Syria are the countries that are hosting the most migrants - we should not forget that."
"There are various reasons for migration: war, conflict, poverty, discrimination, violence and persecution, family, climate change and many more."
"We should address these issues and we should fight the push factors rather than the migrants themselves."
"In order to fight those push factors, we need a good development policy and, there, conditionality will not help much."
"We need to revise policies that go against our development goals, as sometimes happens in trade policy and agriculture."
"But we also need a good policy on democracy and promoting human rights."
"In the past, the Community and the Member States have cooperated with third countries on stopping migrants and not on human rights."
"The Commission had been negotiating an agreement with Libya to give support and aid to Libya so that Gaddafi would stop migrants."
"Now is the time to change that."
"I am very happy to hear that you agree with me that we urgently need to change to a more human rights-based approach."
"We should not forget that stability is not the only thing people want and need."
"Stability without democracy is not a sustainable way forward."
"Stability plus poverty does not offer any prospects."
"Stability is important, but it is not the only thing that matters."
"We must not close the doors to the few migrants worldwide that take the road to Europe."
"We need a common asylum system that gives efficient protection to those in need and we also need to protect conflict migrants."
"We need fair access to legal migration that gives migrants proper social rights."
"We need to find a way to protect climate migrants, as they have to flee because we cause climate change."
"We also need to revise our visa and border policies from a human rights perspective."
"We should not be scared of migrants."
"They are people like us, often in dire need, looking for a better life and peace and prosperity."
"Is that not what the EU was founded for?"
"So I ask the Commission: will the common asylum system be put in place?"
"Whatever happened to the Blue Card Regulation?"
"And how will you ensure that Article 208 of the Lisbon Treaty, namely, the principle of not harming our development goals, will be fully implemented?"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, above all, for the commitment you have made in putting together this package of measures, which I believe sends out a political signal making it clear that this is not Malta's problem, this is not Italy's problem, this is not Spain's problem: this is a European problem."
"I think that this is the thrust of the references you made to the solidarity between Member States and the European Neighbourhood Policy, the desire to promote adequate funding for the humanitarian emergency, assistance, repatriation and training, to intervene in the topic of asylum seekers, to draw up a programme that breaks the impasse, the sacrosanct reference to Directive 2001/55/EC, and the desire to strengthen the Hermes operation."
"All this is truly a sign of a European desire to challenge the apathy and the inconsistency of many months."
"At the same time, allow me to explain what lies at the heart of our concern."
"We are not primarily concerned about the 20 000 who arrived in Lampedusa."
"We are concerned with the political fact that this represents."
"For example, what happened in 1989, with the implosion of the Eastern system and the fall of communism, was a great burden, for example, on German and Austria, but then they found European solidarity."
"An attempt was made to respond politically to that challenge and offer a road map, which resulted in the integration of many countries and many peoples, who are now in this House."
"We do not expect much."
"There are no grounds for integration of the Mediterranean, but there are grounds for a neighbourhood policy finally worthy of the name, for a European Mediterranean strategy finally worthy of the name."
"This is what we are asking of Europe."
"I believe that what you said is along those lines."
"I would like to request, on the subject of Directive 2001/55/EC, for example, that in addition to referring to it as you did, the Commission should come up with a real proposal to bring to the Council, that it should be voted in by the Council with a qualified majority, and that this should lead European countries to an unavoidable understanding that the problem of immigrants is a European problem and an understanding that the problem of protecting immigrants is a European problem that we can no longer evade."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I also took part in the last debate in the Chamber on this very topic and I can only regret that, as only some of the proposals made in that debate have been taken into account, we have the numbers and the situations we are seeing today, specifically in Lampedusa."
"We are aware of Mrs Malmström's help and the efforts she is making, as Commissioner for the Home Affairs portfolio, to strengthen the European Borders Fund, the European Return Fund and the European Refugee Fund and, of course, running the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Members States of the European Union."
"However, this crisis in the Mediterranean clearly shows that the issue is not only one of the credibility but of the viability of the European common immigration policy, which aims for an area of freedom, security and justice, in line with Articles 67 to 89 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"The upshot of this is that this transformational challenging European foreign policy, challenging the viability of that strategy for the Mediterranean, of that association for the Mediterranean, poses a particular challenge to the humanitarian impact and significance of Europe in the handling of the humanitarian impact of displaced persons and potential asylum seekers and refugees."
"Consequently, I should again like to stress that one function of this debate should be to break, for once and for all, the deadlock on the asylum package; to call attention, for once and for all, to the need to implement and ensure compliance with Directive 2001/55/EC on measures for displaced persons in the case of humanitarian emergencies and massive, unforeseen, flows of emigrants."
"In addition to this, it should also, and most particularly, be to create a solidarity policy, above and beyond the directive, to bring into effect that solidarity clause that was again written in to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and which should be applied when we are faced with situations like this one."
"For, indeed, we must be aware that neither Italy, nor Spain, nor Greece, nor any of the border countries on the Mediterranean, are in a position to tackle these problems on their own."
"Furthermore, I am struck by the fact that there has not yet been any call, or request for the activation of Article 5 of that directive to apply that solidarity clause in line with the Treaty."
"We should obviously use this opportunity to provide a dignified and supportive response to an issue which is, as is the Mediterranean, a distinctively European issue."
"Madam President, we hear many people express concern about migration today."
"People are quite simply afraid of mass immigration to Europe following the major events in North Africa recently."
"These events are sure to be followed by migration flows."
"It has already started and it is sure to continue."
"It is inevitable that people will flee from instability and violence, particularly from the current situation in Libya."
"Hitherto, however, the migration flows have been more horizontal than vertical and primarily concern Tunisia and Egypt, but thousands of people have also arrived on the small Italian island of Lampedusa and this is really putting the solidarity between our Member States to the test."
"Worryingly enough, the EU Member States have so far not passed this solidarity test and do not seem to be willing to stand by one another in difficult times."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe believes that the most important thing we can do right now is to implement the Asylum Directive."
"The answer in the slightly longer term is the preparation of a common European asylum policy that is worthy of the name."
"This will, among other things, provide the opportunity to temporarily stop the transfers of asylum seekers under Dublin II when a Member State, for whatever reason, is extremely overburdened."
"With solidarity also comes responsibility."
"Every Member State must now respect and apply the directive that aims to harmonise the protection of people who are fleeing and, before 2012, develop a sustainable European asylum system."
"We have committed ourselves to implement this and we must do so and we must do it in a spirit of solidarity, with respect for international commitments for the common safety and stability of everyone."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I am very pleased that the Commissioner reminded us that the overwhelming amount of movement in the region has been in North Africa itself."
"The UNHCR estimates that over 400 000 people have already left Libya."
"That is something that, having listened to the debate on the Procedures Directive earlier, some of our Members would do well to remember: the majority of people are moving within North Africa."
"We very much welcome the support given to the UNHCR and other bodies in assisting those displaced."
"A lot of concern, however, has been voiced at the pressure on Malta and Lampedusa, and quite rightly."
"It is significant, but not equivalent to what is happening in Tunisia and Egypt."
"However, there is growing concern about what is happening to minors - unaccompanied or separated at arrival."
"There is concern that they are not being properly supported or identified."
"We hope that the Commission will look at their situation and at the situation of those others considered particularly vulnerable at this point."
"We also welcome the willingness to consider using the Temporary Protection Directive."
"Could the Commissioner please outline what criteria she will be using in making that assessment as to whether to bring forward a recommendation?"
"Madam President, Commissioner, refugees have been received in Lampedusa under appalling conditions, without food or toilet facilities: under conditions that are really inhumane."
"The detention centre is currently closed, with non-governmental organisations, journalists, and possibly even members of parliament not having access to it."
"The Italian Refugee Council is requesting that temporary protection orders be granted for these refugees, under the terms of Directive 2001/55/EC, and you approved this application, Commissioner."
"I thank you for your intervention, as this application was wide-ranging and comprehensive."
"There are things we agree with, and there are things with which we do not agree."
"However, there is also a name for what is blocking this comprehensive action: the hypocrisy of the Member States."
"You have spoken, Commissioner, about reaching a codecision on resettlement."
"As a rapporteur, I can say that Parliament is ready to look at any idea that the Council brings to the table."
"However, we have been waiting for a year and a half, and we have not heard a single idea about resettlement."
"It is this hypocrisy by the Member States that allowed Colonel Gaddafi to sweep refugees and immigrants under the carpet for years while they were selling him arms."
"That is why all the talk about the current lack of resources is also entirely hypocritical."
"In 2009 alone, European Union countries earned EUR 343 million from arms sales to Colonel Gaddafi, while the initial amount they made available for receiving refugees from the Arab revolutions was EUR 3 million: one hundred times less."
"I think that this difference says it all."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Lampedusa has been invaded by tens of thousands of North Africans that the island will never ever be able to accept."
"Italy has, for weeks, been targeted by hundreds of boats of illegal immigrants."
"If we do not react together, if the EU does not react, the migratory wave of displaced people will continue."
"The illegal immigrants who have arrived in recent months must be sent home; there is no alternative."
"However, apart from a few words of solidarity, the Italian Government has been left alone to handle this biblical exodus of such unforeseeable dimensions"
"Where is Europe?"
"Until now, Brussels has been guilty of hiding; my fellow citizens can no longer stand its shameful behaviour."
"Europe has left Italy alone to face the unprecedented emergency."
"Europe should instead assist Italy in the repatriation of illegal immigrants and must also support the efforts of the Italian Government to prevent thousands and thousands of people from continuing to leave, mainly from Tunisia."
"The Libyan refugees are a different matter: Europe should support Italy in the identification and logistics management operations, but, above all, must work to ensure that refugees are hosted in all Member States."
"The reception of those fleeing from the war cannot be the burden of Italy alone."
"It is time to stop talking."
"The European Union needs to make its presence felt."
"We cannot accept the fact that Italy is filled with illegal immigrants, while France rejects them so shamefully."
"The illegal immigrants should be sent back home, while all Member States must now commit themselves to receiving the Libyan refugees."
"(NL) Madam President, what we are now witnessing in Lampedusa was described and predicted as early as in 1973 by the French writer, Jean Raspail, in his prophetic novel The Camp of the Saints."
"The only difference is that reality is surpassing fiction."
"Europe needs to take control of this situation instead of just letting it happen."
"It is absurd to first applaud regime change in Tunisia and Egypt and to then immediately accept migrants en masse, or, more precisely, so-called refugees, from those countries."
"Everybody knows that virtually no one on those boats, which are mooring in Lampedusa, is eligible to be recognised as a political refugee."
"However, those people are now being allowed into European territory and, with the support of all kinds of subsidised groups, human traffickers and expensive lawyers, they will be starting procedures, drawing them out as long as possible and, if need be, going underground if they are not recognised as refugees."
"Judging by current events, Frontex is not protecting the external borders of Europe; it is treating them as a sort of welcoming committee."
"Those boats should be escorted back to the places they are coming from and genuine refugees should, as far as possible, be accepted in their own region instead of in Europe."
"It is also of fundamental importance that a number of international conventions are adapted to the needs of today."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to speak and to use this debate to talk about a fundamental issue: the emergency."
"They cannot cope alone."
"The root of this problem is, as everybody knows, in the unstable situations in Tunisia and Egypt, and the war in Libya."
"However, there is no limit to how long it will last: unfortunately, it will last a worrying length of time."
"We therefore need to decide how we can use our common policies to manage the emergency, because they cannot cope alone."
"In my opinion, Madam President, Commissioner, solidarity with the victims and solidarity with the host states and regions must be our priority."
"We have instruments that we are not using properly."
"We have four funds."
"Mrs Malmström told us clearly and briskly about sums that strike me as ridiculous."
"She spoke of EUR 30 million, EUR 25 million on request, etc. However, our four funds, the Refugee Fund, the Return Fund, the External Borders Fund and the Integration Fund, total almost EUR 3 billion within the scope of the financial perspectives."
"Mrs Malmström, it seems to me that these funds should be used for emergency situations, because we need to have the ability to use them and modify them."
"Our limitations in terms of collaboration and solidarity are symbolised by the fragility that the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union has demonstrated with the Hermes Operation."
"The arrival of increasing numbers of people fleeing the war and fleeing from desperation highlight how limited this capacity is."
"They cannot cope alone."
"Who can cope?"
"The European Union has the necessary solidarity to meet the requirements of this emergency in real time."
"(PT) Madam President, the Provera report could not have come at a more challenging time."
"Tunisia and Egypt, countries with enormous economic problems, have already opened their doors to more than 400 000 refugees from Libya."
"Despite this, European governments have chosen to whistle in the wind and ignore the 20 000 people amassing in Lampedusa in sub-human conditions."
"The revolutions in North Africa have made it even more pressing for European Union Member States to fulfil their humanitarian obligations to take in refugees, and to set out a new migration policy based on solidarity, and on the other fundamental values and principles of the European Union."
"The closed door and forced return policies used by some Member States over the last few years in relation to their Mediterranean neighbours may have prevented some migrants from reaching Europe, by means of increased controls within North African ports, patrols in the Mediterranean and even some more brutal methods, such as electric shocks."
"However, this has been at a scandalously high cost: the rights of migrants and refugees, forcibly returned to regimes such as Gaddafi's."
"The current emergency requires the adoption of a common asylum system, with shared responsibilities including a temporary protection mechanism and much more resettlement on offer."
"We need a new migration strategy that takes into account the original causes of migration, such as poverty, discrimination, conflict and political repression, among other things."
"Without this, traffickers will always manage to find alternative routes."
"The promotion of human rights, democracy and sustainable development therefore need to become a real strategic priority within the European Union's foreign policy, and within development programmes for the Mediterranean and beyond."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the emergency situation is teaching the European policy on asylum and immigration a serious lesson It is again evident that the EU does not have a legislative and operational framework that enables it to cope with extraordinary but not unforeseeable events, such as the events of recent months in North Africa."
"Lampedusa, Italy and Southern Italy are paying for these mistakes, but the main ones to pay are the refugees who are received in such an inhumane manner."
"Despite Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and the principle of equitable sharing of solidarity, all the countries are actually concerned only with their own affairs and the attitude of France, which shares a border with Italy, is unacceptable in the current European scenario."
"In this regard, I urge the Commission to consider the possibility of seeking an explanation from the French Government."
"For years, the EU has entered into agreements with third countries run by dictatorships, funding their activities and putting business interests before democratic requirements."
"Europe has remained silent before the Libyan raids: does it also intend to remain silent in the face of the unsustainable situation of the tent camps?"
"Of course, we all agree that we cannot make deals with Colonel Gaddafi, yet, a few months ago, I did not hear any objections to the Italy-Libya treaty, which has led to the immigration issue being addressed in the most inhuman way."
"Today, President Berlusconi tried to use the same approach with Tunisia, offering money."
"Perhaps, though, the new Tunisian Government has learned its lesson."
"Yet, like it or not, it is the responsibility of the EU and the 27 Member States to take action, bearing in mind the overriding priority of international solidarity and the protection of human rights."
"For this reason, I hope that the European Commission proposes the introduction of the emergency procedure laid down in Directive 2001/55/EC on temporary protection as soon as possible, and that this proposal is adopted by the Council in the near future, because otherwise it will be in vain."
"I also call for a parliamentary delegation, not a delegation of political groups, to be sent to Lampedusa to verify both the humanitarian conditions of the immigrants and the non-refoulement principle."
"(FR) Madam President, this report is sensitive, and I must criticise its title."
"The use of the words 'migration flows' sets the tone: it gives the impression that migrants are commodities or invaders."
"These are historic times for the peoples of the Southern Mediterranean and us, but the fear of mass immigration is preventing the EU and the Member States from creating a new dynamic."
"The recent democratic movements in the South have helped make us aware of our contradictions."
"They have demonstrated once again the inconsistency and lack of vision of our obsolete and out-of-touch cooperation policies."
"It is high time the European Union implemented a migration policy that is consistent with our values, that recognises that we live in a world in which people are mobile, a world in which human beings move around."
"To continue to talk about migration flows is absurd and goes against our humanist values."
"If we Europeans want to be major players in the world, then we have to change our approach and work towards creating a solidarity-based Union for the Mediterranean; we cannot do so without revising mobility policy, or what is today referred to as migration policy."
"We must meet the expectations of the peoples of the South."
"The fear of immigration must no longer guide our policies."
"Strengthening border controls must no longer be our main motivation in implementing cooperation agreements, as it was in the case of Libya."
"We must review the conditions necessary for any signing of agreements on the movement of persons involving readmission agreements, so that we respect human rights."
"Our actions are still characterised by a security-driven approach to mobility, which goes against our values and the requirement we have to protect populations."
"The scandalous position adopted by Mr Berlusconi and Mr Guéant must be vigorously denounced."
"Commissioner, what kind of policy must we adopt in order to establish a true Union for the Mediterranean, one in which we show solidarity with the peoples of the South, who today feel scorned by us?"
"(FR) Madam President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left will not be voting for this report."
"It does admittedly contain some positive points, but they are constantly contradicted by the practices of certain Member States, including my own country."
"This report refuses to see that migration is primarily a South-South issue."
"The failure to recognise this means that tensions will simply increase and will plunge a number of those countries a little further into poverty."
"True, the European Union cannot accommodate all the destitute people in the world, but it is in no danger of having to do so; the figures are there to prove it, regardless of the fuss some people are making."
"The European Union cannot accommodate all the destitute people in the world, but it should make a contribution that is in proportion to its wealth, its needs and the damage that it has caused and that is still being caused today by some of its companies, which are plundering those countries' resources."
"This report remains in the tradition of this inward-looking fortress Europe, in defiance of its own interests, particularly its demographic ones."
"No, the European Union has not learnt from the revolutions taking place in the Arab states."
"It is not showing solidarity."
"In the space of a few days, the Tunisians have accommodated more than 100 000 Libyan refugees in exemplary conditions."
"No, Commissioner, Europe's talk is no match for the problems facing the world."
"It will only fuel the xenophobic policies of certain Member States, and I regret that."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Commissioner Malmström for her hard work week after week in dealing with this epic disaster - because that is what it is."
"Comments have been made, not only in this House, in an attempt to reduce and make light of what our government, our country and our people have had to face."
"It has been, and continues to be, an emergency -humanitarian and otherwise - of exceptional dimensions."
"I believe that our government, and especially our people, have really come out of this well in terms of international public opinion."
"The people of Lampedusa behaved remarkably in firstly welcoming the migrants and then helping them out of their own pockets, and then, at a certain point, they said 'we cannot do this any more', because in addition to the human rights we discuss every day in this House, we must also consider the rights of peoples, including their right to maintain their identity, their activities and, naturally, not to be invaded."
"The migrants also include illegal immigrants, criminals released from prison."
"This rightly concerns the countries that must accept them."
"Furthermore, when the migration takes on the dimension - I repeat - of an invasion, we need to face up to the issue."
"We are one hundred per cent with our people, no ifs or buts."
"The European Union must stand up and take note, Commissioner."
"In addition to human rights, we must consider our rights, the rights of indigenous peoples."
"For this reason, we fully endorse the efforts being made by Italian Government at the moment in Tunisia, because compared to the modest figures announced by the Commissioner, the Italian Government is offering Tunisia a lot."
"A lot is being done and we are confident we will achieve tangible results"
"However, we must move from words to deeds and Frontex is not doing what should have been done to put an end to this hateful traffic, because this traffic is the shame of the Mediterranean and the European Union is partly responsible."
"Therefore, I say put a stop to people trafficking and I say yes to a Marshall Plan for these countries."
"(DE) Madam President, Mrs Malmström, it is well known that people from over-populated, under-developed countries risk their lives every day because the EU, with its pseudo-humanitarian ideas, has not made it clear that the rules that apply to migrants are not the same as those that apply to refugees."
"According to the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, refugees are, as we all know, people who, owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion or political opinion, are outside the country of their nationality."
"However, this definition does not apply to the vast majority of people who flood into Europe on a daily basis."
"Regardless of the situation in their home country, they just want to go somewhere in the EU - to the land that, in their mind, is flowing with milk and honey - in order to try their luck here and usually only in order to be included in our social systems."
"This may perhaps make sense in their eyes, but as members of the European Parliament, we have to serve the interests of Europeans."
"This certainly does not include permanently supporting millions of economic migrants who, with a lack of training and qualifications suitable for our labour market, are simply not much use to us."
"It would also be extremely unfair to countries like Tunisia and Libya in particular, which are only just freeing themselves from dictatorial regimes and starting out on the road to democracy and which will need all the strength they have to rebuild their own countries."
"These people must develop their own countries."
"Since the end of the Ben Ali dictatorship, Tunisia has been a free country."
"This situation must also be taken into consideration here in the EU in the discussions about how to deal with the mass influx of people from North Africa."
"Therefore, all economic migrants should, in my view, be sent back even before they reach Europe."
"They should not even be allowed to arrive in Lampedusa, and the EU agency Frontex should be given the appropriate powers by us to ensure that they do not."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard a series of measures and initiatives that are certainly reassuring and also along the lines requested by the Italian delegation in the meeting that we had last week together with the head of the delegation with President Barroso: more solidarity, more means, more specifics and more incisive action for Lampedusa, Malta and all the States that are exposed to exceptional migratory pressures that can only be tackled through European governance."
"These reassuring statements are naturally consistent with our thoughts on the application of Article 5 of Directive 2001/55/EC."
"We trust that this can be brought before the Council within an entirely reasonable timeframe."
"A more coherent European Neighbourhood Policy, based on results and on a policy of primacy in favour of border regions that can spend resources to ensure that their own young people can achieve work and growth opportunities in their own lands."
"A better and more adequate operational plan for Frontex, which has actually made itself useful by carrying out joint patrols during this exceptional stage."
"We believe that the section on funding for migration allows for the possibility of further action due to the exceptional state of affairs of which everyone is now well aware."
"Commissioner Malmström, we have not mentioned countervailing measures."
"Commissioner Hahn is not with you, and it would probably have been helpful if he had been."
"A review of Structural Funds, a policy that takes account of an exceptional situation, the reduction in attractiveness, the penalising of the attractiveness of the region of Sicily with regard to fishing and tourism, for which Lampedusa and Sicily must somehow be compensated."
"One hundred and fifty thousand Egyptians have returned to Libya, but this migration issue does not end here."
"For this reason, we must act very firmly through a strong and decisive European policy and we trust that you and President Barroso can develop that strategy through a comprehensive migration plan."
"We cannot wait for any more measures and we are confident that by the end of this month, Europe will come up with a migration plan, in the interest of the long-awaited solidarity that we want to see put into action at last."
"Madam President, first of all, when I hear some - not all - of my colleagues who are taking part in this debate, they refer to migration as something which is not currently taking place, but as something which is going to take place."
"A human tragedy is actually taking place as we speak in this House."
"In many cases, we are talking about whether we agree or disagree, but one thing that we should be in agreement about is that this tragedy, which is on our doorstep - a few hundred kilometres from the European Union's southern frontier - is taking place right now, and will continue to grow."
"Yet we continue to debate, even when there is a tool - Council Directive 2001/55/EC - which, on a recommendation from the Commission, can be set in motion by the Council."
"How are we going to measure whether the influx is high, not high or high enough when it is all over?"
"The European Union has to decide whether it wants to act or react."
"We react when things have already occurred."
"Let us not be the man of yesterday."
"Let us be today's institution."
"Madam President, efficient management, coherence, solidarity, responsibility: these are supposed to be the foundations of an EU common immigration policy."
"Contrast this with the actual record of the EU over the last decade, which deserves a score of about three out of ten."
"This is not the fault of the Commission, which has produced a stream of policies and proposed laws, but largely of the Member States."
"It is time to get off the reactive and chaotic back foot and onto the proactive, well-managed front foot."
"Maybe we could benefit from looking at a country like Canada, and especially its policies on legal migration."
"My own state, the United Kingdom, has stood apart from any idea of a common policy."
"I regret that, but when so many of those interviewed in places like Lampedusa say they want to move on quickly northwards and often specifically to the United Kingdom, it does not help persuade my country, which has had very large immigration itself, to lift its border controls."
"I believe in solidarity."
"I believe that the Temporary Protection Directive should be invoked now."
"However, there does have to be responsibility on all Member States - those in the north and also those in the south - to properly implement EU law on the reception of migrants and on the processing of claims with financial and other help, and also on integration and the enforcement of labour laws."
"Solidarity and responsibility has to be a two-way street."
"(FR) Madam President, I do not think that we can welcome the revolution in Tunisia, on the one hand, and demand that the country implements the border control policy that existed in the days of the Ben Ali dictatorship, on the other."
"I think we should stop putting pressure on the Tunisian Government, which has many other matters to attend to: its own refugees - as has been said - and overseeing its democratic transition process."
"The situation, then, is a new and exceptional one, and this should perhaps enable us to think up appropriate solutions while at the same time showing solidarity."
"Baroness Ludford is right - that is what is definitely lacking the most within the European Union."
"I think that the work of the European Commission, and of Parliament, could consist firstly in declaring a moratorium on the return of Tunisians, because that really is improper and inappropriate."
"We should also grant exceptional permission to reside to Tunisians who have already arrived in France and Italy, guarantee access to Europe to people seeking protection, and refrain from taking any steps or concluding any agreements that might get in the way of that protection, apply the provisions - as has been said - of the 2001 directive to all those eligible to take advantage of them, and accommodate refugees present at the border between Tunisia and Libya as part of the resettlement process."
"Next, I believe that we must think about forging cooperative links with these future fully democratic countries, so that Tunisians can come and work, study and travel perfectly legally, so as to create real channels of mobility between the two shores of the Mediterranean."
"(Applause)"
"(ES) Madam President, I believe that Lampedusa has become a symbol of the inhumanity of the European Union's immigration policy."
"This is not a just an immediate problem; it is a structural problem."
"I remember 14 February 2009, during the previous parliamentary session."
"I went to Lampedusa with a delegation from my parliamentary group."
"It was a journey into hell; into hell, I say!"
"That migration policy was not based on the understanding that emigration is a right and not a crime, and it did nothing to guarantee the sacred principle of the right to request asylum."
"In Lampedusa, in 2009, nothing was done to identify people or to process asylum requests until the people did what they had to do: rise up, mutiny, because they were living like animals."
"Between 2009 and 2011, nothing has changed."
"In fact, it could be said that something did change: President Berlusconi signed an agreement with Colonel Gaddafi in spite of the fact that Colonel Gaddafi was not complying with international law and expelled the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees knowing that he had 9 000 refugees in Libya; the same Libya that is currently being bombed after a humanitarian appeal."
"It is this hypocrisy that needs to be changed."
"This is what needs to fundamentally change in the European Union."
"Madam President, the Council decision adopts the UN Security Council Resolution."
"Let me quote it: 'To take all necessary measures to protect the civilians and civilian-populated areas under threat of attack in Libya, while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory'."
"That single sentence contains two completely contradictory ideas."
"How do you protect civilians from attack without occupying any piece of territory in order to do so?"
"How can nations with long and illustrious military histories, such as Britain and France, adopt such a nonsensical policy?"
"The answer to that is simple: they are bound to do so by the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy, as a result of the Lisbon Treaty."
"They no longer control their own foreign policy."
"The Council decision goes on to say that responsibility for the Union's military policy lies with the High Representative of Common Foreign and Security Policy. So Baroness Catherine Ashton will have the opportunity to wage her first war and put her name up there with the greats of military history such as Rommel, Montgomery and Eisenhower."
"Well good luck to her, but what is more likely to happen is that this idiotic policy results in disaster for all concerned."
"The priorities of the West, and the European countries in particular, should be to encourage moderate regimes in North Africa by all diplomatic means, and to protect our own borders from further mass migration flows."
"That may not be the politically correct answer, but it is a realistic one from sensible nation states, were they able to take those decisions."
"(NL) Madam President, last Friday, hundreds of so-called asylum seekers from the former Barbary broke out from their reception camps on the Italian mainland."
"These immigrants had been transferred there because Lampedusa is overfull."
"Madam President, this is the harsh reality: thousands of prospectless immigrants from Barbary are abusing the instability in their region in order to seek a better life in rich Europe."
"The immigrants who were interviewed on TV promptly indicated the cities they most wanted to go to - Amsterdam, Rome, it did not matter much - or to make matters worse, they complained about the lack of cigarettes and drink provided by the Italian authorities."
"You would almost forget that people consciously choose illegality and deliberately misuse social services in Europe."
"These so-called asylum seekers, whom I prefer to call freeloaders, must be received in the region."
"Their shelter is the responsibility of the African Union, the Arab League or the terrible Organisation of the Islamic Conference."
"The European Union is not responsible for these fortune seekers."
"If, nevertheless, they do come in, let us greatly accelerate the asylum procedures of these so-called refugees and send them back as soon as possible to the countries in and around Barbary."
"Let those countries take responsibility, not us and not now."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask my fellow MEP who spoke just now if it can really be considered appropriate to apply the terms 'freeloaders' and 'fortune seekers' to people who are fleeing from a situation of great political distress - and all the political groups agree on this - such as the one in North Africa."
"I find this to be an extremely serious allegation and call on the President to somehow highlight what has been said and establish whether this can be considered appropriate in such a sensitive debate that touches on the suffering of human beings, who are clearly not considered to have the right to eat, as it has been said of them 'they even demand food and are lot of freeloaders'."
"I find it very serious that this has been said in this House and I hope that European citizens can read this extremely harsh utterance, which only serves to reveal the total political inadequacy of the person who said it."
"(NL) Madam President, Mrs Costa, you are right, I am using harsh words, but those words are very clear."
"We in the European Union are now having to deal with a huge influx of refugees and the majority on the left are saying that these are just unfortunate people, all of whom are fleeing their countries."
"Fine, but why do they all have to come to Europe?"
"I think it is more difficult to reach Europe in a boat than it is to reach Morocco or Saudi Arabia."
"Obviously, they are coming here because of our social services and because they will be able to get money from the government here."
"You are just allowing all of that!"
"We must act firmly against this and we need to ensure that, as Members of the European Parliament, we stand up for the citizens of the European Union."
"If you stick to this line of thinking, it will be our downfall."
"Next, we will be looking to sub-Saharan Africa and, eventually, everyone will be coming here."
"We cannot afford that."
"That is your world, but not mine. I wish you every success with that, but that is not what our citizens want, certainly not in the Netherlands."
"Madam President, a few days ago, EU leaders announced that they stand ready to show concrete solidarity with those Member States most affected by migratory pressures."
"Well, that time has come, because the mass movement has now hit the European Union."
"We now call on the European Council to honour its word."
"And for solidarity to be concrete, it must mean that all Member States shoulder responsibility for the displaced people who are fleeing Libya towards Europe."
"We have a tool already; we just need to use it."
"It is the solidarity mechanism envisaged in Directive 2001/55/EC, which does two things."
"Firstly, it gives temporary protection to all displaced people who reach the EU."
"Secondly, it puts the responsibility to host them on all Member States and not just on the country that they happen to arrive in."
"The mechanism is triggered by a Council decision stating that the mass influx exists."
"However, it must come on a proposal from the Commission - from you, Madam Commissioner."
"There is no doubt that there is a mass exodus leaving Libya."
"More than 400 000 people have fled Libya, mostly to Tunisia and Egypt, but also now to EU countries."
"Last week, more than 800 people, mostly Somalis and Eritreans, arrived in Malta in just twenty-four hours."
"Proportionally speaking, this has the same impact as 120 000 arriving in France in just one day."
"Surely this would qualify as a mass influx."
"So it is not the numbers in absolute terms that we need to look at, but the numbers in relative terms - their relative impact on the country of arrival."
"I really appeal to you, Madam Commissioner, to take the political leadership and make this proposal."
"I also appeal to the Council to honour its word and show concrete solidarity."
"Madam President, the Council has refused to create an asylum policy and real formal burden-sharing since 1999."
"Speaking on behalf of David Sassoli and my Italian colleagues, what we see in Italy today is an emergency which has no real solution in law."
"A solution should have been found by now."
"Reception procedures, qualifications - the core of the asylum package which we are discussing today - should have been implemented long ago."
"We would then have had a concept of resettlement and a concept of burden-sharing, but we do not."
"For that reason, I say on behalf of my group that we must assist in this emergency."
"We call on the Council in particular - but also on you, Commissioner - to show that political leadership, and to apply Council Directive 2001/55/EC."
"That will create a situation of resettlement which may at least alleviate some of the burden."
"As well as doing that - as some have said - we cannot ignore our duties in relation to asylum and to international law."
"Those duties will apply to so many people who are vulnerable and suffering today."
"The reasons for the push factors of asylum are deep and profound - they are poverty and instability."
"However, we have a situation right now affecting the Southern countries and we need to implement Council Directive 2001/55/EC."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to address three points."
"Firstly, we should make it clear that we are indeed able to provide assistance to refugees from North Africa, particularly from Tunisia, and that we also want to do so."
"I therefore also welcome the fact that the Commission wishes to activate Directive 2001/55/EC for giving temporary protection and I would, at the same time, call for all Member States to actually utilise this, not only Italy, but also France and Germany - above all, the countries that are actually in a position to invest."
"Secondly, we expect a clear statement from the Commission to the effect that any agreements entered into with dictators like Ben Ali or Gaddafi concerning the prevention of migration - that is how I would describe them - are null and void."
"Genuine partnerships with third countries, like Mrs Malmström mentioned, are probably not comparable with Italy's idea of buying the readiness to take back refugees with EUR 150 million."
"Instead of showing solidarity in respect of the prevention of refugees, we should be showing practical solidarity with North African States like Tunisia, to which 150 000 people have fled."
"Thirdly, we need to understand how fragile the ground is on which the EU refugee prevention instruments are standing."
"Frontex and Dublin II - we need a rethink where these are concerned."
"We need liberal asylum and migration legislation in Europe and a different development policy that is genuinely sustainable."
"(FR) Madam President, at this stage of our debate, I am inevitably going to have to repeat or to support some of the things that have been said previously."
"However, like several of my fellow Members, I also wanted to say that the problems that we are having to face - problems which the whole of the European Union is having to face at the moment - cannot be resolved by one Member State alone."
"No Member State should have to rise alone to the challenges that it is facing and that, once again, the European Union as a whole, I believe, is facing."
"The ability of the European Union to organise itself and to handle the situation by working together and as one is therefore really what I am asking for."
"I believe that the time has truly come now to lay the foundations of a true European immigration and asylum policy."
"A European asylum and immigration pact was adopted over a year ago."
"The time has come now, I think, to apply it in a very concrete fashion."
"We heard the Commissioner; we heard a number of the recommendations that she was making."
"I would like to come back to them and to support very strongly some of her proposals."
"Yes, we must increase Frontex's resources at all costs."
"We must increase its human, material and financial resources, and we must ensure that it can provide greater support to Operation Hermes and Operation Poseidon."
"Yes, we need extra, additional resources for those Member States that are principally affected, I would say, by the increased migration flows that we are seeing today."
"That will be the financial expression of our solidarity."
"Yes, we need to forge closer cooperative links with the countries of the Southern Mediterranean; we need to support them, of course, help them, and find instruments."
"The Commissioner mentioned - I believe that she travelled to Tunisia to speak on this issue - mobility partnerships."
"Yes, we need to strengthen those instruments in a spirit of responsibility, in a spirit of solidarity, but also in a spirit of real, specific action."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you must have realised that this House enjoys plenty of solidarity, but this is not enough."
"To introduce and empower a European immigration policy, we must do together what others cannot do, in other words, achieve the consensus of governments."
"Take your proposals and put them before the Council."
"We shall support you, because you must have realised, apart from some xenophobic remarks, that you enjoy great respect and great solidarity in this House."
"Parliament will reaffirm this tomorrow, saying no to the refoulements, yes to the implementation of Directive 2001/55/EC and yes to the implementation of Article 25 of that directive."
"Tomorrow, we will do our bit in Parliament."
"However we need others to do their bit; for governments to be much less selfish; for us to be seen sponsoring the solidarity needed to implement a European policy."
"Your work is naturally central to this effort, because without the governments, Europe will be weaker."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, we have all been saying how we are faced with an increase in migratory flows, in terms of both scale and complexity."
"Chronic conflict situations in Afghanistan, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are now being joined by an alarming increase in new cases, such as Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, which have led to a dramatic worsening of the situation."
"Member States which, for geographical reasons, have been more affected by these migratory pressures, have also seen their ability to respond considerably reduced."
"The chaotic situation on the island of Lampedusa, which several speakers have already mentioned, is one example, with the number of refugees exceeding the number of residents."
"The Member States that are particularly affected therefore urgently need to receive the necessary support, through the provision of financial, human and technical resources, in order to ensure they are actually able to respond to the massive migratory flows, and to be able to respond with humanity to the human pressure with which we are faced."
"I therefore support the call made by my fellow Members for the European Union solidarity mechanism to be activated immediately."
"It is also important to take advantage of existing infrastructure and bodies, such as the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union and the European Asylum Support Office, and, probably, to reassess and adapt Operation Hermes."
"I also agree with what Mr Tavares has already said about the process for resettling refugees."
"It is important that the Council, which is not present for this debate, stops hiding behind legal pretexts and is able to bring this matter of refugee resettlement to a successful conclusion."
"Lastly, Commissioner, I believe that we need more solidarity between the Member States of the Union, improved coordination of efforts, and a sharing of responsibilities and burdens."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is sad to note that sometimes, the West can find great solidarity when it comes to bombing, sending companies into third world countries and taking oil, but finds it more of a struggle to make solidarity and migration policies."
"This evening's debate touches on these themes."
"I went to Lampedusa on Monday and saw 4 000 - 5 000 people on the ground, huddling together to sleep under the sun and the rain, doing their business where they ate and not being able to change the wet clothes - which some have said were designer labels, but are, in fact, fake designer labels - they had on during the crossing, in lamentable conditions."
"Among these were 4 500 children, 12-13 year-old kids, living under the same conditions, conditions of discomfort shared also by the inhabitants of Lampedusa."
"Tunisia is now home to 150 000 migrants who come from Libya and shows its solidarity."
"It is a poor country showing solidarity, while wealthy Europe is unable to accommodate 5 000 migrants."
"Europe should instead show its solidarity to these wonderful kids who have sparked the Jasmine Revolution originating in Sidi Bouzid that is changing North Africa and the world."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, your words are in line with what we wanted to hear."
"I would not, however, like to ideologise this debate which is sometimes ideologised in a bipartisan manner."
"I believe that it is a very serious matter to speak of a humanitarian emergency."
"The question I ask myself, and that I also address to my fellow MEPs, is as follows: 'Can we speak of humanitarian emergency and stop at that point, or should we ask two types of questions, one about the emergency and thus about the immediate issues, and another about strategy?'"
"The problem of Africa and the Middle East is a problem that must, by definition, lie outside Europe, and the question that arises is whether there can be development without democracy."
"Let us remember that the revolt in these countries of the Middle East and the Mediterranean has not been about ideology but about bread, a revolt for democracy in order to survive."
"We are bound to ask ourselves certain questions about this."
"It is all very well, Commissioner, to address the problem of Directive 2001/55/EC and everything that Frontex is doing, but Europe must ask itself what it wants to do about the Mediterranean and the whole of Africa."
"Many of my fellow Members have spoken of Libya and other countries."
"This makes me think of Darfur, of certain situations where genocide goes on every day in Africa."
"The only discordant note I would add is this: it is not true that Europe is responsible for looting."
"Of course, some European countries are partly responsible, but in Africa, a number of capitalist systems interact that are not based on the social economy of labour, like our own, but are based on the state economy, state capitalism."
"The leading example is China, which buys sovereign debts and exploits entire populations."
"We cannot go and oust presidents who are driven by crime."
"Even the UN cannot do this."
"I think that we should leave aside the ideological issues and think about the immediate problem, and that means welcoming these people, all of them together."
"Tomorrow, though, we cannot avoid discussing Europe's strategy towards the whole of Africa."
"(FR) Madam President, we have come to the end of the speeches, so I am going to focus on two points in the form of questions."
"Firstly, the humanitarian chaos in the Mediterranean is the inevitable consequence of the shortcomings, indeed of the lack of a common migration policy, within the European Union."
"To seek merely to prevent migration flows bound for Europe is unrealistic, and it means that, today, third countries and Member States in southern Europe are alone having to suffer the consequences."
"The Italian response - collective expulsions - is not acceptable, and neither is the French position of closing the borders; it resolves nothing and simply overlooks the real issues at stake."
"My first question is this: can we expect a shake-up and the development of a balanced European migration policy?"
"My second question concerns European solidarity also;"
"I do not see it as a slogan but as something that has become an urgent and absolute necessity."
"I, too, urge the Council to respond urgently and activate the solidarity mechanism provided for by the directive on temporary protection in the event of a mass influx, but I also urge the Member States to respond to the UNHCR's appeal for the urgent resettlement mechanism to be applied."
"Therefore, my second question is: can we expect concrete action at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 11 and 12 April?"
"(RO) Madam President, I believe that today's debate on the Provera report is welcome in view of recent events in the Mediterranean region and North Africa."
"I wish to begin by emphasising the need for an EU-level approach to managing the migration flows triggered by the wave of revolution in the Arab world, in the spirit of solidarity required by Article 80 of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"On the other hand, I wish to congratulate Mr Provera for his report which underlines the need to take into account consistently the deep-rooted causes of the instability which is the source of the migration flows."
"Plenty of events are going on at the moment, reminding us of the urgent need for action."
"In the wake of the post-election conflict in Côte d'Ivoire, for example, hundreds of thousands of Ivorians sought refuge in neighbouring countries, including 94 000 of them in Liberia alone, a country itself threatened by instability."
"In order to escape this spiral of instability and migration, I think that we need to emphasise, above all, the preventive aspect."
"By this I am primarily thinking of preventing conflicts."
"We must also consider promoting democracy and human rights, as well as, of course, improving the economic situation in the long term."
"Then again, in my view, we need to make better use of the instruments we have available as part of the global approach to migration in order to encourage synergy between migration and development."
"The issue of migration must automatically feature in the dialogue with Europe's partners."
"Efforts must also be stepped up in supporting development projects in the countries of origin and transit, which improve living conditions and these countries' ability to manage migration flows."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everything is uncertain as regards the situation in North Africa."
"We do not know the immediate outcome of the civil war in Libya, we do not know whether the new political order in the Maghreb countries and Egypt will be conducive to democracy, or whether even worse conditions will arise with regard to democracy and relations with Europe."
"As for the arrival of an unstoppable stream of fugitives from the shores of Africa onto European shores and those of Lampedusa in particular, it is difficult, even in this case, to distinguish those who are fleeing from violence and fear of death, those who have, for example, escaped from prison, and those who are looking for a future that holds better things than the hunger in their country."
"We can nevertheless be sure of certain things."
"Firstly, human dignity must be respected in all human beings."
"Secondly, the European approach is to offer hospitality to all refugees."
"Thirdly, the borders of the individual states which form part of the European Union are the borders of Europe."
"Fourthly, there is a duty of solidarity among all European countries that are part of the Union: this was confirmed, strengthened and made legally binding by the Treaty of Lisbon, which also governs migration policy and the management of migratory flows in an area of freedom, security and justice."
"Fifthly, the instruments for coping with emergencies such as the current one are already in place, in the form of Directive 2001/55/EC, Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO)."
"The current situation is one of those situations that reveals whether Europe actually is or is not a reality."
"Commissioner, I greatly enjoyed your speech, but I think we should move from words to deeds."
"I am well aware of this and I know you will act."
"We hope that your proposal will be followed up."
"The important thing is that words are not enough: we need deeds to make Europe a reality."
"This is an opportunity to build Europe."
"(EL) Madam President, we are at a turning point."
"I say this, because we need to consider how we intend to move forward, beyond the crisis facing us at the moment."
"We managed, in previous years, to limit migration flows from North Africa to southern Europe, to Italy, Spain, Portugal, Malta and Greece, through bilateral agreements between these countries and the corresponding countries in North Africa, and we really did achieve significant results."
"That is why there is now more pressure on Greece via Turkey, because Europe and Greece have been unable to apply similar agreements with Turkey, despite the fact that such bilateral agreements exist."
"My question therefore is this: now that all this disruption has broken out, what is to become of these agreements, Commissioner?"
"Could we - and should we - link these prior agreements or other future agreements to the financing we provide?"
"The package of measures you announced is very good and we must help these countries."
"It is our duty to help all our fellow men; however, this must be linked with an obligation on the part of these countries to take back everyone who has arrived in Lampedusa and everyone who arrives in the immediate or more distant future in other European countries, because the greater the pressure, the more people will arrive in other countries."
"While we are on the subject and as Directive 2001/55/EC has been raised, perhaps we should review what we were saying a year ago; several Members have referred to the famous reallocation that we have awaited so anxiously."
"We are still waiting to apply repatriation and resettlement; please tell us what else we should do."
"Perhaps, however, we should start straight away with the internal resettlement of refugees, so as to relieve the pressure on the countries which face a real problem?"
"Finally, because my time has run out, we must limit fragmentary approaches by the Member States."
"Some countries, such as Germany and France, are selectively suspending returns under Dublin II to Greece."
"We may face the same problem with Italy in the immediate or more distant future."
"The Greek Government has come along and announced another fragmentary approach: a fence in Evros, but we have no overall solution to the problem."
"This is such a vital issue that we need real solidarity and an overall strategy, Commissioner."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, the original plan was for this debate to be much narrower, covering only the Provera report."
"The Conference of Presidents decided to extend its scope, and so we are now discussing - and quite rightly too - current reactions to the influx of people who are, for the most part, refugees."
"For we cannot call them illegal immigrants, because they are refugees - from Syria and, above all, from North Africa, which is currently engulfed in revolutionary turmoil."
"Our debate is now also focusing on an overall assessment of the European Union's current asylum and immigration policy."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) on the Provera report, however, I would like to return to this document."
"I would like to raise two issues in connection with it, which, in my opinion, are absolutely vital."
"Firstly, I would like to say how much I welcome the fact that the report discusses the need for greater synergy between two key pillars of European policy, namely, development and security."
"The lesson we are learning today from the revolutionary events in North Africa tells us that aid provided only via official channels and distributed by the departments of dictator-led governments does not solve the social problems of people living in countries covered by EU aid policy."
"EU aid must genuinely help ordinary people to solve social problems, instead of lining the pockets of dictators and those in power."
"Not only economic reform, but also reform in terms of democracy and human rights should be a prerequisite for the granting of development aid."
"Today, we are seeing that young people from those parts of the world in which we are interested and which are covered by our development policy not only want bread, but also freedom and democracy."
"Secondly, in view of the demographic challenges facing Europe, it is becoming clear that the European Union will not cope with the problems already appearing on the horizon for the labour market without a coherent and genuinely rational immigration policy."
"The only thing that can prevent the influx into Europe of the least educated and most needy migrants looking for their place in the world is a well thought-out and coherent migration policy, as previous speakers have mentioned, such as those operated by Canada and New Zealand."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Mediterranean basin, and the current and foreseeable migratory flows, require the adoption of a medium- and long-term strategy different from the one announced by Commissioner Malmström."
"I think it is necessary to create democratic living and development conditions in African countries bordering the Mediterranean that will prevent the kind of migration we are witnessing."
"I therefore believe we need a special plan in the short term - some have defined it as a Marshall Plan - to stimulate and implement a process of development in the countries of North Africa."
"Only in this way can we stop and prevent future migration."
"I would also like to underline the need for compensatory measures in the areas involved."
"All the speakers talked of Lampedusa, but I would like to invite you to reflect on what the kind of migratory process we are experiencing at present really means for an island that lives on tourism and fishing."
"Tour operators have not received any bookings for months but only cancellations."
"Europe must show its support with appropriate compensatory measures."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak as a representative of Southern Italy and as a proud European, in the conviction that Member States should contribute to building a solid and lasting Union."
"Finding us unprepared for an emergency only 70 miles from our shores reflects the weaknesses of our 27-member system and the need to develop a greater sense of accountability and solidarity."
"An individualistic approach is likely to weaken Europe and set back the process of integration we have so painstakingly built over recent decades."
"Every corner of this Europe is Europe."
"Lampedusa is also Europe and this applies in all fields and in all policies."
"It is absurd to see that this emergency is being dealt with by only two member countries."
"We have chosen to join together to become stronger and, as in the best marriages, the union should be for better or for worse."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your words."
"We are bound to offer our full support when you speak of solidarity between Member States and when you emphasise that the Commission will call on Member States to be fully accountable to asylum seekers."
"Thank you because you have reassured us that everything that has been lacking will now come to pass."
"Through our vote tomorrow, we wish to give strength to your actions, give strength to your words, giving you a full mandate to ensure that what has been lacking will now come to pass."
"Unfortunately, not all European governments are adopting the same approach."
"Some consider the maritime borders of Italy to be the borders of Italy and not Europe and state in no uncertain terms that they do not wish to share the burden that only Italy and Southern Italy are shouldering."
"We therefore fully endorse your speech, but we endorse it in the belief that, through the strong action of the Commission before the Council, the solidarity of Member States with Italy should be real and substantial and all 27 Member States should demonstrate their accountability and their ownership of this emergency."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome your speech and the list of measures announced, and will not enter into the legal and regulatory debate on temporary protection of migrants and the application of Article 80 of the Treaty."
"As we speak, unseaworthy vessels continue to sail the Mediterranean to the Italian coast, their passengers often paying with their lives."
"Despite the recent transfers, Lampedusa remains in a situation of absolute emergency and people are still streaming into the tent city of Manduria."
"Italy continues to play its part in taking in these desperate people, while other countries are remarkable only for the number of expulsions taking place through their police stations."
"Our government is in Tunis attempting to limit to this flow, but we cannot continue to go it alone."
"We need the European Union, we need assistance and we need the political role of Europe to plan a new neighbourhood policy and a more efficient strategy on migration, starting from the failure of the Dublin system and the observation that Lampedusa is not only the border of Italy but also that of Europe."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as an elected representative from Southern Italy, I join the chorus of fellow MEPs who have preceded me in calling for appropriate action to address the critical situation faced by citizens and migrants in Lampedusa."
"The health and sanitation situation on the island has exceeded all limits of decency."
"I appeal to the sense of responsibility of the Italian Government to ensure it adopts all measures available to it, and call on the European Commission to implement the measures provided for in the EU Directive on temporary protection for immigrants."
"The next European Council of Ministers of the Interior, scheduled for 11 April, must take appropriate measures to ensure that neither the migrants nor the citizens of Lampedusa are left in a desperate condition."
"We therefore need to initiate a serious debate on the European Neighbourhood Policy which will focus on initiatives to support the path to democracy, especially in the countries of the southern shores of the Mediterranean."
"I congratulate Mr Provera."
"(PT) Madam President, we know that, in order to solve immigration problems, there is a need to support the development of immigrants' countries of origin, without outside interference, but with concrete action promoting solidarity, respect for human rights and the defence of peace, whether in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya or any other country."
"Nevertheless, this is not what is happening, a sad example of which is the situation in Lampedusa."
"There is an urgent need for serious measures; solidarity measures; measures that will bring this tragedy to an end."
"I would like, Commissioner, to draw particular attention to the situation of immigrant women."
"There is a need to guarantee such women the right to their own passport and residency permit, which is also important for combating human trafficking, in particular, that of women and children; support for the resettlement of refugees also needs to be linked to this."
"Finally, I challenge the Commission to review the Return Directive as soon as possible: a directive that is against immigrants fleeing war, hunger and misery, whose only wish is to be happy with their families, and who deserve our solidarity."
"(EL) Madam President, Mr Provera has done an excellent job and I congratulate him."
"His report takes a realistic view of the problem and his proposal on sharing the burden of immigration is a necessary solution."
"I therefore propose that we broker an agreement that will improve and update the Dublin Regulation."
"Events illustrate that we will not resolve the question of immigration and that it will continue."
"We cannot eliminate it, but we must manage it."
"Greece, Italy and Spain cannot deal with it alone, because these countries are under severe pressure."
"We have failed to address the problem since 1990."
"We consider that it does not exist, we leave the Member States to their fate and these poor people are being exploited, as are the natives of Europe suffering this burden."
"We must not forget that there are 7 million unemployed in Europe today, 3 million of whom are 19 to 24 years old."
"(RO) Madam President, in his memoirs entitled 'How Stalinism was born', Stalin's former assistant, Boris Bazhanov, recounts a scene which occurred in the Kremlin in December 1923."
"In a discussion with his comrades, the Georgian murderer said something which would cause a stir. It is not important who votes in the party and how."
"What is of paramount importance is who counts the votes."
"As a result, it will come as no surprise to us, for instance, that Nursultan Nazarbayev was recently re-elected in Kazakhstan with more than 95% of the votes."
"It is the same story in Romania where absolutely every election is rigged."
"This charade for democracy is orchestrated by the local mafia under the direct protection of the US Embassy in Romania, which actually decides what is better for the Romanian people."
"Indeed, the WikiLeaks telegrams highlight that, unfortunately, Romania has become a fourth-hand outpost of the CIA, which is demonising Stalin, but using his methods."
"What a disgrace!"
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this point of the debate, practically everything has been said, and perhaps that is exactly the point."
"We continue to talk and, as we speak, the landings are continuing and people are dying at sea and crowding in inhumane conditions on the Italian and Maltese shores, which are not the shores of Italy and Malta, but the border of Europe, gateway to our European Union, through which any of our 27 Member States can be reached."
"The time for talk is over, we are told by our citizens and the migrants who sought freedom and found themselves locked in closed camps."
"It is time to act, Commissioner."
"I call on you; we call on you to take the lead as early as tomorrow, after our vote, and to send a request to the Council for the implementation of Directive 2001/55/EC and jointly establish a true strategy for the future of the Mediterranean, because at stake is not only Europe's credibility but also its immediate fate."
"(RO) Madam President, this debate is taking place at a critical time for the future of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"In this context, I believe that the incidents which Italy has encountered in Lampedusa highlight the need to devise an EU migration policy focused on the following areas."
"Firstly, the EU should focus on the causes of migration flows."
"By this I mean the precarious economic situation and unstable political climate in the countries of origin."
"By creating jobs and increasing investments in these countries, the Union would encourage their citizens to become involved in their own community."
"Secondly, I believe that migrants' rights need to be protected."
"It is the duty of the Frontex agency, in particular, to implement the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the other international treaties in this area."
"Madam President, the debate this evening has been characterised by the use of the word 'solidarity'."
"All too often in this Chamber, Members speak in their own national interests, but it might be better if more of us spoke about concerns in other countries, to show solidarity."
"The reason I asked for the floor was that I was very struck by the numbers used by my colleague, Simon Busuttil, of 800 people arriving into Malta being the equivalent of 120 000 arriving into France on one single day."
"The problems of Malta and of Lampedusa are European Union problems."
"I talked extensively about the idea of solidarity during the Lisbon Treaty debate."
"We need to debate the concept of solidarity in this Parliament because I fear that solidarity is sundered in the European Union at the moment, not just on this difficult issue, but on many others."
"It is time that we, as a Parliament, grappled with it and put European Union solidarity back on the map."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, this is indeed a challenging situation."
"North Africa is, of course, facing a challenge."
"The people there are now trying, especially in Tunisia and Egypt, to build new countries - democratic countries where there is respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law."
"They are preparing for elections later this summer."
"We should do everything to support them in this fantastic journey."
"The Commission is, as you know, preparing a revised strategy for the neighbourhood and it will be presented to the Council."
"It will contain support for democracy, support for economic development, growth and job opportunities, and there will also be an element of mobility."
"This is a challenge for which we should provide our support."
"We also have a challenge in Libya, where the increased violence is creating a very insecure situation and forcing many people to flee."
"It is a challenge for European migration policy."
"In the long term, we need to develop a more global approach to this, very much in line with Mr Provera's report, the input of which will be taken into account."
"In the short term, we, of course, need to conclude the asylum package."
"Believe me, Mrs Keller, we are trying to do that."
"With the help of the European Parliament and the efforts of the different rapporteurs to get the package together and conclude the negotiation with the Parliament, I still hope that we can finalise this before the end of the year."
"There is a challenging facing Lampedusa and Malta."
"I would like to reject some allegations that the Commission, or 'Brussels', has not been engaged in helping Italy."
"We have, in fact, offered assistance to Italy."
"For the remaining period under the current long-term budget, there is EUR 171 million in the national envelope for Italy."
"Some of that money has not yet been used for Italy, and we have been working with the Italian authorities on an almost daily basis to see how programme financing can be reallocated so that it can be used to address the situation in Lampedusa."
"We have also offered Italy assistance to reimburse some of the costs of internal transfers of migrants."
"We have the Frontex Hermes operation, but I would like to remind you that Frontex depends on the contribution of the Member States, and that will be running out in a very short time."
"We have the answer: we have Europol in place."
"We are engaged in talks with Tunisia to seek a solution on an organised, dignified, voluntary return of those people who are not in need of international protection."
"We are helping Tunisia to fight the trafficking networks and seeing how we can assist it in building up border control."
"This is part of a larger mobility partnership."
"Most of the refugees are in Tunisia and Egypt."
"As I said, more than 400 000 people have left Libya."
"Most of these people have been repatriated."
"They are mainly Tunisians and Egyptians, but they also come from about 30 different countries, mainly in Africa."
"There are also people from Bangladesh, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc."
"Most of these people have been repatriated through European assistance, with the Member States working in a true spirit of solidarity with Tunisia and Egypt."
"But there are some people remaining. I visited these refugee camps only a few days ago."
"The Tunisians are doing impressive work together with international organisations, such as the UNHCR."
"But there are a few people there, a few thousand, who are stranded."
"They cannot return home."
"We need to assist these people."
"They need to be resettled in Europe."
"It is very difficult for me to explain to these Somalis that you cannot come to Europe because we have not agreed on delegated or implemented acts."
"So please, I urge you and the Council to come to an agreement on this, because we could really fulfil the aim of the European resettlement programme and help those people, because they have nowhere to go."
"We are also seeing refugees coming to Europe now - to Lampedusa and to Malta."
"I realise that Malta, of course, with the size of the island, is under enormous pressure."
"We might see more people coming."
"Many of these people might be in need of international protection."
"As long as the violence goes on in Libya, the risk of more people having to flee will increase."
"These people are indeed a European challenge."
"They will probably need shelter."
"We have certain funds."
"We have certain agencies."
"We have certain policies to try to assist these people."
"As I said, we are considering the possibility of using the temporary protection mechanism."
"This can be activated when there is a mass influx of people who are unable to return."
"But for this to be activated, it needs a qualified majority in the Council."
"Today, that majority does not exist."
"We are, of course, monitoring this very closely and we will bring it back to the Council next week."
"But before we activate this mechanism, I am calling - and I will continue to call - on Member States to put solidarity into action: not only to come out with beautiful words, but to act."
"We need to find solutions to assist Italy and Malta and possibly other countries who will be under pressure."
"I urge Member States to do this."
"There are solidarity funds available for European countries who respond to this appeal."
"This will all be discussed at the Justice and Home Affairs Council next week."
"I will be happy to report back to you after that."
"Thank you very much, Madam President, for a very important debate."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like some clarification from Commissioner Malmström."
"The Commissioner said activation of Directive 2001/55/EC will be discussed within Council."
"You will discuss it next week with Council because, if I understand correctly, we currently lack a qualified majority."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, maybe I was unclear there."
"Everything that I presented to you, including some experiences from Egypt and Tunisia, will be discussed at the Council next week."
"Of course, the situation in North Africa is the main point on the agenda."
"There is a reference in my speech to this temporary protection mechanism, but I do not know if there will be a decision or anything like that."
"It is very much up to the Presidents as to how they want to monitor this, but we are monitoring this situation on an hourly basis."
"I just wanted to say that to date, there is no such thing as a qualified majority to activate this protection mechanism."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, before I come to the report, I would like to respond to Mr Meyer and Mr Tavares."
"I really respect the opinions of everyone, but it seems to me that their views on Lampedusa and what is happening in Lampedusa are hardly generous."
"I wanted to inform them that 12 000 people arrived in Lampedusa within the space of three nights."
"Lampedusa is a small island with 6 000 inhabitants and 12 000 people arrived suddenly in three nights, increasing the population to 20 000."
"I think it is very difficult for any country to accept such a large number of people arriving in such a short space of time on a small island which has no facilities for such a great number of arrivals."
"There are currently 1 400 migrants on Lampedusa."
"Much has been done, and as soon as sea conditions permitted, the migrants were transferred to other centres, primarily in the south of the country."
"This brings us to the report."
"I wanted to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the different political parties who, with their different sensibilities, have contributed very effectively to this report."
"They made a fundamental contribution, in absolute transparency, in the same spirit that inspired us all at the beginning."
"I also thank Commissioner Malmström for the enthusiasm she has shown for the concept of burden sharing, which should influence her work within the Commission and thus within Council."
"If she continues to show the same enthusiasm, I think the results will follow."
"I end by saying that the situation is very difficult to sum up."
"Insofar as a summing up is possible, I would like to say that any policy will be ineffective and incomplete as long as huge differences persist between the levels of development in the North and South of the world, as long as huge differences persist in the quality of democratic institutions, and as long as there are vast differences in respect for human rights."
"We must take action as part of a major policy of strategic cooperation and aid that will have an impact on the structural causes that led to these huge inequalities between North and South."
"If we solve those structural causes, the rest will follow and the world we all live in will probably be a better place."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 5 April 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I am highly critical of the action that the EU is taking with regard to migration."
"The different interests of Germany, France, Spain and the other Member States, divided between Northern and Southern Europe, are placing Italy in a very awkward situation."
"The Italian Government would do well to procrastinate less and act more, rejecting migrants until Europe comes up with a genuine common immigration policy."
"The European Union needs a common asylum policy and to ensure that the principles of solidarity and burden sharing do not remain mere promises on paper."
"This would be the situation if Italy were to take on the burden of a situation that is changing the face of North Africa and the entire Mediterranean region."
"Italy can no longer accept Libyans, Tunisians and Egyptians until France, Germany and Austria cease rejecting anyone who comes from North Africa through their territory."
"Until Brussels coordinates the management of migration flows with the governments in Paris, Berlin and Vienna, as well as Rome and the other Member States, Italy would do well to adopt a much more uncompromising stance than it is doing at present."
"The report on migration has a solution for preventing migration flows."
"The rapporteur believes that we should prevent migration by investing in the countries that are the source of migration flows."
"In a time of economic and financial crisis, however, it is not possible for the EU to 'finance' the third world on a massive scale, at the expense of maintaining the living standards of European citizens."
"There have been, there are and there will continue to be enormous economic differences between the EU and Africa."
"If these differences were erased, and third world citizens no longer had any reason to migrate to the EU, it would be because we had contributed to a decline in standards in EU countries."
"We must not delude ourselves that migration results only from violations of fundamental human rights."
"A large percentage of migrants come to the EU only for a 'better' life."
"Sociological research shows that the greater the percentage of migrants in the EU, the more dissatisfied local people are with their way of life."
"If the number of migrants exceeds a certain percentage, they lose interest in becoming part of European society and, on the contrary, create their own society within the EU."
"The EU should focus migration policy exclusively on violations of human rights."
"The financial and economic differences between migrant countries and the EU should not be a reason for providing funding to these countries."
"The policy on preventing migration must be combined with a policy on the prevention of migration at the EU's external borders."
"The events in North Africa have resulted in a new migration flow on Europe's southern border."
"While we ponder solutions to this acute problem, we also need to examine its causes."
"The fall of the Arab dictatorships may be one of the major turning points in global politics since the collapse of the Iron Curtain some 20 years ago."
"It is, above all, a tremendous chance for democracy and civil rights."
"Like all revolutions, this one also entails a risk."
"At its most critical, it is visible when dictators who abuse their powers threaten their own citizens, as is happening in Libya."
"Europe and its allies cannot and should not just sit idly by while there is unrest on its borders."
"We have one common mission: we need to do all we can to protect the lives of innocent citizens, including women and children, when no one else can."
"The democratisation of North Africa, a respect for human rights, and the emerging economic growth associated with these are the best way to stem the human tide on Europe's southern border."
"For weeks now, thousands of migrants have been landing on the shores of the Mediterranean and, in particular, in Malta and Lampedusa, fleeing the situation in their country, where unprecedented political instability reigns."
"Frontex has rightly launched Operation Hermes to help the Italian authorities cope with this mass influx of migrants to their shores."
"The management of this humanitarian crisis must not be left to the Italian authorities alone."
"The control of the EU's external borders must be a joint effort, because it is a joint challenge."
"This mass influx of third-country nationals will result in waves of illegal migrants entering many Member States."
"We need only see how the French authorities are intercepting every day hundreds of illegal migrants arriving straight from Italy."
"We know full well that those asylum seekers include many economic migrants who 'slip' into these mixed migratory flows."
"Moreover, the European effort must be stepped up."
"The Member States must provide Frontex with the resources it needs to carry out its missions."
"We also need to cooperate more with the Tunisian authorities."
"Tunisia must fulfil its readmission obligations."
"in writing. - The situation in Libya at present is very uncertain."
"What is certain, however, is that it has brought about a humanitarian crisis."
"As this report describes, armed conflicts, especially when they involve human rights abuses, give rise to huge increases in migratory flows to neighbouring countries."
"In view of the massive proportions these could lead to, the EU's Frontex programme cannot be the best tool to deal with such levels of migration."
"The EU must, as of now, set up and plan a proper response, including a detailed burden-sharing action plan to help refugees resettle in a coordinated manner."
"This should be based on the solidarity clause contained in Article 80 of the TFEU."
"One could quibble about what particular number of refugees could be defined as an 'emergency'."
"However, we need to have a detailed plan laid out, with clear thresholds on a country-by-country basis, so that EU governments and the Commission are both ready and well prepared to deal with an imminent crisis."
"As a Maltese MEP, it is very disappointing that the Commission is apparently so under-prepared to deal with a crisis that has long been inevitable."
"The motion for a resolution highlights a very significant and important matter."
"It not only focuses on the problem of equal treatment for women and men in rural areas, but also points directly to the need to create equal opportunities for women living in rural areas, similar to those enjoyed on a daily basis by women living in urban centres."
"I think that we have paid too little attention in Parliament thus far to the social and professional development of women in rural areas."
"Women living in rural areas come up against many obstacles every day, both economic and infrastructure-related, which, to a significant extent, limit their opportunities in terms of access to education, health protection and, most importantly, the labour market."
"After all, not many job offers are targeted at rural areas, mainly due to the fact that these areas are significantly less developed in economic terms."
"That is why it is so important to support rural development policies by improving access to advanced infrastructure, or by means of opportunities to benefit from highly developed information and communications technologies."
"I am sure that the Members of the European Parliament can also do a great deal to ensure that rural areas catch up with the benefits of civilisation."
"We are, after all, able to organise various kinds of training or workshops, during which we can provide real help in accessing EU funds earmarked for the development of rural areas."
"One-minute speeches (Rule 150)"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(GA) Madam President, it must be the aim of the European Union to greatly reduce the incidence of fatalities and serious injuries and to improve road safety."
"I do not accept the need to wait until 2033 for the European Driving Licence to be put into effect."
"At present, there is just a European model for the driving licence but what is meant by that, really?"
"We want to protect road users, if there is the political will to do so, and I firmly believe that modern technology now available can shorten the period for putting Directive 2006/126/EC into effect."
"We cannot wait any longer - that is extremely important."
"The Commission must do something concrete about this."
"(HU) Madam President, democracy, freedom, solidarity and Christian ideals are the common European values that I believe in."
"These were also avowed by Count János Eszterházy, a Slovakian Hungarian politician, who was condemned on trumped up charges by the Communists in 1947 and died a martyr's death in Mírov prison in 1957."
"Apart from his countless other merits, he was the only politician who, as a Member of Parliament, condemned and voted against the deportation of the Jews in the Parliament of the fascist Slovakian state in 1942."
"His only crime was to stand up without fail for the Hungarians of Slovakia who, together with the German-speaking citizens, were vilified en masse, and made stateless and displaced under the shameful Beneš decrees."
"The EU should be ashamed that these inhumane decrees legitimising state terror are still in force, and the rehabilitation of János Eszterházy, as well as hundreds of thousands of citizens deprived of their human dignity, is still awaited."
"I call on my honourable fellow Members to have deeper concern about protecting our common European values."
"(RO) Madam President, this year, the separatist demonstrations organised by the Hungarian extremists in Transylvania to celebrate Hungary's national day were marked by a worrying display of radicalism, especially due to the support and declarations from senior representatives of the Hungarian State and one of the European Parliament's vice-presidents."
"The Hungarian celebration on 15 March jeopardises from one year to the next the good understanding between Romanians and Hungarians."
"In this situation, provocative gestures, such as the recent action by a Hungarian extremist who symbolically hanged the hero of the Transylvanian Romanians' struggle in 1848 for their national rights, only serve to threaten peaceful coexistence."
"I strongly condemn these displays of extremism."
"I call on the Romanian authorities to swap political complicity for legal measures."
"I also appeal to the European forums to take action to halt the escalation of ethnic hatred and territorial separatism in a region where the wounds of the past have a unique opportunity to be closed with the help of European values."
"(LV) Madam President, I should like to pose you a question."
"Do you think it is possible to close French schools in Belgium?"
"Or, let us say, German schools in France?"
"You are right: it is not possible."
"Yet in Latvia, where more than 40% of the population is Russian-speaking, it is possible."
"Today, in the Latvian Parliament, nationalist and Nazi members wish to hold a referendum on the closure of Russian schools in Latvia."
"At the same time, OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities, Knut Vollebaek, arrives in Latvia and announces that he can be proud of integration in Latvia Do you think that I am joking?"
"You are mistaken."
"What, moreover, do you think will happen if Russian schools are closed in Latvia?"
"I shall tell you - a civil war will break out in Latvia."
"If the European Parliament does not react today to this overt radical initiative, by tomorrow, it will already be too late. Thank you."
"(ES) Madam President, the nuclear crisis in Japan must not be exploited for manipulative purposes: the public is expecting us to respond and to act."
"The first thing is for the announced safety tests to be carried out quickly and transparently, and for States to be required to close obsolete or unsafe plants."
"The first tests should be carried out at first-generation plants, which use the same technology as Fukushima."
"They are at the end of their useful lives and are technically obsolete."
"This is why I am asking you to support the request from all the institutions of the Basque Country to urgently close one such plant: the one in Santa María de Garoña."
"More than 2 million people live within a radius of 80 km of it."
"Moreover, more work needs to be done on prevention from an urban planning and civil protection perspective, on safety in terms of deciding where to site these kinds of facilities, and on drafting a European protocol, to enable us to take effective, well ordered and rapid joint action to deal with large-scale catastrophes."
"Madam President, the Commission's Secretary-General, Catherine Day, recently described the Irish bank bailout as 'tough but sustainable'."
"This is not a bailout but a sell-out: a sell-out, at EU insistence, to bondholders - senior, junior, secured, unsecured - every type, category and class of bondholder, while Irish taxpayers shoulder intolerable debt."
"The cost of the bank bailout is EUR 70 billion, not to mention the EUR 200 billion in emergency funding from the ECB."
"How is a small island of 4.4 million people supposed to cope with this madness?"
"The debt burden for every man, woman and child in Ireland is roughly EUR 160 000 just to bail out the banks, and that is not including the interest."
"A little comparison: if France - population 62 million - were faced with an equivalent banking crisis, the debt of French citizens would be EUR 1 trillion."
"Would the Commission describe that as 'tough but sustainable'?"
"Finally, Catherine Day was also wrong when she said that this is not a crisis of the euro."
"If the European Commission does not recognise that and act on it, then the future of the eurozone, and not just that of Ireland, is bleak."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the current international economic crisis, Catalonia is showing very positive signs, such as a 16% increase in exports last year, but also very negative symptoms such as youth unemployment in excess of 40%."
"One of the main reasons for these difficulties is the loss of tax revenue suffered by our country each year, which is equivalent to more than 10% of gross domestic product, a figure that is much higher than the contribution of the richest Länder to the entire Federal Republic of Germany."
"The economic strangulation of Catalonia hits one of the main economic drivers in Southern Europe and, for this reason, is a problem for the European Union as a whole."
"(PL) Madam President, the Republic of Lithuania has recently adopted an Education Act which changes the education system in such a way that there are fears that a significant number - at least half, and maybe more - of the Polish schools in Lithuania may be closed."
"This is a further example of discrimination against the Polish national minority which has lived in the country for centuries, going back many generations."
"After the introduction of a ban on writing Polish names using the Polish spelling and a ban on the use of Polish place names, and even instances of Poles being penalised for using their own language, we are dealing with a further instance of discrimination, this time affecting education."
"This is all the more lamentable since there is no conflict between the peoples of the two countries, and yet the Lithuanian authorities are irresponsibly igniting and fuelling such a conflict, which may have extremely adverse effects."
"We concern ourselves with violations of human rights in various places around the world, and yet such regrettable developments are taking place right here in the European Union."
"It is high time that the European Union looked into this matter."
"It is a disgrace, not only for Lithuania, but for the European Union as a whole. Thank you."
"(EL) Madam President, the Turkish Prime Minister commented on the Oomen-Ruijten report on Turkey's progress towards accession by stating that the report is unbalanced and that he personally considers those who drafted it to be unbalanced."
"A few days later, Turkish Cypriot trade union leaders rallying outside the European Parliament in Brussels chanted that the Turkish political leadership does not only insult the MEPs who voted in favour of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report; it also insults the Turkish Cypriots who turned out in force in occupied Cyprus to protest against the repression exerted over them by the 40 000 Turkish troops and countless numbers of Turkish settlers."
"Speaking at the rally, Turkish Cypriot politician, Izzet Izcan, said that Ankara was violating international law by changing the entire demographic structure by moving people from Turkey, thereby putting the very existence of the Turkish Cypriot community at risk and emphasised that anyone who respects human rights, such as the European Union, cannot brook such violations."
"Shall we, as the European Parliament, brook this violation, Madam President?"
"I call on you to convey this protest by the Turkish Cypriots both to the Council and to the Commission, so that they can take appropriate action before it is too late."
"(EL) Madam President, North Africa is up in flames following the political developments in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya."
"This crisis is sucking in other countries in the Middle East, with unfortunate, politically dubious and ambiguous consequences."
"At the same time, Turkey is being given considerable autonomy by decision makers in the West, with clashes between Ankara and Israel and tighter relations between Turkey, Iran and Brazil."
"Turkey is also gaining autonomy from US policies for the Middle East and from European commitments on future accession to the European Union."
"There is continuing instability in the countries of former Yugoslavia which is feeding nationalistic groups."
"Finally, according to reliable international statistics, the Muslim populations which currently number 1.6 billion will rise to 2.2 billion by 2030, whereas the population of Europe will fall by 50 million."
"My question is this: do European leaders understand that the destabilisation of the South will have an adverse impact both on the euro and on the geopolitical stability of the security system in the West?"
"Madam President, I had intended to speak on the impact of the financial crisis in the Republic of Ireland on the economy in Northern Ireland."
"Instead, it is with deep regret that I inform this House of the callous and brutal murder of a member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland."
"Twenty-five-year-old Constable Ronan Kerr died at the hands of Republican terrorists on Saturday afternoon."
"Constable Kerr, a Catholic police officer, was murdered when a booby-trap bomb planted under his car exploded on Saturday as he left for work."
"He died at the scene."
"I call on this House to condemn this atrocity and to call for an end to such violent acts at the hands of Irish Republican terrorists intent on dragging Northern Ireland back to its darker days and derailing the political process."
"Since 2007, dissident Republican terrorists have planted dozens of booby-trap bombs under the private cars of police officers."
"Thankfully, most of these have failed to detonate."
"I am sure that you will also join with me in calling for all information regarding this murder to be given to the police."
"There are people in the local community who have information about Constable Kerr's brutal murder."
"They need to come forward and bring these murderers to justice, not shield them from it."
"They need to do it for the future of our country and out of respect for a brave police officer and his grieving mother and family."
"I am also appalled at the lack of respect that this speech has been given by some Members of this House."
"(EL) Madam President, in ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the 27 Member States have committed to equal rights, equal treatment and equal opportunities, thereby ensuring that these citizens can participate fully in society."
"However, as we have seen, this does not apply to everyone."
"Around 30 million blind people living in Europe face huge difficulties in everyday activities, such as shopping, because they have to rely on other people to tell them what is inside the packaging."
"I should therefore like to call on the Commission to open broad consultation with interested bodies on the adoption of a voluntary product labelling system in Braille and, at the same time, to call on my fellow Members here to support it by signing written statement 14."
"(EL) Madam President, the conclusions of the last summit provided anything but reassurance."
"The clear provision for the facility for a Member State to restructure debt post-2013 is a straightforward departure from the European Union's original position when the crisis broke, that debt restructuring would be precluded at all costs."
"Already in Greece, the debate by distinguished economists at international level and the markets has taken off again."
"What happened to change this position?"
"Every effort was made, no cost was spared; perhaps we just ran out of steam."
"The truth is that the forecasts and estimates made are not being verified."
"The recession is getting worse in Greece instead of better, government spending is at -9%, when it should be at +8.5% based on the memorandum for 2011 and, worst of all, unemployment has already topped 15%."
"There is only one answer to this: growth."
"Is there any sign of growth?"
"No, there is not; we need policies for growth, not reversals and talk about restructuring."
"(HU) Madam President, the Hungarian EU Presidency has reached half-time, so it is worth reviewing the achievements to date."
"A major success is that agreement in principle was reached recently in the Council about the package of six legislative proposals to strengthen economic governance."
"The rapid adoption of the new legislation by Parliament may greatly improve the competitiveness of the European economy."
"The energy summit in February also brought a real breakthrough."
"As a result of the strengthening of the common energy market and infrastructural development, a common European energy policy may be created at last."
"Apart from this, agreements of key importance have been reached with regard to the common agricultural policy and cohesion policy as well."
"Naturally, there are still open questions, such as the EU Roma strategy."
"Through adopting this, the EU will, at last, accept official responsibility as well for closing the gap for the Roma."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the success of the Hungarian Presidency also means success for Europe."
"For precisely this reason, I ask you to continue to support the achievement of common objectives through your votes."
"Thank you for the floor, Madam President."
"Madam President, like Mrs Dodds, I had intended to speak about the economy, but the terrible, callous murder of a young Catholic police officer in Northern Ireland has sadly changed that."
"I think it is important that this House realises the enormity of this tragedy for the island of Ireland, and for the family affected by it."
"Mr Kerr had only finished his initial training in December; he was only 25 and a bomb exploded under his car."
"I was very touched by the comments of his mother yesterday on Mothers' Day, when she urged Catholics not to be deterred from joining the Police Service of Northern Ireland at a time when we are striving, as she said, for a neutral police force for the good of our country."
"She urged all Catholics not to be deterred by this murder."
"She said we all need to stand up and be counted and to strive for equality."
"Again I will quote her words in her sadness: 'We do not want to go back into the dark days again of fear and terror."
"We were so proud of Ronan and all that he stood for."
"Don't let his death be in vain'."
"Those who murdered him have still not admitted to it."
"Those who know the persons or others who committed this murder have a duty to come and to give evidence to the Police Service of Northern Ireland."
"Europe has supported the peace process, and it is our duty to continue to do that."
"(RO) Madam President, Romania has a law stipulating that teachers' salaries should be increased, because they are very low."
"This law was approved and voted on in the Romanian Parliament, but it is not enforced in any way at all."
"Teachers have won their rights in court, based on definitive legal judgments, but the government is unwilling to enforce this law."
"As a result, it is devising a new law which places a ceiling on teachers' salaries."
"This is not only a danger to democracy and an unhealthy way for the democratic institutions of a state to operate."
"It goes far beyond this."
"It jeopardises the objectives of the Europe 2020 agenda."
"We are all aware that in order to effect a sustainable recovery from the crisis, we need education and skills."
"In order to have an economy based on knowledge and research, we need young people who are very well trained, teachers who are very well paid and a strong, effective education system."
"(RO) Madam President, as a result of the incompetent administration and disastrous policy of economic vandalism pursued by the Băsescu-Boc regime, Romania's healthcare system, especially the health insurance sector, has reached subsistence level."
"Both the medical staff who work in this system and the patients who ought to benefit from it have reached the point where they are being treated beneath the level of decency and human dignity."
"There are solutions for improving and remedying this situation, but they are being ignored by the current government."
"The foundations were recently established for cooperation between family doctor trade union organisations and the Health Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, in the hope of achieving a better outcome at the future discussions with the Ministry of Health and the National Health Insurance Office."
"I wanted to draw the European Parliament's attention to this situation as, if these actions supported by the Romanian Parliament also fail, this will add further evidence to the catalogue of abuses of power in Romania, where the democratic principle of the separation of powers of state has ceased to apply."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to echo the concerns expressed last week by Crown Prince Felipe de Borbón, who carries the historic title of my region - the Principality of Asturias - when he received the Prince of Wales in Madrid."
"Prince Felipe quite rightly called on the governments of Spain and the United Kingdom to resolve the damaging Gibraltar conflict."
"This is an important reminder that I welcome, as I say, from the European Parliament."
"With Spain and the United Kingdom being exemplarily democratic Member States, Britain's continued occupation of the rock in the 21st century is intolerable."
"No occupation of a sovereign state by another is acceptable under law."
"The occupation of northern Cyprus - a region I have recently visited - in violation of the territorial integrity of Cyprus, is also clearly unacceptable."
"(SK) Madam President, the European Union wants to become the most competitive economy in the world."
"In order to achieve this, we must invest in our future, and in my opinion, our young people and their education are our future."
"It is said that whoever wants something looks for reasons, and whoever does not want something looks for ways to avoid finding reasons."
"In my opinion, the European Union is currently looking for reasons to say why we cannot put more funding into education, and we are often very fond of pointing out that we have a crisis and must deal with its consequences."
"As we are now discussing the next seven-year period in the EU and future funding and budgets, I think we should be asking an unambiguous question: how much do we intend to invest in education and in our future?"
"We also certainly need to hear what the Council and the Commission want to do in this area."
"Likewise, we cannot, of course, tolerate what is happening in some Member States, which are transferring funding from education into other areas, as is taking place in my own country, for example."
"In my opinion, this is not right."
"We must also realise that investing in the future is the only way to achieve what we really want to achieve."
"Madam President, I want to denounce today an act of aggression against one of the pillars of the European Union: the internal market and the free circulation of goods and people."
"Recently, the Catalan Meat Industry Federation and certain Catalan newspapers have reported that, in France, trucks coming from Catalonia have been attacked and damaged by French farmers."
"The meat products some trucks were carrying were completely destroyed by French pickets."
"These acts of aggression have been repeated twice since the beginning of 2011."
"The last incident happened just a few weeks ago, when French pickets stopped another lorry full of meat from Catalonia, assaulted the driver and then sprayed diesel over 20 000 kilos of fresh meat."
"This pressure by some French farmers' unions, destroying products coming from outside France, has had a very rapid impact on clients of the Catalan meat industry, as a result of which its sales have dropped by 50%."
"I have tabled a parliamentary written question to the Commission in the hope that the European Union will stop this unacceptable aggression."
"(HU) Madam President, in Europe, cultural diversity is a value which all of us must take action to defend."
"However, this has not always been the case."
"On our continent, there are numerous unique cultures which are threatened with extinction."
"The Csango Hungarians in the Romanian region of Moldova are one such endangered community as well."
"Recommendation 1521/2001 of the Council of Europe urges saving this Csango minority culture, while outlining specific measures."
"Although there have been steps forward in the matter over the last decade as a result of the recommendation, the situation is far from satisfactory."
"The Council of Europe does not have at its disposal the European legislation or a mechanism of accountability that makes compliance with this possible and which ensures the effective functioning of the European Union."
"The Council of Europe is ahead of the EU in many issues concerning the provision of human rights at a high level, but its recommendation and its treaties cannot achieve the desired effect."
"If the European Union takes the principle of honouring cultural and linguistic diversity seriously, which Article 3 of the EU Treaty also advocates, everything must be done to ensure that this principle is enforced in actual cases."
"Let us start with the Csango Hungarian culture in Moldova."
"(ES) Madam President, in January, the European Commission approved the strategy to tackle early school dropout as a key contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy to fight the school dropout problem across the entire European Union and reduce rates by at least 10%."
"Strangely, this strategy does not make any reference to disabled people, and this is why I would like to use this minute to make an appeal, since the education ministers of all the Member States will be meeting in Brussels on 2 and 4 May to discuss the global strategies around this issue."
"I would like to ask that the issue of disabled people be included within this strategy, because it is of fundamental importance for this group of people all over Europe to receive continuous education and therefore to be able to access the labour market."
"Article 24 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states that disabled people are not, under any circumstances, to be excluded from the general education system."
"The debate is closed."
"Role of women in agriculture and rural areas (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the role of women in agriculture and rural areas."
"Madam President, Commissioner, as Parliament's rapporteur for the own-initiative report on the role of women in agriculture and rural areas, it was my aim to conduct a broad public debate in order to give more visibility and weight to the important multi-functional role of women in rural areas."
"It remains a key task of European rural policy to achieve equivalent living conditions in all regions, preventing the one-sided development of heavily populated urban areas, so that, even in rural areas, people can look forward to staying put and making a successful life."
"The focus of the common agricultural policy (CAP) over recent decades has been on the positive economic development of agriculture and rural areas."
"In future, it will be geared increasingly to shaping and furthering future-oriented rural areas."
"This will require fresh efforts and new strategies by all concerned."
"It will be more necessary than ever to take account of the needs of women in rural areas and to utilise their potential."
"Experience shows that, in rural areas most particularly, quality of life and economic strength are linked to the presence of women and their involvement in a wide range of activities."
"It has become apparent in recent years that significant advances for rural societies generally result from support for women and women's projects."
"Findings to that effect have been gleaned from experience with such support under the second pillar of the CAP and various other EU funding schemes in all regions of Europe."
"However, women also have an essential role to play in agriculture."
"This is a sector where women have made a substantial contribution in recent years to business diversification and adjustment to the market, thereby advancing the practical outworking of the sector's multi-functionality."
"In addition to their own food production, agricultural businesses also offer innovative products and services."
"The types of economic potential represented here can be utilised to an even greater extent."
"In this context, there are opportunities to provide practical support measures for women in agriculture."
"Greater account must be taken of the wide range of vocational skills, interests and achievements of women."
"To that end, we call, in particular, for women to have a full share in the resources that underpin farming as a way of life and a type of business."
"Women farmers want a share in rights and duties that is commensurate with their co-responsibility for the farm business, including through the appropriate representation of interests on agricultural bodies."
"Ensuring adequate social cover for all women who work in agriculture is essential."
"Following an intensive dialogue, we succeeded, in our vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, in adopting the report with only one vote against."
"No amendments have been tabled for tomorrow's vote in plenary."
"That indicates to me that we have found a very good compromise that is acceptable to all groups."
"A unanimous vote would give the report the necessary weight for it - I hope - to receive sufficient consideration in the Commission and the Council."
"I would like to thank my fellow Members, especially the shadow rapporteurs, for their truly excellent cooperation."
"The important role of women in agriculture and rural areas must not be overlooked in the forthcoming debate on the future of the CAP post 2013."
"I am confident that our report will provide an important basis for this essential debate and that it will also make a positive contribution to the forthcoming financial debate."
"Madam President, I congratulate Elisabeth Jeggle for her good work in this report and for her continued work in this area over the number of years I have known her."
"It is a compliment to her work that there are no amendments tabled to this important report."
"In the short time I have, I want to draw attention to several paragraphs in it."
"I welcome paragraph 4 about the importance of an adequate budget for agriculture in general, and paragraph 10, about new technologies in rural areas and the need to widen the access to broadband."
"I think paragraph 34 is particularly important."
"Women ought to be adequately represented in all political, economic and social bodies in the agriculture sector so that decision-making processes are informed by both male and female perspectives."
"That is really important, and I regret to say that the face of farm organisations is unfortunately all too male."
"We do need to look at that issue."
"Lastly, the Commission needs to be aware that the problem for male and female farmers at the moment is the uncertainty over the debate on CAP reform."
"I worry that some farmers are trying to second guess the outcome of those reforms and that they may be taking on additional costs, which will be a burden to them."
"I would ask you to bring that message to the Commission."
"(RO) Madam President, the main concern of women in rural areas is the lack of jobs."
"The lack of jobs means low incomes for the elderly, which, in turn, increases the risk of poverty."
"In addition, children's education and healthcare services in rural areas are the lifeblood of these communities."
"The precarious nature of the basic infrastructure in the countryside means that entrepreneurs show less interest in developing farms and production units in these areas."
"I urge Member States to use the Structural Funds to remedy the lack of basic infrastructure in rural areas and to implement policies for improving access to the public infrastructure for everyone."
"I call on the Commission and Member States to abide by their commitment to improve the broadband infrastructure in rural areas as a means of boosting their competitiveness."
"Rural tourism based on family tourist enterprises creates jobs, makes it possible to combine family obligations with work, and encourages the rural population to remain in the countryside."
"Madam President, I welcome this timely report from Elisabeth Jeggle and thank her for her good cooperation."
"Not many people realise that 42% of those engaged regularly in agriculture are women, and that three out of every ten holdings in the EU are managed by women."
"In order for women and families to remain in the countryside and make their contribution to achieving the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy through agriculture, there must be a range of services and facilities for normal everyday life."
"These services should include such things as healthcare and care services, education, leisure, transport and broadband."
"It is crucial that all services are not just market-oriented."
"There also needs to be proper social insurance for women working in agriculture so that their future and their pensions can be guaranteed."
"It is also important for women's entrepreneurial skills to be facilitated and, across the board, for women to be involved in decision making at local and regional level, in farm organisations and, indeed, in all decision-making bodies."
"That will have a huge impact and will help ensure women's future role in agriculture."
"(PT) Madam President, the situation of women in agriculture and the rural sphere reflects and is being damaged by the deep crisis into which current policies, such as the common agricultural policy (CAP) and others, have plunged rural areas."
"Women represent 42% of agricultural workers in all countries of the European Union."
"The great majority of these women work on family farms."
"They are thus particularly affected by the closure of hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized farms and by the process of destruction of family farming that has resulted from successive CAP reforms."
"They are also, as in other areas of activity, hit particularly hard by unemployment, insecure jobs, low wages and poverty."
"All of this is exacerbated by the antisocial policies imposed under the pretext of the crisis."
"Fine words and declarations of good intentions are therefore not enough."
"A break with these policies is required, ascribing value to the roles of women, to their rights and to equality, and ascribing value to and strengthening, among other things, the network of services relating to rural resources, health, education and family assistance."
"It is also necessary to make cultural and leisure activities available, and to combat the various asymmetries and desertification."
"(RO) Madam President, I personally believe that the most important sections in the report are those about living conditions in the countryside, and I would like to make a few remarks on this point."
"Firstly, there is the important role played by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development in modernising villages."
"This fund must be financed adequately and as part of the future common agricultural policy to help narrow the disparities between rural and urban areas."
"Secondly, I believe that we need to start, especially in the new Member States, with modernising the basic physical infrastructure."
"This must remain, without fail, a component of the EAFRD."
"My last comment concerns the ageing of the rural population."
"I would like to emphasise in connection with this point the importance of the programmes aimed, on the one hand, at the early retirement of farmers and farm workers and, on the other, at setting up young farmers in business."
"(RO) Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Jeggle for the approach she has adopted in this report."
"I feel that it is vital to recognise the significant role played by women in agriculture, both in primary production and in the diversification of economic activities on farms and in rural areas."
"I believe that we need to draw attention to the high level of poverty and isolation which affects women in the countryside, thereby emphasising the need for effective measures to guarantee equal opportunities for women in agriculture as a main objective of the common agricultural policy."
"In this context, it is essential to improve the quality of life of women living in rural areas by providing them with the easiest possible access to education and vocational training, lifelong learning, effective local public healthcare services, not to mention to the infrastructure and services for supporting children and families."
"I should emphasise that improving equal opportunities for women in rural areas involves promoting their role more actively, both in farming and in other areas of economic activity, including in protecting agriculture's multi-functionality."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as it was important to put this topic on the table."
"The Commission is very conscious of the essential role women play in agriculture and in rural areas."
"It can see that this is a task for the rural development policy."
"The rural development regulation provides for support in a number of areas which are important for women in rural areas."
"The setting up and development of micro-enterprises, adding value to agricultural projects and seeking sales outlets for them are only a few examples."
"The rural development policy also foresees possibilities to help men and women to balance family and professional life."
"For example, under the basic services measure, social facilities like day care centres for children or elderly people can be supported."
"In addition, local transport services and small-scale infrastructure are eligible for support."
"The situation in rural areas is very diverse across Member States, including as regards possibilities and requirements for women."
"Member States and regions have to carefully analyse the situation and design tailor-made measures linked to local conditions, taking account of the specific problems women face."
"For example, Member States can give preference to women with regard to certain measures."
"In addition, Member States can use financial engineering to set up guarantee funds in order to help women to get access to credit."
"Women should also play an important role in the LEADER Programme, where they should bring in their specific interests and their specific potential in order to mobilise the development potential of an area."
"The Commission agrees that it would be useful to have more data on the situation of women."
"However, especially in the light of Member States' call for simplification, it would prove difficult to convince them of additional reporting burdens."
"But for those data for which it is possible, statistics should be presented and analysed, broken down by gender."
"The Commission will include, where available, data on women in its progress report on the implementation of the strategic guidelines for rural development."
"One very important factor in taking women forward in agriculture and rural areas is the exchange of experience."
"In this context, I would like to draw your attention to the European Network for Rural Development and its constituent national networks."
"They can be used to learn from each other's best practices and it would be desirable if more women's associations made use of these existing networks in order to connect women in different rural areas with each other."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 5 April 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (RO) I come from Romania where a high proportion of the population live in the countryside."
"This is precisely why I am aware that it is absolutely imperative for us to focus greater attention on the status of women in these areas, taking into account the specific opportunities and challenges."
"As a member of the Committee on Culture and Education and of the Committee on Regional Development, I want to stress the need to provide a vocational training system which will offer women adequate training both as producers and entrepreneurs, especially so that we can therefore meet the Europe 2020 strategy targets."
"This can also be achieved by providing farmers with better access to broadband Internet services."
"Supporting entrepreneurial initiative among women can provide them with incomes supporting a stable way of life, thereby giving them economic independence."
"This will allow us to eliminate the impact of social exclusion and poverty, which have a disproportionate effect on women."
"In this very same context, we are also talking about the future reform of the common agricultural policy, as part of which we will need to give greater consideration to the role and needs of women in rural areas."
"Making living in the countryside and farming more attractive remains a challenge, but it can offer women in these areas real opportunities for economic and personal development."
"It is men who most frequently choose careers in the agricultural sector, but women have been present in rural areas since time immemorial and, unfortunately, their contribution has always been underestimated."
"Their consistent actions and long-term approach to many issues help improve the quality of life and work in rural areas."
"They are, however, very frequently not represented during the resource planning stage, and taking female farmers' needs into account in this respect could bring many benefits to rural communities."
"We should ensure that professional development opportunities are open to women in agriculture by providing real support in the form of education or also careers advice."
"It is important to promote rural areas to women as an attractive place to work, where it is possible to realise both family and professional plans."
"EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in the new Member States (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Marinescu, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the efficiency and effectiveness of EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in the new Member States."
"Madam President, the accession treaties of the three Member States, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Lithuania, included the request to decommission a number of nuclear reactors which no longer met the safety conditions and could not be upgraded in a cost-effective manner."
"The aim of the financial assistance provided by the European Union was not to cover the entire decommissioning cost."
"The assistance was intended for measures in the areas of decommissioning, maintaining and monitoring reactors after shutdown, waste treatment, waste and spent fuel storage and decontamination, and dismantling work, as well as in the energy sector (for the replacement of the production capacity of the decommissioned units, improving energy supply security and energy efficiency, and other measures contributing to the necessary restructuring and upgrading of the energy infrastructure) and dealing with the social consequences (providing support for plant staff in maintaining a high level of safety after closure and retraining staff for new decommissioning tasks)."
"Due to the fact that financial assistance was decided without any ceiling being specified, which even continued after decommissioning plans and strategies were drawn up, new, additional financial support could be provided."
"The European Union has provided significant sums of money in funding this activity, amounting to roughly EUR 2.8 billion between 1999 and now."
"The report calls for the following aspects to be clarified in the future evaluations carried out by the European Commission and the Court of Auditors of the European Union: whether the funds allocated by the European Union were used to ensure safe decommissioning; whether decommissioning guarantees the safe storage of nuclear waste; whether there was sufficient coordination between the three existing programmes so that the experience accumulated was used effectively and the model was followed, based on projects prepared and funded previously in order to achieve a reduction in costs; whether the current plans and strategies are complete or whether it is still possible to add new activities and provide additional funds later on; whether additional sums still need to be allocated to energy projects or whether attention needs to be focused on decommissioning projects; and whether financing for these activities still needs to be provided from EU funds."
"(SK) Madam President, the early decommissioning of nuclear reactors in the three EU candidate countries of Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria prevented the creation of appropriate national funds to cover all the costs connected with decommissioning the plants, and Community assistance was therefore essential for coping with the substantial financial and economic burden."
"Expert studies show, however, that the costs for taking the plants out of operation have already exceeded the level of planned assistance from the EU, and have probably exceeded the original estimates as well, although the actual decommissioning is still in the initial phase."
"The decommissioning will therefore have to carry on, ladies and gentlemen, even after the end of the financial perspective covering the period up to 2013, and I therefore consider it necessary to consider releasing further funds for the projects to decommission these three nuclear plants."
"(RO) Madam President, the European Union has 143 nuclear power plant units and, according to the data published by the Energy DG in March for 2010, nuclear energy accounts for roughly 28% of the European Union's energy mix."
"The events in Japan have sounded an alarm bell regarding the risks associated with nuclear power plants."
"Shutting down nuclear power plant units early and decommissioning them is a major financial and economic burden."
"This is why the European Union can provide financial assistance to the Member States affected, by which I mean Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria."
"The lack of funding for decommissioning measures will delay this process, which would pose a threat to the environment and human health."
"We urge the relevant national bodies to finalise their detailed decommissioning plans, as well as the Commission to report on this process, clearly describe the scope of the EU funding in these cases and provide a detailed long-term financial plan for the decommissioning projects."
"(LT) Madam President, I would like to congratulate my fellow Member and thank her for her cooperation in preparing this important report."
"When they joined the European Union, three Member States made commitments that were complex both economically and socially: to close their nuclear power plants for the first time, without having the required financial capacity or experience."
"The European Union really did show solidarity by committing itself to providing the required financial assistance, not just to fund decommissioning, but also to contribute to the development of alternative energy projects and towards mitigating the negative social impact of decommissioning."
"I agree that some issues still need to be addressed, such as the allocation of money to carry out specific decommissioning work, and Member States' complex administrative structures, which are perhaps preventing the allocated funding from being absorbed effectively."
"I believe that the European Commission should play a greater coordinating role in order to ensure the timely and safe closure of these nuclear reactors, to guarantee transparency as regards the use of funds, and to encourage these countries to develop alternative energy and create new jobs."
"(PT) Madam President, nearly half of European Union Member States have nuclear plants within their territory."
"Many of the reactors in operation are relatively old, which creates an acute need for some of these reactors to be dismantled for reasons of safety, and of defending and safeguarding public health and the environment."
"In the case of new Member States confronted with the requirement to decommission a number of plants, it seems only right to us that they be able to expect EU support to adequately and safely complete their decommissioning processes."
"These processes should include the necessary maintenance and supervision following closure; the processing, storage and decontamination of waste; the environmental upgrading of installations; and support in replacing the energy capacity of decommissioned plants, paying particular attention to environmental sustainability and energy efficiency."
"As the report rightly states, the social consequences of this process should be taken fully into account, guaranteeing the safeguarding of workers' jobs, together with all safety conditions before, during and after decommissioning."
"(SK) Madam President, the Marinescu report talks about the effectiveness and efficiency of EU funding spent on decommissioning Soviet-style nuclear reactors."
"The Slovak Republic completely rebuilt its nuclear plant at Jaslovské Bohunice after the accident at Chernobyl, fitting the most up-to-date safety equipment from specialised French and German firms."
"Following completion of the extensive modernisation, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that the Jaslovské Bohunice nuclear plant was ready for more than 30 years of safe operation."
"Nevertheless, for the peace and assurance of the citizens of neighbouring Austria, the Slovak Republic agreed during EU accession talks to the early decommissioning of the V1 and V2 reactors at Jaslovské Bohunice, which were fitted out to the highest standards."
"I see the symbolic contribution of the EU to the costs of taking these reactors out of production only as an attempt to compensate at least partly for the loss suffered by the Slovak Republic, which has been deprived of a powerful and efficient source of clean power, and not as a real contribution towards the removal of this plant."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission very much welcomes Parliament's own-initiative report on the efficient and effective EU funding of decommissioning of nuclear power plants in the new Member States."
"Nuclear safety is, and will remain, an absolute priority for the EU, and this is why the Commission attaches great importance to efforts that facilitate the safe decommissioning of nuclear reactor units that have been deemed not to be upgradeable to the necessary safety standards."
"Let me first say that we share with Parliament many of the views expressed in its report."
"We agree with the need for Member States to provide detailed decommissioning plans, as well as sound long-term financial planning."
"We also deem it essential for the funds, for the most part, to be allocated to decommissioning activities and for the Commission to have an important role to play in ensuring strict monitoring of the use of the funds."
"The Commission believes in a strict application of the 'polluter pays' principle, so we share the opinion of Parliament that it is up to the operators of the nuclear plant to ensure that financial resources for decommissioning are already allocated during the operational life of the plants."
"Decommissioning must be made as safe as possible, and sound, transparent and supervised management of decommissioning funds is crucial for this."
"It can also be noted, however, that the report focuses on the efficiency and effectiveness of EU funding in the area of decommissioning."
"The Commission was glad to see, in various parts of the report, that there is full recognition that the main objective of the EU funding was, first and foremost, to ensure that the reactor units were closed and remained so for nuclear safety reasons."
"We believe that having met this objective is an essential element to be taken into account when assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of EU funding."
"The Commission considers it important to clarify that EU support was never intended to cover the full cost of decommissioning, nor to compensate for all the economic consequences."
"EU support was aimed merely at contributing to compensation for the early stages of closure."
"The Commission also underlines that it is the Member State that bears full responsibility for the decommissioning of its nuclear installations."
"Providing detailed long-term planning is the responsibility of the Member States, which are equally responsible for establishing precise timetables and cost estimates for the completion of decommissioning."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur and Parliament for this timely debate on an issue which, in the context of Fukushima, has become more pertinent."
"Safe and complete decommissioning is a key element of nuclear safety, for which we aim at the highest standards."
"Parliament's report constitutes a valuable contribution to the discussion that the Commission will have with the three Member States concerned in view of assessing possible financial EU support beyond 2013."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 5 April 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (EL) The nuclear threat, as one of the consequences of the terrible earthquake in Japan and the tsunami that followed, makes the debate of the report by the Committee on Budgetary Control extremely topical."
"At the same time, however, it highlights the fact that the EU is monitoring and giving practical support, in the form of financial aid, to the necessary efforts to decommission nuclear power plants."
"The aim of these efforts is to ensure that nuclear power plants function properly and safely, so that we never see another Chernobyl or Fukushima and, at the same time, to address the impact of closure and decommissioning by meeting the energy requirements of the countries in which they operate."
"These efforts, which are accompanied by considerable financial support in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria, illustrate just how seriously the EU takes the question of nuclear safety."
"This is a carefully designed programme which started in 1999."
"The aim of this financial support is also to help improve the environment and modernise energy production, transmission and distribution, and to strengthen the security of energy supply."
"Evaluating the return on the resources made available and respect for their sound and transparent management are the factors that will guarantee that the objective is attained."
"The natural disaster in Japan and the nuclear disaster that followed in its wake have drawn attention to the importance of the topic."
"The effects of the disaster, as with Chernobyl, could last for decades and be a sad, unwanted legacy for generations to come."
"This case has also demonstrated that energy wastage must be reduced and the emphasis gradually placed on renewable energy."
"Today's report criticises on several points the financing of nuclear power plant closures in new Member States as regards transparency and implementation."
"In addition to the closure of the power plants specified in the report, I believe that it is extremely important to inspect all European nuclear power plants and, if need be, make them safer in order to prevent a similar disaster in the future."
"For this reason as well, I ask my fellow Members to discuss the motion for a resolution recently submitted by myself and my Austrian fellow Member in the interest of nuclear energy safety in the Danube region, as part of and within the scope of joint European cooperation."
"European international investment policy (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Arif, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the future European international investment policy -."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by sincerely thanking all those with whom I have had the opportunity to work on this issue."
"All the contributions have helped in the drafting of this report and, thanks to the cooperation of all the political groups, and I am especially grateful to the shadow rapporteurs, we have on the table today a consistent text that sends out a powerful message."
"Indeed, we are at a turning point in European investment policy and at a time when we have to seize the new power conferred on us by the Treaty of Lisbon in order to meet a dual challenge."
"Firstly, that of providing European businesses with the tools they need for high quality foreign investment that is protected by a legal framework providing long-term support."
"Secondly, Europe must strengthen its position as the world's leading beneficiary of foreign direct investment and give itself the means to control that investment so as to encourage sustainable development that creates high quality employment."
"By voting on this report, the first official expression of our institution since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, Parliament is fully assuming its role as a new colegislator in trade regulatory matters and is voicing its priorities at a time when the first investment protection negotiations are about to begin."
"This expression is essential, because it is intended to relay the concerns of the citizens, who are showing a growing interest in trade matters and whom we must support."
"In a world, today, where conflicts also take place in a trade context, protecting those businesses of ours that invest abroad must become a priority."
"International agreements have been created to protect investors from harsh, unjustified expropriations and hidden laws aimed simply at eliminating them from this or that market."
"This primary objective must be maintained."
"Although Europe is one of the most open markets in the world, a balance must be restored with our main partners so that European businesses can benefit from a level playing field."
"This is the proposal made in this report, which stresses the need for future agreements to include standards relating to non-discrimination, fair and equitable treatment, and protection against direct and indirect expropriation."
"However, those standards must be defined in such a way as to prevent any misinterpretation."
"Some businesses have, in fact, used the vague wording in first-generation investment agreements to protect their interests beyond what is legitimate, for example, by attacking new social and environmental laws that harm their interests."
"Appearing before international arbitrators and with no transparency or possibility of appeal, they have demanded considerable compensation by claiming that those laws are on a par with indirect expropriation."
"Europe, which, in the future, will receive ever more investment, particularly from emerging countries, must guard against such abuses."
"That is the idea behind the reforms undertaken by the United States and Canada, two countries whose governments and authorities have suffered several setbacks in international arbitration cases and which have radically overhauled their investment agreement model."
"By proposing new definitions of protection standards, the report strikes a fair balance between the protection of investors' rights and the right of public authorities to regulate."
"This also means including in all future agreements specific clauses laying down the possibility for public authorities to legislate and regulate in the areas of national security, the environment, public health, workers' and consumers' rights, industrial policy and cultural diversity."
"Lastly, increased protection for investors must be accompanied by more responsible behaviour, particularly in developing countries, where the social and environmental laws are less binding."
"That is why the report mentions that social and environmental clauses should be included in all free trade agreements signed by the Union."
"Furthermore, we must go beyond naming and shaming and include in all future agreements a set of clear corporate social responsibility rules with which businesses must comply and which are based on guidelines set by the OECD."
"If our aim here really is to shape the contours of a new European investment policy, then I call in this report for it to be exemplary and to promote investment which is sustainable, respects the environment and encourages good quality working conditions in Europe and in third countries alike."
"That is why this report, by the power vested in it by Wednesday's vote, must serve as a reference for all future negotiations conducted by the Commission."
"(RO) Madam President, according to Articles 206 and 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, foreign direct investment is an exclusive competence of the EU."
"The Commission has already compiled a list of countries which will be privileged partners for the negotiation of the first investment agreements: Canada, China, India, Mercosur, Russia and Singapore."
"We call on the Commission, Parliament and Member States to devise an integrated and coherent investment policy which will promote high quality investments and make a positive contribution to economic progress and sustainable development worldwide."
"We call for the European Union's future policy to promote sustainable investments which respect the environment and encourage suitable working conditions in the businesses targeted by investment."
"We urge the Commission to ensure reciprocity when negotiating market access with its main trade partners from the developed countries and the major emerging economies."
"Madam President, as rapporteur for air transport agreements between the European Union and third countries, such as Canada and Brazil, I would like to ask the rapporteur and the Commissioner how the link will be ensured between gradual access to the market and airlines and these international investment agreements."
"(SK) Madam President, in the report on future European international investment policy, the rapporteur has drawn attention to many open questions regarding potential EU agreements."
"The first job of the EU is to protect the public interest of EU citizens, whom it represents in the areas entrusted to it by the Member States."
"However, the state-protected public interest often collides with the interests of aggressive foreign investors, who are frequently more skilful in international arbitration than the countries defending the interests of their citizens."
"The examples mentioned in the report of Argentina, the US and Canada provide concrete proof of this."
"There is, therefore, a real need to define the principles of protection precisely in order to prevent them from being interpreted incorrectly by various investors."
"However, this important and as yet unresolved question continues to be the international responsibility of the EU, particularly from a financial perspective, as it is not clear who would bear the financial burden of a judicial dispute lost by the EU."
"The Council of the European Union has not yet given a proper answer to this question."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission welcomes Parliament's report on the future European international investment policy."
"It is an important step that paves the way for the implementation of the new EU exclusive competence on investment."
"As you know, investment is a new frontier for the common commercial policy."
"We should seize the opportunity - we are in absolute agreement with Parliament on this - to build together an integrated and coherent investment policy that promotes investments and makes a positive contribution both to economic growth and sustainable development."
"The Commission also fully shares Parliament's statement that investor protection should remain the first priority of the European investment policy."
"We believe that the new policy should serve the purpose of assuring all European investors that they are able to operate in an open and properly and fairly regulated business environment, not only within the internal market, but also when operating in third countries."
"I also take note of Parliament's recommendation that the EU should draw on Member States' best practices found in their bilateral investment treaties."
"Indeed, the thrust of the Union's action in this area should be to deliver better results than those obtained by Member States individually."
"While aiming at high levels of protection for our investors, we should not compromise other objectives, such as the public capacity to regulate or coherence with other EU policies."
"The right of states and of the EU to take the measures necessary to achieve legitimate public policy objectives is a standing rule of the common commercial policy."
"It will equally apply to our investment policy."
"The dispute settlement regime and the related financial responsibility are also very important issues and we need to further reflect on them."
"Our objective, as mentioned in the communication, is to ensure transparency, consistency of rulings and make the system as productive as possible."
"We also need to address a number of issues which arise because of the EU's status under international law."
"We will take into account Parliament's views, as expressed in the report, when we analyse possible options and further ideas for a comprehensive approach to these issues."
"We will carefully consider all recommendations put forward in Parliament's report, while progressively developing and implementing our investment policy."
"The Commission has already tabled proposals for investment negotiating directives for Canada, India and Singapore."
"We want to seize opportunities for ongoing wider trade negotiations and to engage in comprehensive investment negotiations with those countries."
"Parliament's opinion is therefore very timely, to guide the Commission and the Council when we define final respective negotiation directives."
"Last but not least, I would like to assure you that, as the development of a comprehensive European investment policy is now a joint responsibility of all the institutions, the Commission will stand ready to cooperate with Parliament and the Council while respecting the division of competences among all the institutions involved."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 6 April 2011."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The enlargement, by the Treaty of Lisbon, of the EU's sphere of competence to include foreign direct investment means that a true European policy on this matter can finally be envisaged."
"At this stage of developing the policy, the priority is to provide as much certainty as possible both to investments and to investors."
"Therefore, the shift from a national competence to a European one should not, under any circumstances, disrupt the proper implementation of the 1 200 or so agreements in force between the Member States and third countries."
"Again, for the sake of legal certainty and predictability, the EU must now devise an effective, transparent dispute settlement mechanism that is accessible to all investors, including the smallest ones (SMEs for example)."
"The mechanisms integrated into the most recent bilateral trade agreements are a good foundation, but they only concern disputes between a state and the EU."
"Provisions suitable for a potential dispute between the EU and a company must be established."
"Lastly, the EU must seize this opportunity to go further: it must include in future agreements not only clauses facilitating the establishment of investors in these countries, but also basic provisions relating to social and environmental standards."

"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 09:05)"
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (announcement of motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes"
"Conclusions of the European Council meeting (24-25 March 2011) (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the President of the European Council: Conclusions of the European Council meeting (24-25 March 2011)."
"The President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, will take the floor."
"President of the European Council. - Mr President, President of the European Commission, honourable Members, within the space of 49 days, I have chaired 3 meetings of the European Council and a Summit of Heads of State and Government of the eurozone."
"These facts illustrate the great and urgent challenges our Union is facing, both on the economic and on the diplomatic front."
"It also neatly illustrates that meetings of the European Council are not just an event: they are part of a process."
"Indeed, in the meeting on which I am reporting today - that of 24 and 25 March - we duly approved a significant set of economic measures that have been prepared and discussed over the last year, we stepped up our action with regard to ongoing events in Libya and we initiated our response to the catastrophic events in Japan."
"Allow me to take each of those issues in turn."
"On economic issues, we took forward a comprehensive package of measures."
"Under the impulse of earlier meetings, including the informal eurozone summit of 11 March, we were able to bring together almost all the strengths of this endeavour."
"Of course, approving measures and procedures to deal with the crisis does not in itself take you immediately out of the crisis."
"This will require perseverance and sustained effort."
"I will not repeat all the decisions we took in detail."
"You will find them in the conclusions."
"However, let me summarise six key points."
"Number one: we agreed on the Treaty amendment needed to give full legal certainty to the permanent Stability Mechanism."
"In its resolution of 15 December, Parliament called for a light Treaty change that provides a legal basis for such a mechanism, rather than resorting to a profound amendment of the Treaty."
"We followed that advice, and I was delighted when Parliament endorsed the proposed Treaty amendment by such an overwhelming majority on 23 March."
"I am especially glad that we were able to reassure Parliament about some of the concerns that had been raised in this context."
"I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri, for working so closely with me to achieve this result."
"Number two: we reached a detailed agreement on the size, scope and mode of operation for the future Stability Mechanism and on improving the temporary facility."
"Number three: we endorsed the position of the Council on the six legislative proposals on budgetary and macroeconomic surveillance ahead of negotiations with Parliament."
"I know you are working hard on this; indeed, I met your rapporteurs and will be meeting your coordinators this afternoon."
"All those concerned understand the need to conclude by June."
"Number four: we started the European Semester."
"It is an exercise in which we follow up the implementation of the EU 2020 Strategy, the Stability and Growth Pact and macroeconomic surveillance."
"The European Council in June will draw the necessary conclusions."
"I will personally see to it that this does not sink into the sands of a bureaucratic process."
"Number five: we agreed that credible stress tests for the banks will take place soon."
"The task is double: the banks must do the test and governments must be ready to deal with the outcome of the tests."
"Number six: we provided for a new quality of economic coordination."
"We call it the Euro Plus Pact for two reasons: firstly because it is about what eurozone countries want to do more - they share one currency and wish to undertake supplementary efforts on top of existing EU commitments and arrangements; and secondly because it is also open to the others."
"That is why I am glad that six non-euro countries have already announced that they will join the Pact."
"They are Denmark, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Romania."
"It remains open for any of the four remaining Member States to join later on."
"Let me say once again that the political commitment of the Euro Plus Pact comes on top of all the other measures in the package to improve Member States' economic performance: the stronger Stability and Growth Pact on fiscal surveillance, the new macroeconomic surveillance and implementation of the crucial EU 2020 Strategy on structural reforms to achieve economic growth."
"The commitments in terms of competitiveness, public finances and pensions, employment and so on must be translated into the national reform and stability programmes."
"They will also be evaluated annually at the highest level."
"I have a final remark on the economy."
"Some people fear this work is about dismantling the welfare states and social protection."
"Not at all."
"As I said to the social partners at the Tripartite Social Summit, it is to save these fundamental aspects of the European model."
"We want to make sure that our economies are competitive enough to create jobs and to sustain the welfare of all our citizens and that is what our work is about."
"These, then, were the main elements of our global economic package to help us come out of the crisis."
"As I said, they are the result of a long process, not a single meeting."
"It was on 25 March 2010 that the European Council decided to improve European economic governance, launching the Task Force that I had the honour to chair."
"One year later, we are getting new rules, new instruments and more ambitious policies."
"It was, and remains, an effort of all institutions, including this Parliament and all the Member States."
"It was not always easy, not always without drama, but the political will has been unflinching, our sense of direction is clear and significant results are there."
"Not all our problems are over."
"They are the result of past mistakes and a lack of appropriate instruments both at the European and at the national level."
"But we now have every chance of dealing with them and not repeating them."
"I should now like to turn to the situation in Libya, which was, of course, something we discussed on 24 and 25 March."
"We showed common determination."
"I know that some among you had doubts, but we worked hard to secure concrete results."
"Two weeks previously, at an extraordinary meeting of the European Council on 11 March, we had adopted a clear line on Libya."
"Without that clear European position, the subsequent actions would not have been possible."
"We decided that, to safeguard the safety of the civilian population, Member States could examine all necessary options, provided that there is a demonstrable need, a clear legal basis and support from the region."
"Those three conditions were quickly met."
"The clear need was obvious when the regime stepped up the violence against its own people."
"The legal base was provided when the UN Security Council agreed the landmark resolution on Libya a few days after the European Council meeting."
"Regional support was immediately forthcoming from the Arab League."
"The actions undertaken by a coalition of European, Arab and North American countries implementing the UN resolution have helped protect the civilian population of Libya."
"A massive bloodbath has been avoided."
"Thousands of lives have been saved."
"This is the most important result and deserves the highest attention, more so than the decision-making process."
"The wood is more important than the trees."
"We all know that the decision to take military action was not easy."
"There are, quite naturally, questions and hesitations."
"That is perfectly normal in issues of war and peace."
"But any difficulties that we have experienced over that aspect of the Libyan crisis should not mask for one moment the full track record of the European Union."
"From the beginning of the crisis, the European Union was at the forefront."
"It was the first to impose sanctions, the first to impose a travel ban on leading figures in the regime, the first to freeze Libyan assets and the first to recognise the Interim Transitional National Council as a valid interlocutor, at the request of this Parliament."
"The Union also coordinated rescue efforts for EU citizens and has provided, and continues to provide, substantial humanitarian aid."
"The political objectives we set on 11 March remain unchanged."
"Gaddafi must go."
"We want a political transition led by the Libyans themselves and based on broad-based political dialogue."
"We stand ready to help a new Libya, both economically and in building its new institutions."
"We are also following the events in the rest of the region closely."
"Knowing that the situation is different in each country, we express our utmost concern at the situation in Syria, Yemen and Bahrain."
"We strongly condemn the escalation of violence and we support political and social reforms in our southern neighbourhood."
"We also have to change our policy, and I will be discussing this later today with several MEPs responsible for this region within Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"On the positive side, we noted the smooth conduct of the constitutional referendum in Egypt two weeks ago."
"Allow me to say a few words on Côte d'Ivoire as well."
"It was not on the agenda of the most recent European Council, but we adopted conclusions in December and have been closely following developments there ever since."
"First of all, we condemn the violence, particularly violence against civilians, in the strongest possible terms."
"This must stop on all sides."
"Secondly, the current situation is a clear result of the lack of respect for democracy."
"Democracy is not only about elections, but also respect for the outcome of the elections."
"The international community was clear about the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire last year."
"We must be consistent in our position."
"Finally, on Japan, turning to the accumulation of tragedies that had hit Japan, we as the European Council expressed our sympathy and solidarity for the Japanese people and our condolences for the thousands of victims."
"We must not forget them, even while other aspects of the drama in Japan are retaining our attention."
"We are ready as a Union to assist in any way we can."
"In these tragic days, as true friends of Japan, we reiterate the strategic importance of the EU-Japan relationship."
"As we know, the effects of the events go beyond Japan, and that is why the European Union is drawing all the lessons fully."
"We are paying close attention to the consequences for the global economy and to the nuclear aspects."
"That is a top priority."
"We therefore decided that the safety of all of our nuclear plants should be urgently reviewed in the 'stress tests' on safety."
"The Commission will report to the European Council on the stress tests before the end of the year."
"It will review existing EU rules on the safety of nuclear installations and propose improvements wherever necessary."
"In Europe, we want the highest standard for nuclear safety, because ensuring the safety of nuclear plants cannot stop at our borders."
"We encourage and support neighbouring countries to do similar stress tests."
"A worldwide review of nuclear plants would be best."
"Mr President, honourable Members, that concludes my summary of what we agreed at this, the third meeting of the European Council this year."
"Much of it paves the way for further work in this Parliament, be it through legislative procedures or through Parliament's general right of scrutiny over the common foreign and security policy."
"I look forward to hearing your views."
"Mr President, President of the European Council, honourable Members, the President of the European Council has given us a presentation on all the decisions made at last week's meeting."
"I would like to share my reading of these with you, and to talk to you especially about the next stages."
"I think it is fair to say that some very important structural decisions were made for the sake of greater financial stability in the euro area and greater economic coordination."
"This is a real turning point for European economic governance, especially if we look back at the road we have come down to get to this point."
"At last we have laid proper, solid foundations for the economic component of our economic and monetary union."
"I think it will now have a more stable basis."
"We now have a framework which will enable us to respond together to any crises that may occur."
"And last but not least, in assessing the results of this Council, we should not overlook the fact that the framework is in keeping with the provisions of the Treaty and adheres to a Community approach."
"As we all know, that was not a foregone conclusion."
"The Commission was at the forefront of the joint response to the economic crisis and the vision for Europe in 2020."
"It received vital support from this Parliament, and once again I would like to thank you for this."
"The stance that Parliament and the Commission have taken together to defend the Community approach have been acknowledged and have played an important part in obtaining these results."
"Our new economic architecture is now largely in place, therefore."
"However in itself, it is not a guarantee: political leaders will now need to make some important decisions in order to live up to it."
"Under this new framework, we will need to be determined in implementing without further delay the necessary public finance consolidation and structural reform priorities for growth that this European Council confirmed, based on the Commission's annual growth survey."
"I am confident that our determination over the coming weeks and months will be as strong as, if not stronger than, the determination we have shown until now in establishing the various components of our joint response to the crisis in a cohesive and coordinated way: the European semester, the Euro Plus Pact, the new strengthened economic governance framework and the steps we have taken in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility to maintain the euro area's financial stability."
"I do not mind telling you that the Commission would have liked to have gone further in several areas of economic governance, especially in relation to the euro area's new financial stability mechanism."
"For example, we would have liked greater flexibility."
"Nonetheless, I think we can say that we have succeeded in securing a mechanism that is anchored in the Treaty, with a strong role for the Commission and monitoring by this Parliament."
"The result we have obtained is significant and the approval for the amendment to the Treaty, which was so widely supported by this House, contributed to this."
"Honourable Members, the new governance structures must now be put into action to address the economic situation."
"The truth is that we are still in a difficult climate."
"The ball is now more in the courts of the Member States, which must finalise their national reform programmes and their stability, or convergence, programmes"
"The Commission will be waiting to receive concrete, ambitious proposals from each Member State for moving forward together towards the major Europe 2020 Strategy objectives: more jobs, more investment in education, training, research and innovation and a bolder approach to combating poverty and social exclusion."
"We are also waiting for them to present the measures they will be taking to correct the continuing macroeconomic imbalances and to improve competitiveness and growth for jobs."
"As soon as we receive these documents, we will be able to prepare our draft opinions and recommendations for each country, so that they can be adopted before the June European Council, which will mark the end of the very first European semester."
"I would like to emphasise that we all share a joint responsibility and it is important that everyone takes full ownership of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"The Europe 2020 Strategy remains the fundamental framework for Europe's reforms for growth and employment."
"Paragraph 6 of the European Council Conclusions could be mentioned in this respect."
"It makes the following very clear point: 'In implementing these policies, and in order to ensure wide ownership, close cooperation will be maintained with the European Parliament and other EU institutions and advisory bodies (ESC, CoR), with the full involvement of national parliaments, social partners, regions and other stakeholders'."
"I want to stress this point because as you know, one of the most frequent criticisms of the Lisbon Strategy was precisely a lack of ownership of the European economy reform programme."
"I hope that this time we will have benefited from the lessons we can learn from this process and will genuinely work hard on growth for employment at both European and national levels."
"As regards economic governance reform, it is now Parliament's task to progress towards final approval of the six proposals in the legislative package, and I hope that we will reach a bold result as quickly as possible."
"This is vital if the whole governance system is to be in place."
"I think, therefore, that we have many reasons to be pleased with the outcomes of the last European Council, but also many reasons to keep on working hard from now on, since the economic climate is still difficult and unpredictable, especially in terms of the social aspects, about which we are all very concerned."
"Over the next few weeks, the Commission will also be presenting its proposals on the Single Market Act."
"I am delighted that the Council devoted so much time to discussing the future of the single market and that it emphasised the vital role played by the single market in stimulating growth and employment and promoting competitiveness, by highlighting among other things the importance of easing the regulatory burden on SMEs in particular."
"We want to free up the single market's potential for growth."
"I would also like to draw attention at this point to the fact that the consolidation of public finances is not an end in itself, but a means to the end of stimulating fair, sustainable growth and generating jobs."
"While we are on the subject of fair growth, it is important to emphasise that the European Council also gave its verdict on the possibility of levying a tax on international financial transactions."
"I confirmed the Commission's intention to put forward some proposals concerning taxation of the financial sector."
"Indeed, we believe that everyone should contribute towards dealing with the crisis."
"Honourable Members, as you know, the Council also discussed the situation in the southern Mediterranean and in Libya in particular."
"The President of the Council has given us a very detailed report."
"I would simply like to mention that I had a meeting with the Tunisian Prime Minister yesterday."
"I reiterated our support for the democratic revolution and our readiness to help the Tunisian people in their quest for freedom, justice and social progress."
"I also mentioned in this context the matter of migration, which Tunisia and the EU must tackle jointly in a constructive spirit and one of genuine partnership, since it is a partnership for democracy and shared prosperity that we have proposed and that has been very well received by the European Council."
"There is another subject that the European Council dealt with, namely the crisis in Japan, in particular the nuclear situation."
"I also had a fairly substantial telephone conversation yesterday with the Japanese Prime Minister, who thanked the European Union for its actions."
"I reiterated our solidarity and told him that we would continue to stand alongside Japan."
"We also discussed the nuclear question."
"Prime Minister Kan informed me about the situation in Japan and the latest safety developments and signalled his readiness to cooperate with us in relation to the work to be done on nuclear safety in Europe and the rest of the world."
"There is obviously mounting public anxiety over the nuclear issue."
"We must address these anxieties and guarantee maximum nuclear safety."
"We must also act with complete transparency."
"'Stress tests' will therefore be carried out in nuclear power plants in Europe and the results will be made public."
"The Council has asked the Commission and the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group to decide on the scope and practical details of these tests, which will be carried out by independent national authorities."
"The Commission will also examine the regulatory framework on safety in nuclear power plants and by the end of the year will suggest any improvements that may prove to be necessary."
"Mr President, honourable Members, we must not disappoint the hopes that have been pinned on our capacity to act together for Europe's common good."
"This is what the Commission seeks to do on a daily basis, knowing that we can count on Parliament's support, and we will continue to do it and to perform our new duties to the full."
"Mr President, President of the European Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentleman, the last European Council has set our countries on the right track."
"By increasing the capacity of the Solidarity Fund and deciding to make it permanent, the 27 have once again demonstrated their commitment to the euro and the importance they place on solidarity between the more financially stable countries and those facing temporary difficulties."
"At the same time, the decision to seal a euro pact between eurozone countries, and further afield, is indicative of the political will of European leaders to draw lessons from the financial crisis."
"The fact that we share a currency forces us to be more coherent in our economic and social choices."
"The time when countries could set an atypical rate of taxation or specific social rules without first consulting their partners is long gone."
"The reason for this is simple: all countries should benefit from the solidarity of their eurozone partners."
"Yet our people will only accept this solidarity if they think that everyone is putting the same effort into managing public funds."
"In this respect, the euro pact is a major step forwards towards the convergence of our economies."
"My group strongly supports it, but demands - and I shall continue to demand - that it is implemented in the context of the Community method, under the auspices of the Commission, Mr President."
"You are taking the right steps, you have done some good work, but more needs to be done within this Community method under the auspices of the Commission."
"That is how we will build Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you know how stubborn I can be and I will repeat it as many times as necessary here so that no one forgets."
"Europe sets itself apart from the rest of the world with its model of the social market economy, a model which our fellow citizens are quite rightly proud of and which is based on the principle of solidarity, but one which is difficult to preserve in the face of globalisation."
"The question is knowing how to ensure its future is sustainable by striking a happy medium between the nanny state favoured by socialists, which we have seen almost bankrupt us, and that of excessive liberalism, the dangers of which we have seen with the financial crisis."
"Three things are needed to achieve this."
"Firstly, all our countries need to reduce their deficit; secondly, they need to adopt comparable budgetary, fiscal and social rules; and, thirdly, they need to invest together in innovation to boost growth, which to date is clearly inadequate."
"Indeed, we can only preserve and strengthen our model if we invest in growth sectors: green energy, nanotechnologies, biotechnologies, and so on."
"Without massive investment in innovation, without a genuine European plan, we are denying ourselves the ability to keep up with our competitors."
"Ladies and gentlemen, while our Heads of State or Government were meeting, 10 days ago, the Fukushima power station continued to be an issue of global concern and the insurgents in Libya were looking to Europe for strong action."
"On these two matters, our countries and the European Union have shown a great sense of responsibility."
"We have in fact offered Japan our nuclear expertise in what is an extremely difficult and worrying situation for that country, and also for the international community at large."
"There will no doubt be a pre-Fukushima and a post-Fukushima."
"Although unfortunately not there yet, my group wants the post-Fukushima to be a period of reflection and action, firstly to ensure that the rules governing nuclear safety are significantly tightened and, secondly, to further our efforts in the field of green energy."
"I agree with your approach to Côte d'Ivoire, Mr President."
"Turning lastly to the Mediterranean, I welcome the European Council's repeated call for Colonel Gaddafi to relinquish power, allowing for a new page in this country's history."
"What I want is for all our countries to come together and discuss a neighbourhood policy as ambitious and successful for the South as the one they were able to make in the 1990s for the East."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, if one listens attentively to the speeches of Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso, one might be reminded of a famous German song whose words go something like 'All hands on deck, but the ship is a wreck'."
"There is no problem - everything is fine."
"We have solved every difficulty to everyone's complete satisfaction."
"I for one am unable to fathom your reports in relation to the European Council."
"I can fully understand that you did not wish to come here with a negative report."
"If I were President of the European Council I would probably also be anxious to portray this permanent Congress of Vienna in the most dazzling terms."
"You mentioned Libya."
"What you failed to mention was the deep differences between Europe's two largest governments on this issue."
"There is no consensus between France and Germany on the Libyan question."
"The differences within the European Union with regard to one of the key international issues is an indication that not everything is under control."
"Mr Van Rompuy, we would have been better served if the results of this Council meeting had been available to us in 2010."
"If we had wanted to prevent the downward spiral of the last year, particularly in the euro area, then we should have taken the steps now implemented as long ago as spring 2010."
"We need to ask ourselves why these steps were not taken in spring 2010?"
"The answer is that in the European Council, the institution headed up by you, it is not the Community method, community spirit and shared objectives that determine what is discussed and agreed, but rather that national tactical interests ultimately play a greater role than common European interests."
"This is a particular problem for Europe."
"I would have liked to have heard something from you, Mr Barroso, explaining for example how it is that the party that you belong to and once led and that made you Prime Minister of Portugal has now caused a Portuguese government to fall which was implementing precisely the measures demanded by you and the Commissioner sitting next to you."
"(Applause)"
"We cannot accuse you of being responsible for this, after all you are no longer the party leader."
"However, I would have expected a clear statement from the Head of the Commission about jockeying at national political level and its negative impact on the European Union - after all the collapse of the Portuguese Government coincided precisely with the moment that the government resolved to do exactly what the stability framework required of it."
"This is no way to take Europe forward."
"Something that worries me greatly and that neither of you has mentioned is that we are always faced with exactly the same scenario prior to a European Council meeting."
"The Heads of State or Government have hardly agreed a measure to stabilise the euro or a particular member of the euro area in its draft conclusions, when some ratings agency in the City of London or in New York downgrades this country, always with the same result, namely triggering a wave of speculation against the euro."
"When will we finally have the courage to say: 'Europe is no longer going to be dictated to by these speculators'?"
"(Applause)"
"What do we tell the banks?"
"Mr Barroso, I am very pleased to hear you say that you have a proposal for the financial transaction tax."
"At present the European Central Bank is lending money at 1% to the same banks that then lend this money to Member States of the euro area at 10%."
"Nothing changes: those who caused the crisis continue to profit most from the crisis."
"That is why we need a financial transaction tax, so that we can make sure that these banks carry some of the cost of this financial crisis."
"Mr Barroso, you mentioned Europe 2020 - more employment, more investment, more research and training, more environmental protection - it all sounds just great: except that this is all to be achieved with less and less public investment."
"One result is that Europe 2020 and the Lisbon process are extremely positive developments, however they are bound to fail if we only cut budgets unilaterally in the context of Europe's economic development."
"What we need is the courage to make public investments."
"Take a look at the level of investment in the emerging states."
"Look at the level of public investment in India."
"Look at Brazil."
"Look at the other continents and the public funds invested there."
"Europe is cutting back to death, which is why we should declare a method of attaining our goals, namely the Europe 2020 objectives, as the legally binding basis in the 'six-pack' for economic governance."
"Governments will then undertake finally to do what they have been loudly promising, only to prevent development with their budgetary cuts - also achieved by cutting the EU budget itself."
"For this reason, Mr Barroso, I expect you and, more particularly, your Budget Commissioner Mr Lewandowski to produce a committed and ambitious draft budget for the EU that actually facilitates the developments that it demands."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Van Rompuy for this report on the Council, but let us be honest, I do not think that the crisis is over, and I do not believe that, with the measures we are taking now, it can be over."
"There is a heavy thunderstorm on our doorstep."
"What we have done in the European Union so far is to use stop-gaps: measures which may be necessary but are not in fact solving the crisis."
"We have given EUR 110 billion to Greece and EUR 67 billion to Ireland, and I am not including the EUR 24 billion for the Irish banks that we have just decided to provide."
"For the moment we have EUR 76 billion in government bonds which the ECB has purchased."
"I can tell you that it will continue to do that, because the emergency fund is not allowed to go on the secondary markets."
"This means that it will continue to do so."
"On top of that, the ECB has accepted EUR 100 billion of collateral to give liquidity to the banks in Europe."
"In total, that is EUR 400 billion that we have invested in this crisis in recent months."
"That is three times the budget of the European Union!"
"And the worst is still to come."
"On Thursday there will probably be an increase in interest rates in Europe -from 1% to 1.25% - which may worsen the situation."
"It is necessary to combat inflation, but on the other hand this is making the situation worse."
"So that is the situation: EUR 400 billion that we have invested."
"And have we solved the crisis?"
"No, we have not solved the crisis."
"What is necessary is a really bold and in-depth approach and we do not have that for the moment."
"In this regard I would like to quote Nout Wellink, the President of the Dutch national bank, who published his annual report a few days ago."
"He says three things about the outcome of our decisions and those of the Council in recent weeks."
"He says that the budget rules are not tight enough, the economic governance package is too little and the pact for the euro is in fact too weak because there is no mechanism to enforce it."
"I am not the one saying this, I am quoting Nout Wellink, President of the Dutch national bank, who is repeating exactly what Mr Trichet said last week."
"The third thing he mentioned is that financial supervision is being conducted on too national a basis."
"I think Nout Wellink is right."
"We can even add a number of other elements."
"The first is the EFSF and the ESM."
"The permanent and temporary rescue funds cannot work because they have a unanimity rule."
"If we keep this rule, it means that the entire eurozone will from now on be hijacked by eurosceptic governments and by eurosceptic political parties."
"Finally - and this is my message for today - we still have to clean up the European banks."
"The problem has not been solved and the economic recovery in Europe will not start if we do not first of all deal with that problem."
"Not only do they have the old products from the financial crisis still in their portfolios, but they now also have a number of bonds in their portfolios from problematic countries whose ratings are going down every day and at least every week."
"What I am asking is that Mr Barroso and Mr Trichet come forward as quickly as possible with a global response on that issue, namely a bolder Stability Pact - and Parliament is working on that - and economic governance."
"Is there real economic governance?"
"What we have now is an intergovernmental approach without a sanction mechanism and that will not work."
"It has not worked in the past and it will not work in the future."
"We must come forward with a proposal to abolish the unanimity rule in the rescue funds, because it cannot work."
"We are in fact giving all the power to the countries and the parties who are against the system."
"Finally, we have to come forward with a plan for the European banking sector."
"We will not have economic recovery before you have put on the table a European mechanism to clean up the banks."
"We all know that will take money."
"Recapitalise the European banks, finance investment in Europe - as has been requested by Mr Schulz - and at the same time cover the bad public finances of a number of our Member States."
"How will we do that?"
"Where is the money?"
"The only way to find the money is to create a real European bond market, and we know it."
"Creating a European bond market is the only way out of the crisis."
"I would like to say to Mr Barroso that now is the time for him to deliver."
"Time is running out and it is not only with a pact for the euro that we will solve the problems."
"Mr President, President of the European Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I must confess, Mr Van Rompuy, that Mr Schulz has quoted a little German song to you."
"The direct equivalent in French is known as 'Tout va très bien, Madame la Marquise, il n'y a pas de problème'."
"I have to say I am astonished at how things are presented here."
"We should not be taken for fools."
"Even if we like listening to you, we do read the papers now and again, so we do know what happened at this Council."
"Do not be telling us little stories."
"We know what the problems are."
"We are not here to waste our time."
"I would like to say one thing to you and to Mr Barroso."
"You harp on about 'stability, growth, employment, competitiveness'."
"That much is true."
"But do you know how that comes across to our citizens?"
"What they see are 'inequalities, a feeling of injustice, insecurity'."
"That is how it translates for them."
"And if the European Union does not change its ways, does not try to respond to this feeling of injustice, this feeling of inequality or the reality of inequality, the reality of insecurity, well the people will hear 'competitiveness' and understand it as 'they are going to hit us again'."
"That is where the real problem lies for us, because citizens will see the mechanisms to bail out the banks, which might I add are necessary, and think 'well it is alright for the banks'."
"Look at the banks' profits."
"Look at the massive pay packets."
"People will say: 'This is totally insane!"
"All that money is spent and yet it is the citizens and national budgets that will suffer as inequalities are heightened only further.'"
"In recent years, all the statistics point to the fact that inequalities are growing."
"If we fail to address this problem, citizens will turn their backs on us, fuelling the extreme right anti-European wave across Europe."
"And they would have good reason to: because we are not capable of responding to this feeling of inequality, injustice and insecurity."
"So, if we do not respond, we will not succeed."
"As far as Eurobonds are concerned, as mentioned by Mr Verhofstadt, what we need to tell citizens and what we need to mobilise is indeed a defence fund, but if we have no investment fund, if we can show no real evidence of wanting to get the machinery going again - and that is why we need Eurobonds not only for defence but also for investment - well, if we do not go down that road, citizens will fail to understand anything and in particular this policy."
"Some things therefore need to be said: regarding inequalities, why is not possible for certain social measures that citizens actually understand to be adopted in Europe today?"
"For example, deciding on a minimum wage across Europe, not necessarily the same level, but merely introducing the concept of a minimum wage."
"It is unbelievable that in a country such as Germany, with all its talk of economic rebalancing, there is no mention, no talk of this problem."
"It is unbelievable that Germany, one of the few more profitable countries in Europe today, is incapable of introducing a minimum wage for its citizens."
"It is something that should be raised in the context of the economic and social governance of Europe."
"Turning to Libya now."
"What Mr Schulz said was right, albeit dramatic."
"You have a country such as Germany hiding while the other countries try and find solutions."
"On this point only do I agree, and only just."
"What I would like when we now discuss a neighbourhood policy is for us to take stock of the many past blunders we have made in respect of this neighbourhood policy."
"What were our relations like with Mr Gaddafi before the bombing began?"
"What relations did European countries have with Mr Gaddafi, Mr Ben Ali, Mr Mubarak?"
"Let us finally make an assessment of what those articles on human rights, in the association agreements, meant to us."
"Zilch!"
"Nothing!"
"If we are not going to make this assessment, well then we should stop lying to ourselves."
"Did the European Council devote even five minutes' thought to what we failed to do previously in our policy on the Mediterranean?"
"Did you think about that?"
"I have not read anything in the papers."
"I have heard nothing about what you said on this matter."
"If only the European Council were capable of a bit of self-criticism over its past failings."
"And finally, I turn to Japan."
"The problem is that the best form of nuclear safety is to phase it out."
"There is no zero risk when it comes to nuclear power."
"This cannot be achieved overnight, but if we do not phase out nuclear power, we will never be safe."
"The problem is nothing to do with stress testing one incident."
"The problem, as stated by Mr Lacoste, the head of France's Nuclear Safety Authority, is the cumulative effect of several possible incidents - something which, unbelievably until now, has never been looked at."
"That is what has happened in Japan."
"It is not just one incident, it is the accumulation of four or five incidents, plus human error, that have led to this situation"
"Mathematically speaking, it is not possible to guarantee this safety."
"If we Europeans do not speak out ... it will not be phased out overnight, but if we do not phase out nuclear power, we must stop talking about nuclear safety."
"There is no such thing as nuclear safety."
"Mr President, the most important topic at the recent European Council was the economy and the stability of the eurozone."
"You are well aware that most of the MEPs in the group of the European Conservatives and Reformists are from countries outside the eurozone, and most are from countries that have not even joined the pact for the euro."
"However, this does not mean that we want the eurozone to fail."
"On the contrary, we want a stable and prosperous European Union, including the eurozone."
"We want responsible national governments which will end debt, reform the structure of public spending and embark on fiscal reforms, thereby bringing about a restoration of the financial discipline we consider to be correct."
"What we do not consider to be correct and what bothers us is the hidden agenda promoted here by some Member States and partly by the Commission and some groups of MEPs as well."
"It is an attempt to take advantage of the crisis for a further transfer of sovereignty."
"It is an attempt to go further towards fiscal and tax harmonisation."
"It is an attempt to take a further step towards the creation of fiscal union, and therefore towards full political union."
"We say 'no' to such a union."
"We do not support such a union."
"I have been sitting here since 2004, and whenever there is a problem I hear the same old phrase: 'We need more Europe, we need a more Community-based approach'."
"I say that is not what we need."
"It is the attempt to solve everything at the European level that has got us into this mess - and how will we tackle it?"
"At the European level again. I am asking you to understand, at last, that the current model of European integration has run out of steam."
"You need to stop living in the 50-year old dream of post-war European integration from the last century."
"The European paradigm has changed, and the sooner some of you come to terms with that, the better it will be."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, my Group finds the results of the Council meeting inadequate."
"Firstly, let us consider economic policy."
"We have articulated our thoughts on the agreed guidelines in the area of economic policy in a hearing held last week."
"What we need is to overcome the neo-liberal practice of profit and competition fixing, evident in terms such as 'flexicurity', adjustment of retirement age, and so on."
"We believe that there is a need for democratically legitimised, controlled economic policy management that will prevent tax, wage and environmental dumping practices through appropriate common minimum standards that will provide effective regulation for the financial markets and prohibit the privatisation of profits, while at the same time passing on the risks to the public at large."
"My second point relates to our southern neighbourhood and Libya in particular."
"The EU Member States have become involved in a macabre situation in North Africa, particularly in Libya."
"We have already heard some criticism here."
"I would just like to emphasise one point: the dictator Gaddafi is using weapons purchased from us against the demonstrators and rebels."
"He is under fire from NATO troops apparently in order to protect those fighting for freedom and democracy, who are also using European and US weaponry."
"I would like to know the point of the existing code of honour in relation to arms dealing if such a situation can exist?"
"Where is the support for freedom, human rights and the fight against social injustice in specific cases such as Lampedusa, where hundreds of refugees are arriving from North Africa every day?"
"I fear that the newly cobbled together neighbourhood concept is more about European interests than an appropriate response to the needs of the partner countries."
"My third point relates to Japan."
"We still have time to discuss Japan this afternoon and tomorrow."
"Here too we fail to recognise a coherent European approach, at least as far as safety controls, the so-called stress tests, are concerned."
"I am not surprised that our citizens are asking with justified scepticism what exactly the European Union's position is on this issue."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, I would like to go back to the matter of Libya if I may."
"When did the political class and the great and the good suddenly catch up with the fact that Colonel Gaddafi is an evil man?"
"When, since that wonderful photograph with you embracing him, Mr President, did you suddenly come to realise that he was a ""wrong'un”?"
"I can tell you that the victims of Lockerbie in Scotland and the victims of IRA atrocities in my country knew very well what sort of scoundrel this man was."
"But he has got oil and he has got money so you all turned a blind eye, didn't you?"
"Well, the chickens have come home to roost."
"The most absurd figure in all this is the British Prime Minister, who stands there rattling his empty scabbard - having disestablished the Royal Navy, having disestablished the Royal Air Force - making threats from the sidelines, with no aircraft carriers, nothing, and calls himself a Conservative but is just a superannuated schoolboy whistling in the dark."
"We talk a great deal about violence against the people, we talk a lot about democracy."
"And yet we have had a homicidal baboon in Zimbabwe for years now, and we do not do anything about it, do we?"
"We do not care because there is no money and there is no oil."
"That is so typical of this place: full of hypocrisy and humbug."
"(NL) Mr Barroso, you will get your way."
"There will be a permanent support fund for the euro, a fund that will support Member States that have plundered their national exchequers and that will transfer the risks to those Member States that keep their own houses in order."
"Most economists agree with us that this fund will not rescue the euro any more than the arrangements under the Stability and Growth Pact were able to."
"It is a soft agreement that rewards weak and fraudulent Member States with easy credit."
"Where will that money come from?"
"How is the fund to be made up?"
"On paper, every Member State will contribute to the fund, including Ireland, Greece and Portugal."
"Yet these countries do not have any money."
"What it comes down to is that those Member States that have kept their own houses in order will end up paying."
"Dutch citizens will end up picking up the tab for weak Member States such as Greece and Portugal - your country, Mr Barroso - and that, Mr President, is unacceptable."
"That is not solidarity, it is rewarding the bad behaviour of a number of weak Member States at the expense of hard-working Dutch, German and Belgian citizens."
"The euro cannot be rescued in this way."
"Instead, these countries should be removed from it."
"Greece must get the drachma back and Portugal must re-introduce the escudo."
"Some countries must accept that they will have to leave the euro area and they have themselves entirely to blame for that."
"(DE) Mr President, the results of the summit meeting were an important interim step, however the true test is yet to come."
"If these results are handled like everything else, including the Stability and Growth Pact, and if the Member States do not adhere to them, then they are not worth the paper they are printed on."
"That is why I cannot share the optimism of the two Presidents that the crisis is over."
"I believe we are only now facing into the real test."
"It is more than two and a half years since the collapse of Lehmann Brothers and where are we now?"
"It has taken us two and a half years to reach this point."
"The responsible Commissioner rejected the proposals for a financial market transaction tax the last time they were brought forward."
"I want to see results."
"When I think back to the last parliamentary term, I recall that this House passed 12 resolutions on measures in relation to the financial markets and that the responsible Commissioner for the Internal Market - who thankfully is no longer in office - rejected them all."
"That is the reality."
"The Commission did not provide leadership in resolving the problem."
"However, we found that national self-interest needs to be overcome at Council level too and that Parliament needed to fortify the Commission in its role in amending the Constitution."
"There is absolutely no reason to rest on one's laurels."
"I must concur with Mr Verhofstadt."
"Budgetary consolidation is too lax, governance too non-committal, the euro pact too weak and national interest still too strong."
"If we do not have the courage to demand greater commitment to Europe from national governments, then we will never achieve a meaningful, lasting solution."
"Mr Barroso, I was critical when the Greek Members of my group voted against the programme for Greece."
"I certainly do not agree with Mr Schulz."
"If a socialist head of government is voted out of office, this is prima facie a good thing."
"However, in the Portuguese case your party also voted against the programme."
"Things like this should not be allowed to happen in Europe."
"I would ask everyone to play their part in ensuring that this partisan national attitude has no future as we work to solve this problem."
"(PT) Madam President, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, there is a question that the European public is asking: will the European Council make the necessary choices and will they be the right ones to get us through the crisis?"
"Many Europeans may think that the choices are along the right lines, but are slow and not very ambitious."
"Those who have seen the documentary Inside Job will be angered by such greed and lack of scruples, and will be asking: if credit rating agencies (CRAs) operate in this way, what is Europe doing towards establishing independent and reliable CRAs?"
"President Barroso said not long ago that, if a Member State can avoid having recourse to outside aid, then it should do so, as outside aid is costly."
"That is also the opinion of the Portuguese Government."
"Portugal does not need outside aid: it only needs financing for its economy and its families at reasonable interest rates."
"However, as CRAs serve the interests of speculators, the result of the enormous sacrifices that the Portuguese are making is going directly into the pockets of these speculators."
"Is this European justice?"
"Do political decision-makers not realise that we are going through a crisis of the euro area; I repeat, of the euro area: that attacks on the sovereign debt of some countries could undermine the euro, and jeopardise the single currency and the European project itself?"
"This is a European problem, which requires a European solution."
"If we are to come through the crisis, we need more Europe rather than less Europe; we need to measure up to our past and to the challenges of the future; we need to give confidence and hope to the European public, without whom there is no European project."
"(FR) Mr President, President of the European Council, President of the Commission, you have painted a rosy picture of these talks."
"There are some positive aspects, but I have no need to go over them again."
"I do, however, have one concern that goes beyond technical detail and what you have told us."
"I am talking about the North-South divide that is currently taking root in the European Union."
"As was the case just moments ago, we have heard people claim that some are right and others are wrong, that some are good while others are bad, and they seem to have forgotten about interdependence."
"This is serious."
"What is more, by refusing to deal with the issue of the banks, which Mr Verhofstadt mentioned, I think that a number of countries in the North, who preach a great deal to countries in the South, are viewed by many as refusing to see what their own responsibilities are."
"I therefore believe that if there is one task that falls to you, President of the European Council, and to you too, Mr Barroso, it is to prevent this divide from growing and becoming entrenched at all costs."
"We need solutions that are acceptable to everyone."
"We need to ensure that everyone shoulders their responsibilities."
"One last point: I find the European Council extremely inward-looking."
"The whole of this discussion has taken place as if the euro were of no global importance."
"There is nothing about external representation of the euro area in the IMF."
"France, which is currently chairing the G20, wants to promote the idea of global monetary reform and there is no proposal, like that of the Eurobonds which we are trying to push, that would attempt to make the euro a truly global currency."
"(FR) Mr Van Rompuy, I have a great deal of respect for you as a person and for your work, but I must tell you that you have not really convinced me."
"You say that workers should not worry, that we are working for them."
"When I read the section on competitiveness in the 'Euro Plus Pact', as you call it, my understanding is that it talks about wage cuts, about greater flexibility and less security."
"Nothing is said about productivity or our resources."
"Nothing is said about energy productivity."
"What I am saying is that we will never win the race against China when it comes to cheap labour."
"By contrast, China is well on course to beat us when it comes to energy efficiency and resource efficiency."
"What, then, will be left for Europe in terms of competitiveness if we cannot compete in those areas?"
"You are telling us that those on benefits should not worry."
"Yet when balancing public finances, a reasonable objective, you say that cuts need to be made."
"Forty per cent of public spending goes on welfare and you are telling us not to worry."
"You also tell us that revenue is being taken care of."
"Let us talk about revenue."
"The CCCTB, the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, is a real joke."
"You talk about it in the conditional tense; you say that it should in any case be neutral in terms of revenue."
"Therefore no extra euros will be gained from it, and what is more, companies will be able to choose, anyway."
"I have never seen anyone choose the most expensive fiscal option."
"On the other hand, if anyone should be free from worry it is the banks' shareholders and creditors."
"You talk to us about stress tests."
"Those last year were a joke."
"I do not know whether we will see the same tasteless joke this year."
"What we can be sure of, however, even if these stress tests are serious, after all, is where the funds for the banks will come from."
"Will they come from their shareholders or from us, the taxpayers?"
"Be serious!"
"Anyway, they obviously have nothing to worry about."
"Finally, nothing has been said of the elephant in the room, namely the absolute unsustainability of the Greek debt and the Irish debt."
"You know, no matter how much you want to skirt the issue, there is no way they can pay it back."
"And the later we restructure, the more painful the exercise."
"It is never going to be a pleasant exercise, but if you wait it will cost us dearly."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, every time the EU is confronted with a specific problem, it falls into the trap of devising a complex, bureaucratic, heavy-handed solution which is often completely disproportionate to the severity of the issue."
"This is the mistake that we are now making with regard to the current financial crisis: it is serious, it does require action, but many of the proposed solutions will have far-reaching and, in my view, highly damaging effects for the long-term future of Europe."
"The opportunity is being seized on by many to launch plans for permanent economic governance, with intervention and control as its guiding principles."
"The solution, we are told, is firstly to abuse the existing rules such as Article 122 of the Treaty, which was never intended for the bailouts that it has been used to pay for - my hope is that some country will have the courage to challenge this in the European Courts - and to impose more limitations on our Member States, which in reality means constraining the democratic choice of many of the electorates."
"If you look at the case of Ireland, that country has tried its very best to stabilise its banking system - stabilisation, incidentally, which is desperately needed by banks and institutions in other Member States, which would otherwise be terribly exposed - and Ireland's reward for that is to face demands from other Member States to increase its own rates of corporation tax in order to compete with the bloated situations in other countries."
"It is unjust and it is undemocratic."
"(GA) Madam President, what kind of thinking brings the Council and the Commission to believe that the policies imposed on Ireland will not increase debt or that this will not be the result of the implementation of those or similar policies across the EU?"
"The measures agreed at the summit will force all Member States to be confined to an economic logic that is to the detriment of the people - a logic in which cuts are necessary and which deprives Member States of the ability to promote growth."
"The policies being imposed on Ireland by the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) mean savage cuts, loss of jobs, and a significant reduction in public services."
"Ireland's debt burden is not sustainable."
"Unless bondholders are made to shoulder some of the deficit burden, Ireland will default in the future."
"Madam President, the Euro Plus Pact aims at strengthening and enhancing European competitiveness, but how can we achieve a European added value economy when our labour market is being violated by illegal immigration and our European products are being replaced by contraband products imported from labour-intensive countries in the East?"
"The sooner we identify and protect our geographical and economic products from the European Union the better."
"So my proposal is that we incorporate the identification and protection of the economic and geographical borders of Europe within the Euro Pact, otherwise we will not be able to achieve a competitive Europe within a very strongly aggressive competitive global economy."
"(NL) Madam President, if the crisis in Libya illustrates anything well, in my opinion it is primarily the total lack of a serious European geopolitical strategy to secure European interests."
"It is, after all, a sad truth that we are there predominantly as a result of a domestic political agenda on the part of President Sarkozy, who allowed himself a kind of Falklands moment."
"In any case it is still strange that those - including some in this Chamber - who so fiercely and righteously rage against the absolute evil that is Colonel Gaddafi were all too happy, up until very recently, to get photographed, all smiles, at the side of the Libyan dictator, who they received with military honour."
"All I want to say is that it is easier to fire on Gaddafi today than to provide an answer to the enormous questions that will arise."
"To mention just one of these, are we going to further arm the rebels - the collective term for a diverse bunch of people, some of whom by European standards have not yet mentally outgrown the Middle Ages - and if so, what guarantee do we have that such weapons would not be used to plunge the country into greater chaos, as happened in Iran after the Shah was expelled?"
"Personally, I would like these European efforts and muscle to be somewhat more visible in the military guarding of our own external borders."
"A silent war is also being fought at the moment, a frightening harbinger of an immigration invasion that no one talks about."
"We need European muscle to deal with this, too."
"(NL) Madam President, decisions were taken at the most recent European Council that were still unthinkable a year ago and I would therefore like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso."
"It is an important step, but it is also a step on a very difficult road that we have to go down in order to restore confidence in the euro and in our economy so as to get out of this crisis by promoting economic growth and jobs."
"This House - you said it - has a co-legislative role in respect of the legislative package to strengthen economic governance."
"We want to see more ambition in the package and you should enter into discussions with Parliament in the forthcoming period in that regard."
"We believe that we need stronger and more ambitious financial support that builds on the Commission's proposals."
"You have already heard various Members say that we want to see a more robust Stability and Growth Pact with a reverse voting mechanism."
"Secondly, much stronger socio-economic coordination is needed."
"That involves more than the 'commitments' of the Euro Plus Pact, as the principles of our social market economy are anchored in the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"It involves a greater commitment to elaborating on those principles in order to promote growth and jobs for our citizens."
"We want to anchor these objectives in the national reform programmes - and I have heard Mr Barroso talk about this - and we should bring forward proposals to that effect."
"You have said this, and indeed emphasised it, with a view to having these points already concluded on obtaining an agreement in June."
"As far as we are concerned you can already get to work on getting the Council moving, at least in relation to these points, which would then make an agreement in June possible."
"Madam President, I have to ask some frank questions of the European Quartet - the Troika plus the Council."
"Are you serious about saving the eurozone and the European project?"
"The bank stress tests have just concluded, based on the most pessimistic scenarios in Ireland."
"The new Irish Government has drawn a line under the Irish banking debacle."
"It has, to everyone's surprise in Ireland, decided that there will be no haircuts for senior bond holders in the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland."
"But what is the European quid pro quo?"
"Why is the European Central Bank silent on essential medium-term funding for Irish banks?"
"Why are President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel insisting on the destruction of the Irish industrial base in return for a cut in the bail-out interest rate?"
"Why are some Member States blocking progress on the European financial transaction tax and the eurobonds?"
"Why is the European budget being cut?"
"The short answer is short-term electoral calculations and doctrinaire economics."
"The Irish economic crisis is an integral part of the European crisis."
"The failure of the Irish economy would not only be a failure for Europe, but would be a failure of Europe."
"Debt sustainability for Ireland is critical for Ireland and Europe and the Quartet must get real on this issue."
"What we need from the Quartet now is imagination and vision in its ongoing negotiations with Ireland."
"I want you to mark my words."
"Ireland is a democracy, just like France, just like Germany, just like Finland: we govern at the will of the people."
"Ireland's electorate has accepted severe austerity through gritted teeth and seething anger."
"They need to see fair play in Europe, otherwise quite soon the window of tolerance currently opened to the Irish Government will shut with a bang."
"(SV) Madam President, let me start with something positive."
"I could focus on the problems that those decisions you have taken in the Council will entail and they certainly will entail problems, but the positive aspect is nevertheless that you have made progress when it comes to economic governance and the macroeconomic aspect."
"My fellow Member from Ireland just mentioned how concerned people are in this country."
"Their problems are related to the fact that so far we have not had any appreciation whatsoever of the macroeconomic aspect."
"This is something that we will be able to have in future thanks to this economic governance package."
"In this regard, I think the Council has gone in the right direction."
"However, what I feel to be a little worrying is the fact that the Council seems to lack the will to change its own decision-making culture."
"It still wants the opportunity to utilise different types of political arrangements, something we could perhaps call horse trading."
"However, if you do not change your decision-making culture, I fear that in future you will not be able to take the necessary decisions when you are facing difficult considerations on the basis of the recommendations that I nevertheless believe that the Commission will be able to produce."
"This is a challenge that the Council must take seriously and get to grips with."
"This is also illustrated rather well by the tendency that we saw during the Council meeting when my own Member State, Finland, was also being rather awkward with regard to a different issue - in that case the stability mechanisms."
"As a Finn, I regret that."
"Not all Finns think like this, but it is a good illustration of the fact that the decision-making culture in the Council needs to change."
"(PL) Madam President, the new structure of public finances in the European Union was based on an attempt to strengthen healthy financial rules and public expenditure and on an entirely unhealthy desire to limit the tax sovereignty of the Member States."
"I doubt very much that the Euro Plus countries would be in a position jointly to impose strict rules on themselves in the field of public expenditure, since they could not do so individually."
"On the other hand, I am in no doubt that standardising the tax base is an effective step towards a tax union, which has only one objective - the elimination of tax competition within the European Union."
"The French politicians Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Lagarde have revealed their true intentions by insisting for weeks on raising tax rates in Ireland, under the pretext of the fight against the crisis."
"Raising tax rates in the European Union to standard levels regardless of the Member State is however a recipe for prolonging the crisis, not for mitigating it."
"Thank you very much."
"To those Members who wish to avail of the 'catch-the-eye' procedure, I would say that we already have approximately 20 speeches and that I do not believe we shall have enough time before the vote."
"However, you are still welcome to try."
"Madam President, on 19 January, in answer to Joe Higgins, Mr Barroso declared here in this Chamber that Europe is trying to support Ireland."
"With the abject capitulation of the new Fine Gael/Labour Government to the interests of the bondholders, it is clear that it is not the Council or the Commission that are doing the supporting, but it is the working class in Ireland and in Europe, which is being forced to support European banks and speculators through paying for their losses."
"The proposals for economic governance represent an attempt to entrench cutbacks and wage cuts."
"The scoreboard on austerity, and the proposals for fines of hundreds of millions of euro, are designed to ensure that, regardless of mass opposition, working people pay for the crisis."
"This European shock doctrine will be facilitated by a change to the Treaties, on which the establishment in Europe and Ireland are determined to avoid a referendum."
"The Socialist Party and the Left in Ireland will demand a referendum on this proposal for permanent austerity."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this Council meeting looked at three highly important matters: the environmental and nuclear disaster that has struck Japan, the financial crisis that is sweeping across Europe and the situation in the Maghreb."
"On the first point, despite being supportive of a population that has been so badly hit, we cannot agree to revise trade agreements to the detriment of our own businesses."
"Instead, we are in favour of humanitarian intervention, providing equipment, people and money."
"Thinking that the financial crisis is over is pure fantasy."
"It is essential to set out a package of assistance to help Member States escape the current situation, thereby ensuring stability across the whole euro area."
"We also support the reduction of regulatory and bureaucratic burdens, as well as the promotion of trade with third countries -as long as it brings mutual benefits."
"We think the European Union has given a terrible account of itself on the Maghreb issue, since each Member State acted independently and Baroness Ashton, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, did not know how to manage the crisis."
"In particular, the European Union has abandoned Italy to an uncontrolled invasion of illegal migrants."
"(DE) Madam President, the people of Europe are becoming more and more anxious."
"There are two topics that are particular cause for concern."
"The first is that we continue to take an inconsistent line in dealing with the economic crisis and the difficulties of the euro."
"It is also a fact that the Council and the Commission are lagging behind events."
"We need to be realistic: we need a debt haircut, at least in Greece and probably also in Portugal."
"There is no escaping this."
"The longer we take to address this issue, the more it will cost, not just in financial terms, but also in terms of the general credibility of the European project."
"Events in Greece will serve to arouse emotions."
"We were part of a special delegation to the country: the underlying attitude is that the EU is responsible for the problems in Greece because of a lack of clear communication and because the necessary steps, which are already obvious, are not being taken."
"The second topic is nuclear power."
"The so-called stress tests being prepared will only make sense and credibility in a cohesive Europe will only be restored if these stress tests are performed according to stringent criteria and not according to the weak criteria of the IAO, if genuinely independent experts are consulted and if the events and the entire process is presented to the public in an appropriate and understandable way."
"(IT) Madam President, President of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in my political worldview, ideals need to be reconciled with interests."
"In what is perhaps a slightly orderly and naive view of the European Institutions, I think the European Institutions represent our ideals while, for many reasons, our governments represent our interests."
"There is therefore a game to be played."
"What is striking is that it seems to me that in some situations the team representing ideals refuses to play the game."
"Some weeks ago, when Parliament proposed to recognise, or rather proposed that the Commission should recommend to the Council that it recognise the Provisional Libyan Council, Baroness Ashton said that it was not within her mandate."
"Yesterday, after a wonderful presentation, when it came down to proposing a strategy to the Council that would make the crisis related to migration flows a European issue, Mrs Malmström said that she rejected the idea because she thinks it will not win majority backing in the Council."
"How is the 'ideals team' going to win the game if our players refuse to shoot at goal because they think the goalkeeper is too good?"
"I think this is a fundamental point for an historical understanding of the task to which we are called."
"I would therefore like to make this observation: who are our attacking players?"
"They are the European Institutions: Parliament, the Commission and even you, Mr Van Rompuy, because I think that you do not represent the Council in the sense that you defend its interests but you are the man that can make the Council understand which ideals to focus on."
"I therefore simply ask: if you are our attacking players, pass the ball around, attack, score goals and - as we say about this kind of game - make us dream."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the establishment of a permanent stability mechanism is an important achievement that provides the foundations for the political commitment to defend the euro at all costs."
"Therefore, despite not inconsiderable reservations about the methods and intergovernmental nature of the fund, Parliament supported this watershed moment and has focused on ensuring a solid link between the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the EU Institutions."
"In this vein, the reference in the European Council's conclusions to a regulation establishing the procedures to define the conditional requirements is important and we now expect the Commission to come up with a suitable proposal."
"Even though this is a positive result, it is difficult to consider it adequate."
"The problem is the basic direction of European economic governance."
"We persist in treating the symptoms of the illness instead of its causes."
"Deficits are the effect and not the cause of the crisis."
"Thinking that we can cure the illness by limiting ourselves to cutting deficits with one hand and refinancing banks with the other is sheer make-believe: it risks deepening the crisis and making the very task of the permanent stability mechanism unsustainable."
"If we want to treat the illness and not merely the symptoms, then we need to tackle a number of basic problems."
"We talk about strengthening European competitiveness. Rightly so, but which model of competitiveness are we pursuing?"
"We cannot bring in a model for recovery driven solely by exports to third countries, because this will accentuate imbalances."
"In order to be more competitive in external trade, we also need to stimulate high-quality internal demand."
"We must therefore deal with the issue of the banks and the system for providing credit to the economy in order to direct European savings toward long-term investments."
"We need to equip ourselves with instruments such as Eurobonds, the tax on financial transactions and a budget worthy of the name, in order to make large-scale public investment at a European level that can provide a kick-start for private investment."
"Finally, we need to think of the European social model as a resource instead of a burden."
"Madam President, the Euro Plus Pact might be useful, but it must not be used as an excuse for weakness in the legislative package."
"A strong commitment to the single market is key to competitiveness in the EU and therefore the euro area."
"That is welcome, but single market initiatives remain in the framework of the Treaty and the 27."
"The ESM facility, I fear, lacks flexibility and is unsustainable for recovery with a two-and-a-half to three per cent risk premium."
"I understand the need for discipline and risk provision, but these rescue mechanisms are not for money-making, especially when there is self interest beyond eurozone stability, such as several Member State banks being supported by Irish taxpayers, as has been mentioned."
"We have not solved the banking crisis, nor will we by being faint-hearted."
"Germany, even, has not recapitalised its own banks nor recognised impaired assets and also relies on the indulgence of everyone else in the EU and worldwide to allow silent participations as core capital, otherwise stress tests will be failed."
"So, President of the Commission, President of the Council, let us have some vision, some humility, some honest self appraisal; the very least you can do is to treat risk premiums as collateral and give them back when the risk is gone."
"Small-mindedness will not save the euro and the markets know that."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is in fact not within the remit of the politicians to use taxpayers' money to rescue the banks or to provide states with artificial liquidity."
"The real function of politics is to establish the legal framework to ensure that such a situation never arises."
"You now need to do the wrong thing because you have failed for decades to do the right thing."
"You now intend getting to the root of the problem, which is something that we welcome."
"However, as far as can be foreseen, it would seem that you are once again working at the wrong level with the wrong resources and within the wrong framework because you are trying to deal with the issue outside of the Treaties."
"Happily we have succeeded in bringing part of the dealings within the scope of the Community method, however there is still a lack of classic top-down policy."
"In this area above all others there is a need for every policy to be democratically debated, legitimised and checked."
"You are using the wrong instruments because you are taking the money from the taxpayer to support the banks and those who speculate with the banks and other financial products. You have still failed to take adequate steps to deal with those who have been profiting from this situation for a long time."
"This means that you are continuing to foster an imbalance in European society that weakens approval for this policy, rather than strengthening it."
"You are placing a burden on the public coffers and budgets on the one hand and protecting private assets on the other."
"This does nothing to resolve the actual problems, but simply remedies some of the symptoms."
"(NL) Madam President, for years, many Member States operated a budgetary policy that seemed just too good to be true."
"Running up debts was not seen as a problem as it was felt that economic growth would melt them away like the sun melts the ice."
"Many private individuals felt the same way."
"They bought expensive houses far beyond what they could afford."
"The rising value of those properties was supposed to save them, but this house of cards collapsed."
"The debt crisis is being tackled with new debts."
"The European Central Bank has bought up billions worth of government bonds issued by Portugal, Ireland and Greece."
"The economies of these countries will now have to be under the whip and grow like crazy on a consistent basis for many years in order to pull through."
"Madam President, that will not succeed."
"These economies are shrinking alarmingly."
"This is setting a course straight for bankruptcy."
"It is therefore time for Crisis Strategy 2.0."
"We must allow the bankrupt countries to return to their former currencies in conjunction with a vigorous devaluation and a partial write-off of their debts."
"The situation could then be re-examined in a year or 10."
"(PT) Madam President, it is amazing but also revealing of the paths that this European Union is following, that the main spokespersons for the Council and the Commission have ignored the severe social crisis being experienced by a number of European Union countries, specifically in the euro area."
"Where are the answers for the nearly 100 million people in poverty in this European Union, including more than 20 million workers on low wages and with insecure jobs, which contributes to the scandalously high profits of big business and finance?"
"Where are the answers for the nearly 25 million unemployed, the majority of whom are women and young people, and to whom a dignified present and the possibility of building a future that could ensure the very development of our countries are denied?"
"Yet again, the sole concern of the Council's decisions has been the defence of the interests of big business and finance, with greater centralisation of political power in order to facilitate a greater concentration and accumulation of economic power."
"All of this in order to, in the name of the crisis, call into question social and labour rights, increase the exploitation of those who are working, and exacerbate the dependence of countries with more fragile economies, such as Portugal."
"Madam President, the Council deems centralised regulation of national budgetary agendas essential to aid economic recovery - in particular, the proposal of multiannual consolidation plans addressing deficit, revenue and expenditure targets to be reached within stipulated time-frames with associated penalties if obligations are not met."
"The UK deficit is largely structural and must be addressed internally."
"I greatly oppose any involvement from Brussels in my country's affairs, considering the mess made in Greece and Ireland, which are likely to need further bail-outs."
"Portugal would rather turn to Brazil, suggesting Lisbon's reluctance to become an economic protectorate with austerity measures that stifle growth."
"The Council states consolidation should be frontloaded in Member States with large deficits."
"What would stop migration of citizens to stronger economies in the Union under laws of the EU's own creation?"
"The Council suggests reducing the regulatory burden."
"Does this encompass legislation for which Europe has been the architect for decades, such as the Working Time Directive and extended maternity pay?"
"Decentralised and less-stifled markets are vital for economic welfare, not punitive regulatory measures."
"(DE) Madam President, as we know, three explosive issues were discussed at the meeting of the European Council in which the EU decisions were, in my view, characterised by incorrigibility and a failure to grasp reality."
"On the one hand, the EUR 700 billion rescue package will soon be exhausted and may also drag the EU's net contributors into ruin."
"Instead of admitting the failure of the stability mechanism in the interests of efficient crisis management, the EU has simply multiplied the risk for everyone."
"On the other hand, it is open to question whether an opposition formed by former Gaddafi ministers is really interested in democracy."
"I am very unnerved by the fact that the military commander of the Libyan rebels has been identified as a long-serving CIA agent."
"Finally, the nuclear power plant stress tests, which are to be carried out on a voluntary basis without consequences, are further evidence of how divorced Brussels has become from reality."
"However, the Commission really missed the boat when it reactivated a twenty-year-old regulation without adjusting the limits for radioactive foodstuffs."
"(FR) Madam President, President of the European Council, President of the Commission, on the Economic and Monetary Union the outcome of the European Council is impressive."
"Well done!"
"We must, however, understand that this will present a new and formidable problem, namely political acceptance of the decisions thus taken, on two levels."
"The first level being between the Member States themselves."
"Ever since this Euro Plus Pact process began it has been based on purely intergovernmental consensus, at the initiative of the largest Member State."
"This is fine if it is a one-off."
"However, if, over a number of consecutive years, we continue down the same political path, we run the risk of heightening national tensions."
"The German Chancellor has already been booed on the streets of Athens and Dublin."
"This intergovernmental procedure therefore needs to be transformed gradually into a genuinely European procedure, one not just for the EU, but for Europe as a whole."
"This is the thrust of the amendments adopted by Parliament, and we should thank and congratulate Mr Juncker and you, Mr Van Rompuy, for having adopted them."
"The second level is acceptance in the eyes of the public in each Member State."
"How would opposition parties in our countries feel if they were bound by policy directions about which they had never been consulted?"
"Let us look at what happened yesterday in the Irish elections."
"Let us look at the electoral debate today in Portugal."
"The only way in which these recommendations can acquire political legitimacy is to ensure that national parliaments are involved from the very outset, throughout the process of the European semester, and yet the Council conclusions only mention these parliaments in passing, in the same category as regions, social partners and NGOs."
"Infinitely much more is at stake."
"The decisions taken mean we now have to explore a new dimension of European democracy."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Madam President, the Council and Commission are quite right when they suggest that the public budgets in Europe need to be consolidated."
"However, if we look at how this works and how it will continue to work in the future, then it is evident that the wrong people are being affected."
"Schools are being closed, teachers are losing their jobs, researchers are finding themselves out on the street and public investments are being cut or left to stagnate."
"I would like to ask Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso: Is this your intention?"
"Of course you will say that this is not what you want and that other areas are to be cut back."
"My question then is: Where are the cuts to be made?"
"My key question is as follows: If you believe that the cuts should be made elsewhere, then why is it that the draft that you propose for decision making in the 'six-pack' for economic governance makes no distinction as to whether a country purchases tanks or weapons of war or invests in an ailing national economy, or whether it makes an investment in the future?"
"Or perhaps whether it invests in a modern energy supply system and in the education and training of its children?"
"Romano Prodi once famously said that these drafts are stupid."
"His words are still true because this distinction between good and bad investments cannot be made."
"Our only choice is to improve these drafts, because Europe cannot be governed sensibly if such distinctions are beyond us."
"My last question is: Where is the income to be found that will enable us to move forward out of the crisis?"
"After all, we cannot just save our way out of the problem."
"Mr Barroso, we await your proposal on the financial transaction tax in Europe, something that this House has backed with a large majority."
"Give Europe a chance and avoid wasting any more time with pious words."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, listening to you carefully one gets the impression that everything is ship-shape: the euro is secure, we have a new Stability and Growth Pact, we have an ESM and we have a Euro Plus Pact."
"I would say this quite clearly: 'While I have heard the message, I am not sure I believe it.'"
"We should not lose sight of the starting point for all these deliberations and measures, namely the run-away debt of some euro Member States, the loss of competitiveness, economic distortions and, as a consequence, an increasing current account deficit that has to be financed."
"It is already obvious that many Member States will not be able to meet the conditions of the new Stability and Growth Pact with the best will in the world."
"The ESM will not help to overcome economic distortions because no one has seriously faced up to the idea that a euro Member State could become insolvent and because the prospect of financial aid from the ESM will lead to further laxity."
"The so-called stringent regulations will prove to be relatively lightweight in practice."
"The need for unanimous resolutions is resulting in the horse-trading that was a familiar fixture in the past."
"Finally, the pact for the euro is much too non-committal to cause destitute countries to implement far-reaching real economic reforms."
"Overall, therefore, I fear that we will not succeed in eliminating the root cause of the problem."
"We shall have a permanent overdraft facility whose credit parameters will have to be increased at regular intervals."
"This will turn into a bottomless pit and the citizens in the states that will have to foot the bill will find themselves duped once again."
"Public confidence in Europe will decline even further as a result."
"(NL) Madam President, I have a personal question for Mr Van Rompuy."
"The war in Libya goes on."
"We have seen that there used to be warm relations between the Libyan leader and European leaders, who were like best mates in a playground."
"Last time, I showed everyone some photographs, including of you, Mr Van Rompuy."
"I believe you to be a man of integrity, an honest man, even in politics."
"You are consistent."
"For that reason I have foregone the photographs."
"Hundreds of people were killed in Lockerbie, many of them Europeans and then we see European leaders meeting with this murderer."
"When I saw you, therefore, I felt let down."
"Perhaps it was precisely because you are in this job, between prime ministers and presidents and other chosen individuals."
"I want to advise you, however, to keep your feet on the ground."
"Europe must stand on the side of freedom."
"The essence of this project is freedom, something that you and Mr Barroso, who was also very friendly with Mr Gaddafi, neglected and that leaves me feeling let down."
"Madam President, so far we have dealt with the crisis but now we need to deal with the fundamental problems that caused the crisis - namely the large deficits and the weak public finances."
"That is why the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is of utmost importance, not only to reach the aims and targets but also to have credibility in the economies of Europe."
"We also need to tackle the problems of the lack of competitiveness and economic growth."
"That is the main task we need to deal with in order to fight poverty and create jobs, but also to secure prosperity."
"Of course, Member States have a fundamental responsibility here to restructure budgets, giving priority to social security and investments in growth at the same time as deficits are reduced."
"They must reform markets, including labour markets and other opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"That is what Member States must do - and much more - but let us also underline what the European Union as such must do."
"We must have the same level of preparedness to restructure the budget of the European Union as we are demanding from Member States, ensuring that we give priority to growth and investment, research and science and open markets."
"We also need to ensure that we are reforming the European market."
"Seventy percent of the European economy is in the service sector, but the Services Directive is rather limited in that perspective."
"The future of the European economy lies in the service sector and the knowledge economy."
"There is strong demand for the Commission to put forward proposals making the internal market applicable to the whole knowledge economy."
"That is the key issue in making Europe the leading knowledge economy in the world."
"(FR) Madam President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, following this crisis, what is the European Union's most potent weapon where global competition is concerned?"
"You have defined it yourselves: the EU 2020 Strategy."
"Yet when I look at what you are doing in terms of economic governance, I get the impression that there is total contradiction."
"Indeed, if one looks at the stability pact and economic governance, you are shifting from a coordination strategy to a supervision strategy, resulting in a Washington consensus becoming a Brussels consensus."
"When you talk about structural reforms, you talk about wage cuts and an increase in the retirement age."
"I am going to talk to you about the real structural reforms that we need."
"We need public investment, first and foremost in education."
"Did you know that during the whole period of the Lisbon Strategy, half of the Member States reduced the budget they spent on education?"
"Did you penalise them for doing that?"
"Are you aware that the European Union will never implement this 2020 Strategy if we do not pool investments for the future, if, when you assess the public expenditure of Member States, the only expenditure that you treat differently, where you take quality into account, is when Member States introduce capital-funded pension reforms, whereas you ignore those who are inclined to make efforts with regard to education?"
"When I look at the situation in Ireland today, one thing strikes me."
"Day in day out you decide to save banks; meanwhile, the Irish are sinking."
"This is not the European Union we want."
"I would prefer us to 'save' the people of Ireland rather than their banks."
"What is more, in order to save the banks, you invented 'stress tests'."
"I am now under the impression that every time we come up against a problem, we introduce stress tests."
"These are the new talking shops."
"There is a stress test for nuclear energy, a stress test for banks; there might even be a stress test for the Commission one day."
"Perhaps we will suggest it."
"I personally, however, would prefer to see the Commission take the initiative and be where it should be."
"When I look at the opinions of the European Central Bank today, I get the feeling that it is more concerned about what is not included in its mandate, namely wage levels, than about the viability of our banking system and its effectiveness in bringing about the public investment we need."
"This Parliament has submitted proposals on the taxation of financial transactions and on Eurobonds, but you refuse to consider them."
"Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, it is time that you listened to the proposals coming from this House, to ensure that the strategy that you yourselves have adopted is a success."
"(SV) Madam President, at its recent meeting, the Council also debated the issue of the safety of nuclear power plants and European reactors."
"This is a topic that is now the subject of negotiations in Parliament."
"We will have a resolution that will be put to the vote on Thursday."
"I believe that most European citizens probably believed that stress tests had been a matter of course as part of the safety measures with regard to nuclear power for decades."
"That is not the case."
"The proposal that has been adopted by the Council in its conclusions is far too weak."
"We need to test not only the technology and the geography but also the safety culture and multiple risks."
"We must ensure that there is openness and transparency."
"It is totally unacceptable for governments and national authorities to audit themselves in this area."
"There clearly needs to be independent checks, facts must be made public and full transparency must prevail under the scrutiny of the Commission."
"That is the only way we can make this technology credible for the future."
"We also need to renegotiate the institutional structure, which is as old as the European Union."
"It must be updated."
"We must have European safety standards within the system and, finally, we must ensure that the Council, too, puts forward proposals when it comes to energy efficiency, alternative energy sources and a timetable for these."
"Madam President, the most important conclusion from the Council meeting was not headline-sexy."
"It said that the single market has a key role to play to deliver growth."
"But is this all talk?"
"On economic governance, I already see colleagues wanting to water down the Stability Pact, and when it comes to supporting businesses, we are not much better."
"MEPs flock to sign up to campaigns for cyclists and horse welfare, but when it came to campaigning to cut red tape for small businesses, only a third of us joined in and there was only one UK Labour signature."
"The Commission promises to unlock venture capital, which is laudable, but almost laughable given that it spent all of last year trying to legislate it out of the market altogether."
"It is time to walk the walk."
"Nine heads of state have signed a letter on specific actions for business, trade, innovation and investment."
"They call on us to choose growth."
"I certainly do."
"(ES) Madam President, the European Council has adopted a series of measures covering governance, budgetary rationalisation, competitiveness and so on and I must say that they are all along the right lines."
"The European Council's 16 points are largely due to the work of President Van Rompuy and President Barroso, to whom I first of all offer my congratulations, because I do value - some of us do value - what you have done as leaders of the institutions."
"However, the problem is that not only are we going through a financial crisis, we are also experiencing a crisis of confidence and a political crisis in Europe and in the European nations."
"The problem is not simply one of assessing the actual economic and technical contents of the European Council."
"At the same time as there are meetings of the European Council, European, national and regional elections are being held and all of these confirm our apprehensions."
"Extreme positions are being adopted."
"Some of these positions are currently taking refuge in forms of nationalism."
"Therefore, you must be very well aware that our problem is not simply to face up to the crisis, but to face up to the political and social consequences of that crisis."
"It is not simply a time when there is, as a fellow Member quite rightly said, a north-south crisis in the European Union."
"These are new times and a particular feature of new times is that crises mount up and proliferate and are not resolved."
"They turn up unexpectedly, both inside and outside the EU."
"Moreover, these new times basically demand new ways of thinking at both individual and institutional levels, and that is the major political challenge that faces us."
"Any change in one's personal way of thinking starts with that person him or herself."
"First of all, if that person is a Member of this House, he or she must say in what ways Parliament must change if it is to deal with new times."
"The same goes for members of the Commission and the Council; each and every one of us must be able to face up to this issue."
"However, in any case, the main thing is not to go off course, because you are heading in the right direction."
"(ES) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the first crisis to affect the euro area, and when the crisis occurred it became clear to us that the European Union was not equipped to deal with it."
"There were design faults, such as the lack of planning regarding financial assistance to countries within the euro area, inefficiency in fulfilling commitments in the areas of public finance and competitiveness and increased macroeconomic imbalances and divergence within the euro area."
"We saw how steps that had been taken so as to have a European voice in the areas of foreign policy and security, were not supported in the area of the economy, despite the imperatives of globalisation."
"Our economic potential could not be turned into economic leadership at world level and the imbalance between the single currency pillar and the intergovernmental economic pillars became all the more evident."
"If we are to provide an adequate response, we must make progress on integration."
"There is no national way out of the crisis, unless some people have got the wrong century."
"That is why, on 24 and 25 March, the European Council took important, even spectacular, steps in the right direction."
"The implementation of the European semester, the adoption of the permanent stability mechanism, along with the commitments made before Parliament, including the legislative package, which will have to be balanced by Parliament, are all steps in the right direction."
"The Euro Plus Pact does, without a doubt, represent a step forward but much remains to be done."
"The crisis is still there, there are 23 million unemployed and there are still important clouds on our horizon and major challenges to face."
"That is why we need a three-dimensional pact with the citizens of Europe because there are limits to austerity policies and we need to promote a policy of growth and employment through investment in order to redefine our economic model and fulfil the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"A policy of fiscal and financial sustainability requires a European framework as much in the area of sovereign debt as in the recapitalisation of financial bodies and we need a genuine European social pact to introduce improved productivity, with social standards, progress in taxation and the bringing of the welfare state up to date."
"- (CS) Madam President, what happened at the European Council meeting on 24 and 25 March 2011, and the contents of the text that was adopted, amounts to a narrative on the promotion of fiscal unity by the back door."
"The creation of the single currency of the euro and the period of existence of this currency comprise a history of ignorance of economic laws, broken rules, lies about the size of public finance deficits and deception in national statistics."
"The Stability and Growth Pact was adopted as the last chance to deal with the notorious rule-breakers, and it has been violated by everyone for years."
"How could it be otherwise in the Euro Plus Pact, I wonder, given the different nature of the national economies, the different inflation levels and the different levels of unemployment?"
"I consider the proposed harmonisation of the underpinnings of corporation tax to be particularly inappropriate."
"(PT) Madam President, President of the Council, President of the Commission, firstly, I would naturally like to congratulate you on the results of the Council meeting of 24 and 25 March, particularly on the consolidation of the European semester, but much more than this, on the institutionalisation of the European Stability Mechanism and on the Euro Plus Pact that came out of the euro area summit of 11 March."
"I believe that these are very positive results for Europe, and it is just a shame that this process was not fully concluded on 24 and 25 March."
"I believe that, if we had given this signal, if the Member States had given this signal in the Council, completing this fund reform package in full, we would be in a stronger position today for facing the next 3-4 months, and we would have partly alleviated the effects of the crisis currently being experienced in my country, Portugal, about which I also need to say something."
"This is that the Portuguese Social Democratic Party (PSD), which is fully integrated into the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), is absolutely and completely willing to fulfil all requirements and obligations for being part of Europe."
"That is what we have been doing, even at this time, when there are difficulties with regard to short-term financing."
"In contrast to what the government of the Portuguese Socialist Party (PS) has done, the PSD has been demonstrating its total willingness to provide Europe with the guarantees necessary in the context of this crisis."
"Therefore, without bringing domestic politics into the European Parliament, I would like to signal the PSD's commitment to and complete guarantee of the strict timetable that the country will need to adhere to following its elections on 5 June."
"(HU) Madam President, President of the Commission, President of the European Council, the agreement reached at the European Summit was the first major political success of the current Hungarian Presidency."
"It is primarily a conservative success."
"Its implementation depends on unity."
"For this reason it is regrettable and requires explanation that four countries with conservative governments did not accept the Euro Plus Pact."
"It is regrettable and turncoat behaviour to recommend something to others that we, as the Presidency, do not consider acceptable for ourselves."
"Whoever stays out misses out."
"A country which does not aim for a breakthrough based on knowledge and competitiveness but for cheap wages and winning the tax competition will be the poorhouse of the European Union even in the medium term."
"As I have mentioned tax competition, Commission President, President of the Council, how do you explain that the Council did not discuss the issue of tax havens?"
"Do you think that this is not a problem for European citizens?"
"You are mistaken!"
"We expect much more progress from the Council and the Commission."
"Permit me to also address the Japanese natural disaster and the consequent industrial disaster."
"There are 12 000 dead, 17 000 missing, hundreds of thousands are homeless and millions are without work."
"The European Union, which considers solidarity an asset, must help."
"The disaster shook the world's energy and raw materials markets."
"It will determine the political and economic environment for a long time."
"It is imperative that we improve the world's nuclear safety."
"It is imperative that we devise rules that make this possible."
"It is imperative that we boost research and development investments and strengthen diversification in European energy policy."
"These objectives, Commission President and President of the Council, have already been formulated in the 2020 objectives."
"It is the Council's and the Commission's job to build the road leading here and generate the resources for this."
"We wish you every success in this."
"(EL) Madam President, without wishing to underestimate the importance of recent decisions passed by the European Council, the defining quality of European decisions over the last year has been too little too late."
"This is not because important steps forward have not been taken; it is because we cannot use the past and what we did in previous times to stabilise and strengthen the euro area as our benchmark today; our benchmark must be how efficient we are in dealing with the crisis."
"Unfortunately, however, we are not efficient when it comes to the markets - just look at how the cost of borrowing has risen over the past few days for countries in the region, especially Portugal - and we are not efficient or persuasive, unfortunately, when it comes to the European public, who increasingly feels that Europe is part of the problem, not part of the solution."
"The European Parliament, in two recent resolutions, and prominent figures across the entire political spectrum have pointed out that, if we want an effective and global response to the debt crisis, we need to seriously consider the possibility of a system for issuing Eurobonds."
"At the same time, the majority in the European Council tells us that this cannot happen, because it would create a moral hazard for fiscally healthy countries in times of crisis."
"While they cite the moral hazard in order to campaign against Eurobonds, they are creating a moral hazard at the expense of the countries with financial difficulties, by officially and unhesitatingly tabling the prospect of controlled bankruptcy and the involvement of private individuals in cost-sharing, thereby perpetuating the crisis by keeping the cost of borrowing unnecessarily high."
"If we truly want private individuals to be involved and fairer cost-sharing, then we should seriously examine the question of a financial transaction tax as a matter of priority, so that some of the revenue can be used to finance the permanent mechanism."
"(BG) Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, the crisis which we are going through at the moment confirms the need for visionaries in Europe, not only among decision makers but among ordinary citizens too."
"It is sad, but true."
"We wasted a lot of time and missed out on numerous opportunities during the years of growth."
"Creating the single currency has undoubtedly been a success."
"However, it looks like a beautiful house with a damaged roof."
"We moved in when it was dry, but now the rain has come and is falling on the euro area in the form of a high deficit and debt level, with low creditworthiness."
"The Euro Plus Pact and the decisions made by the Council mark a step in the right direction."
"The economic semester is a measure which will provide our economies and budgets with greater coordination and resilience in financial crises."
"I am pleased about and it is the right decision for 60 countries outside the euro area, including my country, Bulgaria, to join the Pact so that they can actively participate in the decision-making process on economic policies, enabling Europe to move away from different standards and principles."
"I am sure that European economic policies will have to be based, sooner or later, on a Community rather than an intergovernmental method, as is the case now."
"Indeed, the day is perhaps not far off when there will be a new intergovernmental conference or even a convention on economic and political governance issues in Europe."
"I welcome the Council's conclusion on the matters relating to Libya."
"The European Union must be actively committed when it comes to establishing democracy after the end of the conflict and help the Libyan people create a constitutional state and civil society."
"This will obviously send out a signal as well to the other countries in the region that Europe supports the legitimate demands of citizens."
"Europe must also learn the lessons from the crisis in Libya and the whole Arab world."
"What else can we do for our close southern neighbours?"
"Can we use our experience from the Eastern Partnership in the Mediterranean region?"
"Finally, Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso, Europe needs operational rapid-reaction forces which can carry out missions under the European Union flag."
"Increased capabilities and integration in terms of security and defence are required to achieve this objective, without, of course, duplicating or replacing NATO."
"(FR) Madam President, Mr Van Rompuy, there is one thing in your conclusions that we all clearly agree on: rigorous governance."
"No one can be against that."
"However, rigour should not mean zero deficit or austerity, but rather intelligent spending."
"The Union's necessary competitiveness should be improved, that goes without saying, but wage cuts and social expenditure cuts should not be the only adjustable variable."
"Competitiveness is gained by investing in qualifications, research, excellence and major infrastructure."
"Everyone here agrees on the fact that the Union and the euro are at a turning point."
"We are faced with having to choose between, on the one hand, a model of turning in on ourselves, where each country compares its competitiveness with the neighbouring Member State, where it looks at its rating on the financial markets and at the lowest possible contribution it can make to the European budget, and, on the other hand, a model based on solidarity - the only acceptable model - in which social standards are raised, in particular by upholding the position of social dialogue and of unions, with minimum social requirements across Europe and wage-indexing mechanisms that are protected, and in which solidarity between generations is guaranteed by a pension system which provides enough to live in dignity, as Parliament has recently stated."
"Member States should be free from the pressures of financial markets thanks to a European Central Bank with a strengthened role, and we should have better regulated rating agencies, a solidarity-based model which guarantees genuine social and territorial cohesion in Europe, notably through an increased European budget, with a fundamental reform of its own resources and with the introduction, at last, of the tax on financial transactions."
"Your conclusions are based on a distinct ideology that says that debt and deficit are responsible for the recession, when the real cause is the irresponsibility of financial players."
"Without a change in the ideological prism within the Council, we will not come out of the recession, and nor will we restore citizens' trust."
"There is a clear democratic deficit today, and if the Council and the Commission continue to make proposals that fail to take Parliament's opinion into account, our fellow citizens will reject our project even more."
"(NL) Madam President, the last year has seen a great deal of very hard work and a number of reforms have been set in train in order to ensure that, in future, too, the European Union can remain a society in which living and working is good and just."
"I am therefore happy to endorse what my fellow Members have said in praising the Presidency of the European Council."
"Following on from everything that other Members have already said, there are three points that I want to bring up."
"The first of these relates to labour costs as one of the factors involved in competition policy."
"During the financial crisis I often heard both the Commission President and the President of the European Council talk in praising terms of automatic stabilisers."
"Instead of sharp peaks and troughs these would ensure that we have a more stable economy with fewer job losses, which fits in perfectly with the social market economy that we want to be."
"However, some people now fear that an all-too-heavy focus on the labour costs factor in the Euro Plus Pact could too greatly limit the leeway for these automatic stabilisers to operate."
"My question, Mr Van Rompuy, is what is your view on this?"
"I have a second reservation to raise in relation to the factor of labour costs."
"I hear again and again from the trade unions that, in the area of wage settlement, the autonomy of the Member States and their social partners is being harmed and that we are possibly heading for a flagrant violation of the regulation of competencies under the Treaty."
"My question about this is, are we really treading risky ground here, or is this fear unfounded?"
"I would also like to hear your analysis, Mr Van Rompuy, as, if this double fear is unfounded, we really must banish it."
"Finally, I have a question about the common framework for calculating company tax base."
"In the conclusions of the spring summit, I read just one sentence - just the one - on this, and even that was without any commitment at all from the European Council in this connection."
"Is the conclusion that I am to draw from this that there is still no prospect of consensus for the introduction of this common framework for calculating company tax base and that, when it comes to increased cooperation in this regard, the best we have is dreams? Thank you in advance for your answers."
"(EL) Madam President, Mrs Podimata has covered the financial issue for me."
"I shall comment on another very important issue: the issue of nuclear energy."
"What has Japan taught us?"
"Two things: firstly, that no one can be ever be sufficiently well-prepared for natural disasters or combinations of natural disasters and, secondly, that nuclear energy is never completely safe."
"What are we doing?"
"We are accusing Japan of negligence."
"We are saying that it was not nuclear energy, it was Japan that was not safe."
"We are saying that we shall carry out our own inspections of nuclear power plants, so that we can see which are not safe and which are and then we will develop them."
"This means that we did not learn our lessons from Japan."
"We are not as prepared as Japan for disasters; we hardly even have a civil protection policy for cross-border problems, such as a nuclear accident."
"We must stop calling today for new nuclear power plants to be built."
"We must invest not in the development of nuclear energy, but in developing the efficiency of photovoltaic and other renewable energy sources."
"The impact of nuclear energy is cross-border and the European Union is responsible for it, which is why, Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy, it will be your very serious responsibility if we fail to take the necessary precautions against another accident."
"Madam President, I would like to touch upon three issues."
"First, I think that the Council summit meeting brought very important and positive results, given the difficulty of the situation and the context."
"I welcome the formula of having an inclusive Euro Plus Pact open to those who are not yet eurozone members, as President Van Rompuy said."
"At the same time, we are creating a European stability mechanism safety net."
"Could we not consider that in both mechanisms in Euro Plus, which is an obligational commitment to observe certain rules of behaviour in macroeconomic and macro-financial policy, and also in ESM."
"The safety net should be open so that both convergence and solidarity, which is ESM, may be inclusive and not exclusive."
"My second remark concerns neighbourhood policy."
"We seem to be redesigning our neighbourhood policy."
"The stimulus is coming from the South, but it is important for our overall neighbourhood policy."
"I hope that it will be - if we read the documents by Baroness Ashton and Mr Füle - far more society-oriented, more generous towards those societies and demanding of authorities and governments."
"We should move away from short-sighted economic interests and base this policy on a human rights and democracy approach, moving from status quo policy to transition policy."
"But when we create this new paradigm it should also be applicable to the East."
"We should be more human rights and democracy-based and more society-oriented and less authority-oriented than we are now."
"My third point concerns EU-NATO."
"In Libya we have a new experience of EU and NATO cooperation, which is a relationship which we do not yet fully understand."
"We also have an old experience in Afghanistan, which is not always good."
"At the same time, this relationship is important."
"Let us aim to be successful this time."
"(LV) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must draw a clear dividing line between the past and the future."
"As far as the past is concerned, I should say that a separate solution must be found for the particular cases of Greece and Ireland."
"I believe that we must allow those losses to be written off by means of a structured plan, so that these societies may get back onto their feet."
"It is not correct to continue punishing the taxpayers in these countries for mistakes in fact made by the private sector, specifically by the banks."
"As far as the future is concerned, we must look to what after all is our goal for Europe."
"That goal is to secure stable growth."
"However, in order to secure stable growth, the necessary means, and this is also what is being discussed at the Council, is to secure low levels of government debt."
"What will low or little government debt ensure?"
"It will ensure the confidence of the financial markets in these countries, which will in turn ensure low interest rates, so that businesses in those countries may again recover and develop."
"When businesses develop, investment will follow."
"With investment will come jobs, which are essential for us in Europe."
"This process, namely reducing government expenditure, so that the level of debt is low, does not, moreover, exclude investment."
"Several members have mentioned that investment is essential, that we cannot, as they say, 'save ourselves out' of this crisis, that we must invest."
"I can specifically cite the example of my country, Latvia, which has not only taken significant savings measures in the last two years, but this year, in 2011, has allocated one third of the national budget to public-sector investment."
"It is therefore possible."
"We have to go down this road in the future, to avoid arriving where we have arrived today. Thank you for your attention."
"(RO) Madam President, the European Council took a significant step towards creating the European Stability Mechanism by adopting the decision to modify the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union."
"The future mechanism will ensure a stable, consistent response to any situations where the euro area is destabilised."
"It is excellent having such a mechanism."
"However, it is preferable not to end up in such situations, which means that the disciplinary measures set out by the economic governance provisions should also be applied consistently."
"All Member States must help maintain stability, whether they are part of the euro area or not."
"This is why the creation of the Euro Plus Pact, which has also been joined by countries outside the euro area, including Romania, is an extremely positive development."
"Implementing the European Semester will help coordinate European economic policy by improving competitiveness, cutting red tape, promoting education and boosting the labour force."
"However, these priorities must be very quickly converted into specific domestic measures."
"The success of the new European structural reforms is closely linked to strengthening the single market."
"The Union needs a strategy which will help create jobs and relieve the shortages in the EU's labour market."
"I welcome the Commission's intention to present the Single Market Act, which should be adopted by the end of 2012."
"However, I regret to say that the priority measures which will give new impetus to the single market and competitiveness do not include any mention of the need to ensure the free movement of all European workers, focusing only on the free movement of services."
"(MT) Madam President, the people fleeing the war in Libya are now coming to Europe, especially to Lampedusa and Malta."
"In my country, people have two concerns."
"Firstly, they do not know how many people will come."
"This is a fear which cannot be countered because we do not know how many people will cross over."
"Secondly, people are very concerned because of the uncertainty about Europe's willingness to help this time round."
"This is a fear we can and should address because a solidarity mechanism already exists in our legislation, in Directive No 55 of 2001."
"What we should do is use it."
"The Commission appears to be giving two reasons for not having made use of it."
"Firstly, that there is no majority in the Council of Ministers."
"I appeal to President Barroso not to cite this as reason."
"The Commission should show political leadership and take the political initiative to table a proposal for this mechanism to be activated."
"The Commission is also stating that the numbers are not yet large enough."
"However, we should be careful."
"The number could be small in relation to Europe as a whole but very large for a single country expected to host them all on its own."
"I therefore appeal directly to President Barroso to activate the solidarity mechanism and to President Van Rompuy to tell the Council of Ministers to show concrete solidarity."
"Madam President, the results of the European Council could be seen as politically and institutionally satisfactory, but the message from today's debate is that the crisis is not over."
"President Barroso has said that the economic situation remains difficult and uncertain, Mr Verhofstadt has confirmed that we are filling in the holes, but that the crisis has not been solved, and President Van Rompuy has said that the problems remain."
"This is the result of past mistakes and the lack of appropriate instruments."
"We need to draw conclusions about how these past mistakes happened and how the staggering debt burden and deficits were created."
"What was wrong with the policies of Member States and the EU institutions?"
"Without thorough analysis and conclusions, that should become a commitment for all involved, we cannot avoid repeating the same mistakes."
"The central issue remains enhancing competitiveness."
"I hope that the Commission's new Single Market Act will be truly ambitious."
"At least the digital single market topic has made a breakthrough into EU priorities."
"Last but not least, this week the new Estonian Government will be confirmed."
"At the recent elections, Estonian voters demonstrated anti-European tendencies, returning the existing Government with an increased majority despite heavy cuts in the budget ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, there is much to commend the Council conclusions as we look to the future - perhaps less so when we deal with the present and the past."
"I was interested in the comments made by Catherine Day, a senior Commission official, in Ireland last week when she said that the shine had gone off Ireland."
"I hope that does not mean each of us individually, and I hope that, given the results of the stress tests and the very strong action of the new government, the shine will come back to Ireland."
"I hope, too, that it comes back to our people, who are very depressed and disillusioned by a feeling that they carry a very heavy burden for the rest of the European Union."
"I would ask those who wag their fingers in anger about incorrect behaviour by individual countries and citizens to please remember that there were others who also joined in at the party - I speak of European banks, who tried to profit from the boom that existed not just in Ireland, but elsewhere."
"However, there is a ray of hope in the Irish media this morning."
"I see that global finance giants are backing our economy in the wake of the stress tests, and I hope that they realise that the Irish have fixed a problem for the rest of Europe, and will show us much-needed solidarity on interest rates."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, I would like to ask you a few questions."
"It is good that an agreement has been reached."
"It is good that the European economy and European currency will now be better protected."
"But is protection enough on its own?"
"Is it not necessary to go further?"
"Is it not necessary to stimulate an upturn, so that we can preserve what we are protecting?"
"I believe that too little is being done and that the wrong strategy is being followed."
"Why is the European Union investing in the export of cucumbers, bananas and live cattle rather than in universities, places of learning and schools?"
"This is something which we need to consider."
"When you say that we have no money for this, then perhaps what is needed is some reorganisation."
"We should consider whether we need new sources of income, in which case we need look no further than those who have always profited from this unspeakable situation."
"Mr Barroso, what is the real reason for your Commission's opposition to a financial transaction tax?"
"Please answer this question for me."
"You need to decide once and for all whether you are on the side of the financial industry or of our citizens."
"(FR) Madam President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, I would like to thank the chairs of the political groups for cancelling their meeting of the Conference of Presidents so that this debate could be held in plenary pursuant to Article 15."
"Concerning the stability mechanism, I would like to follow on from what Mr Lamassoure said by raising the issue of political control and specifically the issue of regulating this mechanism, and to find out who is going to grant budgetary discharge for this financial instrument."
"I will conclude my speech by asking whether the moment has not come for the Commission to provide us with a comprehensive report on public support to credit institutions, and in particular on all financial flows and on sovereign debt."
"Finally, I suggest that we consider the possibility of creating a European public rating agency to address the major problems we are having with private agencies, because rating a country is very different from rating a private company."
"(ES) Madam President, at the beginning of his speech, Mr Van Rompuy pointed out that within the space of 49 days there have been three decision-making European Council meetings and a summit."
"In other words, what had previously been a three- or six-monthly event is now the habitual manner of governing the Union in order to provide an immediate response to immediate challenges."
"However, beyond these immediate challenges lie the future horizons of the Union, and the horizons of the Union depend on our ability to compete."
"What resources do we have, at the present time, to generate knowledge?"
"We have few world-beating universities, we devote a smaller percentage of income to research and development than do the emerging and the developed countries and, at the same time, our businesses play a very minor role in research."
"We must acquire a European dimension with coordination between European universities and with curricula which generate excellence and cooperation."
"Madam President, the Presidents of the Council and the Commission spoke of the Euro Plus Pact and of the single market."
"I have a question about each."
"Do they agree with the President of the European Central Bank that a far larger European stability mechanism will be needed?"
"If they do not agree, is it simply because true professionals can rarely admit in public what they know to be true in private?"
"The only participant in the single market which implements the rules 100% is Norway."
"Since the real stress test in the crisis we face will not be of any bank or any nuclear installation, but of the solidarity of European Union Member States, do the Presidents of the Commission and Council believe that there are good chances of greater solidarity than we have seen in the past?"
"- (SK) Madam President, one of the topics of negotiation at the Council of the European Union was the definition of the new eurozone crisis mechanism."
"Even though the leaders of the governments present reached agreement on the creation of a fixed eurobond, it seems they will need to have further discussions with experts in their own countries as to its final form."
"When the Slovak prime minister, Mrs Radičová, returned home from Brussels, she found that she lacked sufficient support in the national parliament for the position she had taken in the Council negotiations."
"Without a proper and precise finalisation of the mechanism to regulate the bankruptcy of insolvent countries, activated within the framework of the eurozone, the proposed permanent mechanism will instead become a permanent instrument for European indebtedness."
"That is why no responsible national parliament can accept it in such a form."
"I would therefore like to ask you, Mr President of the Council of the European Union, to take greater account of qualified expert opinions in political proposals."
"Madam President, paragraph 5 of the report from the meeting says that policy measures will be presented to correct harmful and persistent macroeconomic imbalances and improve competitiveness, but in the introduction the talk is of promoting trade with third countries."
"Imports from third countries, particularly the so-called emergent economies, are the greatest single cause of trade imbalances and the inability to compete."
"It would be impossible for developed economies to compete with manufactured imports from these countries without driving our wages down to their levels."
"Indeed, this is hinted at in the section on page 16, on fostering competitiveness."
"It says 'there will be assessments of wage and productivity developments and competitive adjustment needs'."
"Whatever does this mean?"
"It could only mean one thing."
"Wages must be adjusted downwards to make goods competitive with those of the emergent economies."
"While principles such as free trade are sacrosanct, the economic interests of European workers, it seems, are dispensable."
"Madam President, I do not like to be in tow or obligated to anybody and neither do the Irish people - an independent race."
"For that reason the recent EU-IMF bail-out hurt the Irish people badly."
"However, I do not share the opinion that Europe is to blame for it."
"It was largely due to Ireland's incorporated banks, regulator and government, not the Irish people - but the Irish people are now being forced to pay the price and the burden is too large."
"For that reason I would ask two things: one, the interest rate should be reduced, and I would like to thank Commissioner Rehn and President Barroso for their vibes in that regard."
"Secondly, I think bondholders will have to pay a price - if not a haircut then, at the very least, they deserve a bit of a shave."
"Individuals do not get a guaranteed interest-free investment and neither should bondholders."
"If those two things were done then we might be able to make progress."
"(FR) Madam President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the Council's conclusions on economic policy and the Euro Plus Pact open up a real European Pandora's box, out of which only problems will arise, and European citizens will have to face those problems."
"The calling into question of social welfare and wage-indexing, the linking of productivity and wages, reduced purchasing power and an increase in the retirement age are just a few examples of the austerity crisis that awaits us."
"I am appalled to see that the Council has clearly not learnt any lessons from the crisis."
"Of course, we need a policy based on budgetary responsibility and rigour, no one is disputing that, but we should not insist that the citizens make all of the effort, since they are our only chance of coming out of this crisis on top."
"You forget all too quickly the financial and banking sector, which should also contribute to these crucial efforts and should above all act more responsibly."
"When will we finally see a tax on financial transactions?"
"At a time when 16 million Europeans are out of work, prices are soaring and speculative shocks are shaking the continent, the Council is placing the burden of sacrifice on labour and workers instead of on capital, and that is unacceptable."
"(HU) Madam President, President Van Rompuy assessed the Euro Plus Pact as a new stage of future economic coordination, and this is indeed an entirely new period in the field of macroeconomic coordination."
"Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, the President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, viewed it similarly, describing it as a pillar of the future European economic system."
"At the same time, it is unfortunate that Hungary's name was not among those listed by President Van Rompuy, because regrettably Hungary is not taking part in the Euro Plus Pact."
"Very many Hungarian citizens and economists do not understand either why the Hungarian Government decided in this way, because Hungary is a small country with an open economy, and the argument that this would have obstructed tax competition is unsound since it is only about the harmonisation of the corporate tax base."
"It is a shame that Hungary has missed out on this."
"(DE) Madam President, the EU is a master of procrastination."
"For decades, Gaddafi was treated as a serious partner, for decades the dangers of nuclear power were swept under the carpet and now we are pumping money into a safety net that is obviously not working."
"Why can people not see that the euro crisis cannot be resolved with the safety net?"
"First Greece and now Portugal has been downgraded by US rating agencies and the rescue package now only benefits banks and speculators who are gambling on bankrupt euro Member States."
"That is why I say it is time to end the safety net and to draw a line under the plans for Eurobonds."
"If the bankrupt states remain in the euro area, this will mark the beginning of the end for the euro."
"For this reason we would be better advised to use the billions earmarked for the rescue packages to stem the stream of refugees from North Africa with sustainable local projects or to secure genuine independence from nuclear energy."
"This would certainly represent a better investment than simply squandering the money in the casinos of the international rating agencies."
"(PT) Madam President, those who are pushing Portugal into this supposed aid do not really want to help, rather they want to make money by sinking us and sinking the euro."
"That is because in this Europe, where solidarity, cohesion and Community method have become empty words, this supposed aid is only to pay the banks that pushed us into the vortex of debt currently sucking us under, all at public expense, with the neoliberal measures of the Euro Plus Pact, with no investment to relaunch growth and employment, no Eurobonds, no financial transactions tax and no measures for dealing with the macro-economic imbalances that are destroying the euro."
"In this Europe, where there are banks that are too big to fail, but states and peoples are allowed to go under, either blindness or vested interest explains the fact that the Commission and Council have given up taking action against tax havens."
"Will it be possible to clean up, regulate and supervise the financial system, while allowing the black holes that are instrumental in corruption, tax fraud and evasion, and organised criminality to remain untouchable?"
"- (SK) Madam President, I would first like to draw attention to the incorrect theme of the conclusions from the Council meeting, which is that we have economic growth and at the same we must make savings."
"The obsession with fiscal consolidation in a period of crisis may prove fatal for us."
"Our unequivocal priority should be to restore employment and sustainable economic growth."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is the citizens who are bearing the main brunt of the crisis."
"On the one hand, they are losing jobs and are hard hit by government cost-cutting, and on top of this is the threat that the money needed for reinforcing the eurobond will come exclusively from their taxes."
"It should be the players from the financial sector that take the main role in reinforcing the eurobond."
"Madam President, President of the Commission, what the Union needs now is coordination of economic and social policies with the aim of stimulating employment and getting out of the crisis."
"We also need a clear consensus on protecting the euro, with the private finance sector playing a part."
"(DE) Madam President, the revision of the Treaty led to the inception of the ESM."
"I again appeal to everyone to observe the relevant criteria."
"After all, placing another Member State and its citizens in the firing line is irresponsible in the context of the prevailing, continuing structural crisis."
"The ESM can only have its justification if all states meet with their budgetary obligations and agree to implement cost-efficiencies."
"The crisis in Japan has shown us just how 'safe' nuclear power can be."
"Nature is a stronger force than man can harness."
"In view of the history of Chernobyl, we can only hope that the stress tests will be approached with greater caution than the limits imposed last week."
"It is time to put an end to nuclear power."
"So, let us finally concentrate on the renewable energies."
"For example, the NorGer undersea electricity cable project could replace 60 nuclear power plants."
"(LT) Madam President, I welcome the fact that the European Council managed to reach an agreement on certain issues that are particularly important for Europe."
"I would like to single out the issue of the European Semester and its importance as one of the priorities."
"I believe that priority should be given to the restoration of credible Member State budgets and social justice and to fiscal sustainability, and this would create the conditions for stability and for Member State economies to recover more speedily."
"It is very important for consolidation efforts to supplement structural reforms, particularly in implementing priorities in the European Union set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"A particularly important role should also be played by the Commission, which should monitor Member States' actions very responsibly and follow the implementation of specific measures in accordance with national stability and convergence programmes."
"Furthermore, significant concern remains as regards the attitude of the European Central Bank, the Council and the European Commission to the situation faced by commercial banks, as well as the actions of foreign rating agencies."
"Madam President, honourable Members, regarding the assessment of the last European Council, I believe that the analysis I presented was fairly well balanced and fairly reasonable."
"I think it is right to recognise that we have made important progress on the structure."
"If we compare what we have now with what we did not have beforehand, it is undoubtedly an important step forward."
"There has been, for instance, the creation of a permanent stability mechanism, which was not even provided for by the Treaty."
"Furthermore, this Parliament, by an overwhelming majority, supported a limited reform of the Treaty in order to create a new instrument, an instrument which did not even exist before."
"Therefore, let us be intellectually honest in our assessment."
"I believe there has been substantial progress in terms of the reaction to the crisis, in terms of lessons learnt with regard to the shortcomings we have seen in the past, whether at instrument level or policy level."
"However at the same time, I said, very clearly in fact, that this might not be enough."
"It is one thing to have the structure, the architecture, but it is another to have the policies to be applied."
"Indeed, the real test will be to see, after this, what governments, and also our institutions, will be able to deliver in terms of substance."
"Substance is more important than instruments."
"At the same time however, I have told you, with great transparency I think, that when we talk about ambition, the Commission would have preferred to have gone further in some areas."
"We highlighted for instance the fact that for the permanent stability mechanism, we were in favour of more flexibility."
"Unfortunately it was not possible to reach a consensus for this higher level of ambition."
"Having said that, I think it would be a mistake to reject the gains we have achieved."
"Staying on the subject of ambition, I would like to emphasise this important aspect, because some have suggested that the Commission should submit other proposals."
"Practically everything you have said, the Commission has already proposed."
"On 9 May 2010, the Commission - myself and Commissionner Rehn - tabled a legislative proposal relating to a wholly Community-based approach to the stability mechanism."
"We proposed the pooling, for instance, of debt management, what are referred to as joint and several guarantees."
"This was rejected by our Member States."
"Not by you, but obtaining the Member States' approval is essential, Mr Verhofstadt."
"We presented the text at the euro area summit."
"It was rejected by a large majority of Member States."
"That is the reality."
"On the specific matter of unanimity or majority rule for the permanent stability mechanism, I myself suggested the latter;"
"I insisted, in the presence of the President of the European Council and certain Heads of State or Government, that they should accept a qualified majority rule."
"However, it was rejected."
"Consequently, one can always insist, but the clauses need to be clear and you need to know exactly who to address your requests to."
"The Commission has made ambitious proposals, for instance in relation to stress tests; it is the European Commission and the European Central Bank who have proposed credible and transparent tests for the European Bank."
"Concerning Eurobonds, the Commission has been talking about Eurobonds for at least 30 years I think."
"This was rejected by some of our Member States."
"I myself suggested here - and I can tell you that I will do the same for the financial perspective - that we could now at least have project bonds for financing investments at draft European budget level."
"We will see at that point who will be there to support this approach in favour of European investment."
"And maybe then, some of you could convince us with your own European parties to support this more ambitious approach to the financial perspective."
"This may be an opportunity for us to work even more closely."
"That is all on the issue of ambition at European level."
"(Applause)"
"Even regarding the social issue, which I now wish to talk to you about, the Commission went to great lengths to ensure that the 2020 Strategy places more emphasis on social aspects, as well as on education."
"It was not easy, however."
"Some governments were saying that, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, it was not up to Europe or the European Union to take direct action on social aspects and education."
"Let us now try, within the framework of the 2020 Strategy - where it was nonetheless possible to reach a certain consensus on the inclusion, for instance, of the fight against poverty and social exclusion - to develop this policy, and also to encourage investment, particularly in education and innovation."
"However, in that respect, let me tell you something that you may not be aware of."
"The Commission suggested, some time ago - two years ago I think - that emergency food aid be provided for some Europeans, because there are now people in Europe, too, who do not have enough to eat."
"Recently, I, together with Joseph Daul, Chair of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), visited the food bank here in the Bas-Rhin."
"There are poverty-related problems in Europe."
"Well, did you know that two governments took the Commission to the Court of Justice because the Commission had put in place a mechanism for helping the poorest in Europe?"
"That is the situation."
"Let us be absolutely clear."
"The Commission is in favour of a Europe that is more ambitious with regard to governance; it is in favour of fair growth and of more social justice at European level."
"However, at the same time, we need to have Parliament and the Member States on board."
"And we have to fight for that."
"Therefore, in my opinion, to criticise the Commission really would be to choose the wrong target, since it spearheaded the fight for a more social, fairer Europe and for much more credible governance."
"At the same time, let us be absolutely clear on this as well."
"I do not think it helps Europe to say that the current problem is Europe's problem, as if the responsibility did not lie at all with certain governments, which let their debt reach unsustainable levels or their banks have growth several times that of their gross domestic product."
"Governments are also partly responsible."
"That responsibility is essential."
"That is why we must now find solutions based on solidarity, but also act responsibly."
"That is why, for instance, I am proud that the Commission and I have supported the proposal aimed at lowering the interest rates paid by Greece, and we are doing the same thing now for Ireland."
"We think that this is the right thing to do, not only to avoid imposing extremely heavy costs on our Greek and Irish fellow citizens, but also to ensure that the debt is sustainable."
"Consequently, it is in that spirit of solidarity and responsibility that we can find common answers that will also enable us, I hope, to avoid a problem that some of you have alluded to and which concerns me, namely the problem of a certain division in Europe, in particular a division between North and South, between centre and periphery."
"I think that the Europe that we want to build is a Europe of solidarity, not a first-class and second-class Europe, but a Europe with which all Europeans can identify."
"I have already defended, in word and in deed, the financial transaction tax in the G20 on behalf of the European Union."
"This was rejected by a huge number of our G20 partners."
"The question that we are now discussing is whether, at European level, we can - or we should - have a financial transaction tax or not."
"Let us be honest, once again."
"Several Member States fundamentally oppose it."
"They will not agree."
"What I said at the last European Council was that the Commission is now making impact assessments of different options for the financial sector and will soon come forward with proposals."
"It was very important that the Commission made that announcement to the European Council because at least in the conclusions of the European Council there is a commitment to look at the proposals that the Commission will put forward for financial taxation."
"I believe that, in terms of justice, it is important that the financial sector - and to a large extent at least some of the behaviour in the financial sector was at the origin of this crisis - also contributes to the response to the crisis."
"I think this is basic in terms of fairness."
"That is my own position and, I have no doubt, the position of the Commission."
"I will come forward with proposals on this matter."
"The same goes for the CCCTB."
"There is some opposition in some quarters in the Council, but the Commission has put forward the proposal and we will fight for it because we believe the CCCTB is important for the completion of the single market."
"This is exactly the approach we are defending."
"We have been discussing process and instruments for a very long time."
"Now is the time to put process and instruments at the service of the substance."
"Process and instruments are important, but they are at the service of the substance and cannot substitute for it."
"The challenge we need to resolve is our economic renewal."
"The truth is that, in order to be able to invest, we need confidence."
"Confidence depends on our capacity to modernise, to innovate and to become more sustainable and more competitive."
"Let us not confuse cause and effect."
"Investment will be attracted if we implement Europe 2020 quickly and decisively, and if we pursue our goals of a Europe that is sustainable and competitive in the spirit of solidarity and also in solidarity with all the Member States, including Portugal."
"(FR) Mr Schulz, you know very well that in my capacity as President of the Commission, I cannot interfere in Portuguese domestic policy."
"If one day you cease being Chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and you have other duties, I am sure that you will carry out those new duties completely independently and that you will not interfere in your group's internal matters."
"However, at the same time, I have to tell you that a political crisis in Portugal has not made things any easier, since Portugal was already in a rather difficult situation."
"Despite this, we the European institutions also need to respect national democracy and the decisions of national parliaments, and we now hope that Portugal will find the best way out of this."
"In any case, the Commission stands by Portugal in helping it find the best solutions in accordance, of course, with the commitments it has made and with certain responsibilities it has towards its European partners."
"I believe that it is in this spirit of active solidarity and responsibility that we can tackle the crisis."
"It is true that there have been rather pessimistic views expressed here today."
"Moreover, as Europeans' elected representatives, you reflect the dominant feeling in Europe."
"While it is only natural that we are concerned, I think that we should have the political courage and perceptiveness to show confidence in our European project, because I do not believe that we will be able to restore confidence in Europe by being pessimistic."
"The Commission is ready to carry on working enthusiastically with you, with the European Council, with the Council, with all the institutions, towards a stronger, more sustainable, fairer and more competitive Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, honourable Members, I am pleased to be able to speak to such a full House, the fullest since I became President of the Council,"
"(Applause)"
"but I have the impression that you have not just come here to listen to me."
"First of all, I would like to thank you for all your comments, both positive and negative."
"I was struck all the more because, within the European Council, we have to have unanimity, and we try to have unanimity between all your colleagues, from all your parties, Prime Ministers and Heads of State."
"There are Socialists, Christian Democrats, Conservatives, Liberals, all belonging to your political families, and every time, we try and secure agreements between them."
"Someone said earlier that I must be the idealist around here, the dream maker."
"I do not think that is my role, but what I try to do, at least, wherever possible - and the President of the Commission can testify to this - is to act in such a way that in most cases, we end up with a convergence between the Commission proposals and the outcome of the European Council."
"Let me mention the example of the task force, where the Commission proposals were the basis of the task force on economic governance, and where the outcome is very close to the Commission proposals."
"And I will try, we will try with Parliament, to improve these proposals still further."
"My role, then, is to seek a consensus, but one that is also based as far as possible on the Community, and I think that in some crucial areas, I have succeeded in doing that."
"Now to the 'Euro Plus Pact' - you know, the short paper that served as a starting point for our discussions, and the final Euro Plus Pact document - many of you, even those who belong to sceptical political groups, have said that their country should join the Euro Plus Pact."
"This is probably because it is not so bad after all."
"We have succeeded in reaching a compromise between ambitious objectives, so that economies remain competitive and public finances remain sustainable, and implementation at national level, because in most cases, the decisions we must take are national ones."
"My second observation concerns methodology, if you will."
"Many criticisms in relation to Europe are justified in terms of substance, but are not in line with the Treaty."
"For example, the whole nuclear policy, the Energy Mix, comes under national jurisdiction and there is nothing I can do to change that."
"Even safety and security of nuclear installations come for the most part under national jurisdiction."
"There are Community competences, European competences, and in the conclusions of the European Council, we tried to promote them as much as possible."
"I do not think that the Commission has ever had such an important role in nuclear security as it has since the European Council of a few days ago."
"However, we still need to work within the framework of the Treaty."
"People have talked about minimum wages in some countries, but that is a national competence."
"People have talked about inequalities, job insecurity, injustice, yet in most cases, these are measures that are part of a national framework."
"However, I would like to add that many measures which need to be taken now regarding competitiveness and public finances are measures that national governments ought in fact to have taken, even without European pressure."
"Europe is exerting additional pressure because there is, for 17 countries at least, a Community currency that needs defending."
"In most countries, however, the required measures need to be taken for the country's own interest, for its own nationals, to safeguard its own future."
"And Europe is bringing additional pressure to bear."
"Therefore let us not level any unfounded accusations against the European Union."
"Are our governance measures too weak?"
"Well, the Council will work with the European Parliament to improve economic governance and, as in other cases, I am certain that compromises will be found."
"It may be that there is a governor of a central bank of one of the 17 countries who has a number of criticisms in relation to economic governance, but I can quote other governors or bank directors of countries close to the Netherlands who have an altogether different opinion."
"If necessary, I can give you the names and the quotations: that is the easiest way to work."
"As for the current crisis, honourable Members, there is the future, and there are instruments on which important decisions have been taken, but there is of course the past."
"As I have already said, the past needs to be managed."
"Even with the best instruments that we can come up with - the facility, the stability mechanism, changing the Treaty, economic governance, the pact - we will not solve the problems of the countries that are struggling, we will not solve the problems of the banks that are still under pressure."
"So there is the future and there is the past."
"Concerning the past, there was a lack of policy in some Member States and at European level."
"We need to be self-critical there."
"However, what we need to ensure and will ensure, and we have already taken the necessary measures, is that this crisis does not happen again in the future."
"In the meantime, as I have already said, we have to manage the legacy of the past, both regarding certain countries that you know about and which are in the programme - such as Greece and Ireland - and regarding other countries where we are taking measures to prevent them from going into the programme."
"Could we have taken those measures a year ago?"
"No!"
"Have there been major errors in the past?"
"We undermined the Stability and Growth Pact seven or eight years ago."
"If we had not done that, we would have had much more effective instruments and we could have prevented many crises."
"With regard to economic growth, honourable Members, since 2010 it has averaged 2%, which is the average for the decade between 1999 and 2008."
"We had economic growth in 2010, and it is averaging 2% in 2011."
"Should we do more?"
"Of course we should."
"Are public investments the only instrument?"
"Not at all!"
"The internal market, the single market is extremely important."
"It must be developed further."
"There are Commission proposals on the table, and they will be discussed again in a few weeks, at the June European Council, and we will return to this matter again in the autumn."
"Finally, on the subject of Libya, many criticisms can be levelled at us."
"However, without Europe, without European leadership, there would have been a bloodbath in Libya."
"Without Europe, there would have been massacres."
"Some of you have been very critical of the European Union."
"Yet we acted in time!"
"And without Europe, nothing would have been done at global level, at United Nations level."
"After all the criticisms that have been voiced, I believe that we also have the right to hear that truth."
"Did we get things wrong in the past?"
"Did we adopt the right policies?"
"No!"
"Did we correct our mistakes?"
"Yes!"
"And the European Union deserves credit for correcting them."
"(Applause)"
"I should like to say one last thing in my own language."
"(NL) I just listened to Mr Eppink, who declared that he felt let down."
"I, too, feel let down by so much intellectual dishonesty."
"I will not go into it further, but for Mr Eppink to stand there waving a photograph knowing full well that I was there in my official capacity and that that was not my personal conviction, well, I have to say that I feel very let down by him."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to make a personal observation at the end of this debate."
"I am speaking not just for myself, but on behalf of many of my colleagues who were here the whole time and who followed this debate."
"In all my time here at the European Parliament I have rarely felt as badly treated as today in the interplay between you and Mr Barroso."
"I want to be very clear on this."
"Mr Barroso, you have told us: 'The initiatives open to me, which have the support of the vast majority in this house, fail because the Member States reject them.'"
"Let me offer you a word of advice: place your initiatives on the table in the form of draft legislation."
"That way you will get a majority in this House and the Council will no longer have any hiding space."
"(Applause)"
"I would ask you to please stop hiding behind the Council."
"To you, Mr Van Rompuy, I would say this: you tell us that you have succeeded in reaching compromises between socialists, liberals, conservatives and Christian democrats at Council level."
"The Council is made up of sovereign ministers of state and prime ministers."
"Here we witness a President of the Council trying to turn the Treaty of Lisbon in the opposite direction."
"The result of the Treaty of Lisbon is that the Council of Heads of State or Government is drawing more and more power to itself, while at the same time saying: 'our decisions are made on a unanimous basis.'"
"This was not what the Treaty of Lisbon was about."
"Lisbon wanted majority decision-making to be the norm within the EU."
"You are misinterpreting the Treaty of Lisbon."
"(Applause)"
"For this reason it is high time for the European Parliament to take the matter in hand itself and to defend the Community method."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (NL) The EU has made a quantum leap forward in recent weeks in relation to economic integration."
"The Euro Plus Pact puts us on track for ramped-up cooperation that still has respect for the traditions of social consultation as they exist in the Member States."
"Of course, the work in this respect must not stop."
"We now have to get phase 2 up and running and pave the way for European investment projects that will also enable us to make our Europe 2020 agenda a reality."
"Commission President Barroso has promised that he will bring forward a proposal on the introduction of a financial transactions tax."
"We must harness these funds in order to make vitally necessary cross-border investments, specifically in energy infrastructure, backed up by European project bonds and money for public/private partnerships."
"That is the only way to convince the citizens that Europe, more than ever, is their guarantee of a prosperous future."
"The last European Council meeting, which took place on 24 and 25 March, focused on the major economic and diplomatic challenges that the European Union is currently facing: the issues of Libya and Japan."
"Despite there being signs of economic recovery, the situation remains difficult, and the end of the economic crisis still seems a long way off."
"This may be seen in the case of Portugal, which has unfortunately ended up having to join Ireland and Greece in requesting economic and financial aid."
"It is therefore important to adopt the necessary economic and financial measures for dealing with the crisis, for preventing cases of indebtedness like in Greece, Ireland and Portugal being repeated, and for strengthening economic governance within the EU and ensuring job creation."
"A package of six measures has been adopted, which from the start appear to me to be positive and to have quite ambitious expectations, such as the establishment of a European Stability Mechanism, the Euro Plus Pact, and so on. I hope that these can be implemented as quickly as possible, so that they can begin to produce the results that are so necessary and hoped for."
"in writing. - (RO) The Euro Plus Pact and European Stability Mechanism will provide Member States with the financial assistance they need in return for closer coordination of their economic policies."
"Both proposals offer therefore a constructive pair of measures, especially in view of the proposal for coordinating taxation policies, which is an essential reform in a union of states seeking to share the same currency."
"Furthermore, the European Stability Mechanism, thanks to its intervention facility of EUR 500 billion, operates like a European Monetary Fund, authorised to borrow money and purchase bonds directly from states, while countering financial speculation at the same time."
"However, certain proposals in the Pact are unworkable."
"Fiscal austerity and making the labour market extremely flexible will delay economic growth, keep unemployment at high levels and create labour instability."
"I think that gradual fiscal consolidation and safeguarding the European social model are needed to lay the foundations for sound economic growth."
"in writing. - Much has been said in this plenary session on the effect of the bailout package on the Republic of Ireland."
"However, it must be recognised that this crisis also has a huge knock-on effect on my own constituency of Northern Ireland, which shares a land border with the Republic."
"There is a large quantity of cross border movement in terms of finance, services and people for employment purposes."
"Banking institutions from the Republic of Ireland also have a considerable stake in Northern Ireland."
"Therefore the liquidity problem these banks are now facing are directly impacting on businesses in Northern Ireland, particularly SMEs, in terms of access to financing."
"At a time when SMEs are struggling to survive an already dire economic climate, this is only helping to depress a difficult situation."
"At present, 30 per cent of everything manufactured or produced in Northern Ireland goes directly to market in the Republic of Ireland."
"Therefore a weak market in the Republic has direct and serious ramifications for business and employment in my constituency."
"In light of this serious situation I call on President Barroso to acknowledge this and use the taskforce to look at ways to improve the situation we now find ourselves in."
"in writing. - (PT) The last European Council meeting took a set of decisions that, if they are implemented, will constitute an unusual, violent and dangerous attack on the workers and peoples of Europe, given substance within the renamed 'Euro Plus Pact'."
"It has surely been renamed in order to conceal its true authors - Germany and France - given that the previous name, the 'competitiveness pact', would immediately give them away."
"Alongside so-called 'economic governance', this is an attack on Member States that are in a more vulnerable position from an economic and social point of view, with this being a veritable sentence of economic dependence and backwardness."
"Both instruments are linked to the announced amendment - using the simplified procedure and without holding any referenda - to the Treaty of Lisbon, with the aim of introducing the so-called 'conditionality' associated with the European Stability Mechanism."
"According to the Council's conclusions, this is 'strict policy conditionality under a macro-economic adjustment programme', a process that will be developed and implemented jointly by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund."
"Essentially, we are going through a process of concentration of political and economic power, now not only in the hands of a directorate of powers in the service of big business and finance, but also in the hands of the very institutions of international capital."
"in writing. - (HU) It is important that in a difficult, critical period in the life of the whole of Europe we appraise the objectives ahead of us and the positive changes made towards them together."
"The current Hungarian Presidency has scored a striking success for the second time in the areas of economic governance, the stability mechanism and the European Semester."
"In the series of talks that took place in the context of its last meeting at the end of March, the European Council managed to agree on the limited amendment of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as well, the purpose of which was to enhance the stability of the euro area and the euro."
"At the Council meeting the Hungarian Presidency voted in favour of a rational, responsible economic policy that can be abided by, and apart from the institutionalisation of the European Semester, also strengthened the stability mechanism."
"However, we need to point out that the elements of economic governance are not to be confused in any way with the Euro Plus Pact, which is an intergovernmental agreement at its current stage."
"Although it is possible that the Pact is good, the single internal market cannot be regulated by non-contractual intergovernmental agreements."
"Due to an unclarified point in the Pact concerning tax harmonisation, Hungary does not wish to apply the agreement in its entirety for the time being because we have an interest in enhancing our competitive advantage, and through this in real job creation in the long term and economic growth."
"in writing. - (LV) I take considerable pleasure from the fact that 23 EU Member States have been able to agree on a package of measures for safeguarding financial stability and promoting growth - the Euro Plus Pact."
"Also of importance is the agreement that has been reached on structural reform and fiscal consolidation and the final resolution on the amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon for the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism."
"All countries must implement fiscal consolidation measures and measures aimed at preventing macroeconomic disequilibrium."
"Structural reforms to promote employment and social inclusion must also be implemented."
"They must be defined according to each country's particular situation."
"The participation of 23 European countries in this pact leads us to hope that these measures will encourage economic growth."
"This is a step in the right direction and a sensible response to those economic challenges."
"This pact fits splendidly with the work of Parliament and the Commission on improvements to the single market and the three reports that we are approving in Parliament this week."
"We must take even bolder decisions."
"Member State governments must not seize the pretext of the electoral cycle in order to put off taking important but unpopular decisions."
"The European Council that took place on 24-25 March made a number of decisions which I believe to be important and which could not be put off any longer."
"I think that the most important decision in connection with European economic policy is the Euro Plus Pact, which provides a common agenda and common objectives."
"The four main objectives are: promoting competitiveness, promoting employment, increasing the sustainability of public sector funding and restoring financial stability."
"As a result of this pact, several other Member States have joined the euro area; for example, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Denmark, Romania and Bulgaria."
"I think that it is extremely important at the present time to reach common agreements involving the application of equal rules as well as common mechanisms for achieving the desired objectives."
"I especially want to recognise those Member States who are not members of the euro area but who have still joined this pact."
"It is to be hoped that the application of common rules will be accompanied by the harmonisation of national perceptions, and this particularly relates to the sustainability of public sector funding with a view to preventing the situations that engulfed Greece and Ireland from arising in the future."
"At the same time, we cannot just stop at these decisions, as they will only provide short-term results."
"It is necessary to develop solutions for making future investments, whether through eurobonds or through other solutions. Thank you."
"in writing. - (PL) The recent European Council summit marks the opening of a new phase - one of greater economic coordination and convergence in the EU and the euro area."
"The Euro Plus Pact adopted by the Heads of State or Government, with the involvement of the countries in the euro area and Bulgaria, Denmark, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Romania, provides us with a real chance of achieving the objectives set out in it, or in other words supporting competitiveness, employment, the stability of public finances and financial stability in general."
"It is worth highlighting the fact that the Pact does not specify the political or economic measures to be used in order to achieve these objectives, which means that it will still be up to the individual Member States to choose suitable means of doing so."
"There can be no doubt that the success or failure of the Pact will be determined by the genuine involvement of the Member States and how effectively their progress is monitored."
"When it comes to economic coordination, the EU can no longer afford a failure such as that suffered by the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Consent was also given at the summit to the inclusion in the Treaty of a provision establishing a permanent European Stability Mechanism, mobilised with the joint agreement of the Member States in the event that it is necessary to ensure the stability of the euro area as a whole."
"This is a very important decision, particularly in light of the recent problems faced by countries in the euro area."
"A permanent mechanism enshrined in the Treaty will act as a solid guarantee in the event of similar problems in the future, thus also reducing the risk of speculative attacks on the European currency."
"I also welcome the fact that the mechanism has been opened up for Member States outside the euro area."
"in writing. - (PL) We will only be able to combat the crisis effectively if we work together, avoiding any division into countries which belong to the euro area and those which remain outside it."
"It is hard to imagine a more competitive EU being built without the participation of countries such as the United Kingdom, Sweden or Poland, so I welcome the news that the Euro Plus Pact has been adopted."
"To begin with, our impression was that the euro area planned not only to reform itself, but what is more to introduce reforms outside EU structures, which was a cause of some concern to MEPs."
"These fears were however successfully dispelled, and an uncompromising stance was taken on Parliament's behalf."
"The only regrettable thing is that the Member States did not adopt it in its entirety, particularly with regard to the European Stability Mechanism, which in our opinion should be open to countries outside the euro area from the outset."

"The next item is the vote."
"(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"(DA) Mr President, the most recent internal tensions and unrest in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and other Arab countries have led to huge migration flows with their associated challenges for Europe."
"Obviously, we must be ready to deal with these situations and these flows of people."
"We need to find a way of doing this together by ensuring, in solidarity with one another, that we meet the challenges that arise when our common system is put under pressure from the outside world."
"I am therefore pleased that Parliament has today adopted a policy for dealing with migration flows arising from instability."
"I am particularly pleased that Parliament's resolution places the focus on strengthening the role of the border agency, FRONTEX."
"That is something that we in the Danish Liberal Party have been fighting for for a very long time."
"During the current crisis in North Africa, FRONTEX has proven to be a particularly important instrument for dealing with migration flows in the region."
"Now all we need is for FRONTEX to be able to swing into action more quickly when it ultimately counts."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of this report because it represents a first step towards an EU policy on migration flows arising from instability."
"In this regard it is important that this Parliament speaks out against this hysterical vision of a looming invasion of migrants and asylum seekers coming from the South."
"We are not going to be overwhelmed by millions of people escaping political deprivation and tyrannies."
"Many people are afraid that asylum seekers are arriving in greater numbers, straining our buckling welfare systems."
"This claim is good to gain votes and build support for harsh immigration policies, but it is not backed by the facts."
"The overall number of people claiming asylum in the West dropped by more than 40% over the past decade according to data just released by the United Nations."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I also supported and voted in favour of Mr Provera's report because I think it offers a practical, assertive step forward towards the goal of solidarity, which is moreover provided for by Article 80 on solidarity amongst European Union Member States."
"It also pays clear and explicit attention to those that find themselves in great difficulty, such as North Africa in particular at this time."
"Respect for human rights, international cooperation and bilateral relations are essential, as too are regional organisations such as the Arab League and the African Union, which can provide added value in a stable, lasting peace process."
"We trust that the steps ahead will also be characterised by actions in similar areas that promote, in economic terms, entities that need to be supported and assisted towards sustained and continuous growth."
"(FI) Mr President, I would like to say that migration flows arising from instability are a real challenge for the European Union."
"This is about the individual fate of human beings, in which every person's story is different."
"They are on the move through desperation, but what unites them all is hope for something better."
"Europe needs to show sympathy and a willingness to help."
"European integration is a successful, common project through which we have created prosperity, stability and security - a sort of cradle of wellbeing."
"It will be difficult and expensive to respond to this wave of immigration after it starts rapping on the doors of Europe."
"The example provided by the island of Lampedusa shows how foreign policy security matters can become internal policy in an instant, and that is why development cooperation alone is no longer enough."
"Europe needs a comprehensive, preventive plan that covers aspects of security, regional cooperation, trade policy, climate change, the protection of human rights and the development of democracy."
"This is what we need to do."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the European debate on migration flows. one often hears: 'What problems can a country of nearly 60 million people such as Italy have in accommodating a few tens of thousands of immigrants?'."
"This question disregards two pieces of information, often for ulterior motives."
"Firstly, many of these immigrants want to end up in other EU countries."
"Secondly, in the last two years, less than 4 000 people have arrived on Italy's shores, thanks to bilateral agreements with Libya and Tunisia."
"In the past two months following the political crisis, 22 000 people have already arrived."
"Italy is a pressure cooker right now."
"On the one hand, the flow of migrants from North Africa, particularly economic migrants from Tunisia, is not coming to a halt."
"On the other hand, France is rejecting immigrants at Ventimiglia because they do not hold residence permits."
"If European solidarity does exist, now is the time to show it by working together at EU level to decide how to deal with these flows, both in the current emergency and in the long term, as well as which instruments to use in dealing with those arriving in Europe and what measures to adopt in countries of origin."
"This text is an initial step in this direction and I therefore voted in its favour."
"Mr President, on a point of order: we are in a Chamber which is meant for discourse, and we obviously all have to show respect for one another."
"When you have two group Chairs having a private conversation while others are giving speeches, what message does that send out to their colleagues?"
"Mr Daul and Mr Schulz, I have been asked whether you could set an example to the House."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measure we have voted on today is of some help in clarifying the phenomenon of migration flows and praises the work of Frontex."
"I think this should be seen positively and therefore so should the result of the vote."
"I do, however, believe that this stance should be accompanied by equal clarity on the part of the Member States, because this challenge affects not only the European Institutions but also policy in the Member States."
"I must say, however, that so far not all Member States have implemented and practiced such clarity, starting with the policy of the Italian Government, which has dealt with the situation in Lampedusa in a most objectionable and questionable manner."
"Thousands of migrants there have been essentially abandoned to their fate, whilst human solidarity - never mind legal solidarity - would have led to immediate care and certainly greater respect than has been shown, notwithstanding the fact that the legal problem would then have to be dealt with, as we have done in this House."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while it is true that many migration flows arise from instability, we are rather reluctant to use such a mistaken term, because instability really means war, genocide, uncontrolled violence, revolutions and the misery to which these people have been condemned, whilst the European Union remains silent."
"There is also the desire for freedom."
"The resolution that we have voted on calls for a Union policy for the East and its most appropriate instruments to address various factors that cause this instability."
"I wonder what credibility this foreign policy can have, given that events in Libya and North Africa have demonstrated the total lack of an EU foreign policy."
"The governments of the Member States each acted on their own behalf, offering a pitiful spectacle to the world and the people that we should be helping."
"The only refugee reception policy the Union could offer fell well short of requirements."
"The island of Lampedusa and Italy were left without any answers."
"Therefore we are certainly voting in favour of this measure, but we urge the Union to finally come up with a foreign policy worthy of the name."
"(NL) Mr President, I abstained from the vote on the Provera report, primarily because I think that it is greatly lacking in clarity."
"All kinds of things are stated and proposed in this report - some of them even sensible ideas, which is unusual in this Parliament."
"Yet, sadly enough, it remains primarily a report offering total political correctness that nowhere - not in a single place, not in a single paragraph or a single clause - ventures to question the new mass immigration into an already overpopulated continent of Europe, as this relates predominantly to the countries that used to make up what was known as Western Europe but is also a fundamental issue."
"My own country of Flanders is the most densely populated country in the whole of the European Union."
"The overwhelming majority of Flemings do not want any new immigration, and certainly not from countries with cultures and religions that advocate values that are completely at odds with our own."
"It is high time that the European Parliament listened for once to its own European citizens."
"Mr President, I agree that we should take measures in the short term to address the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean, ensuring the dignity of the people concerned using instruments such as Frontex."
"We also need a long-term vision to solve the problems related to migration flows and to help create jobs in the countries of origin of these people."
"On of the European Union's key tools is trade policy."
"The time has come to improve the openness of our markets, starting with countries like Egypt and Tunisia."
"We also need to establish dialogue with a view to strengthening the regional trade relationship."
"We have the example of Turkey and its success both with its customs union and in effectively implementing the necessary democratic reforms."
"We have to start daring to talk about custom unions and free-trade agreements with the countries of the Mediterranean that are moving towards democracy and reforms."
"I would like to finish by calling on the Council to adopt without further delay the Regional Convention on preferential Pan-Euro-Med rules of origin."
"Mr President, the premise of this report is incorrect."
"The idea that emigration is a product of poverty and desperation, although superficially plausible, turns out to be specious."
"Emigration, we know historically, more often is the product of rising wealth and rising aspiration."
"We saw very recently that the great migratory flows from Tunisia came after the restoration of democracy and the end of dictatorship."
"The real cause which uproots people and makes them shift themselves hundreds of miles in pursuit of a better life is opportunity."
"The reality is that in the European Union we have created a situation where we have long-scale structural unemployment and yet are still are having to import labour."
"In our country, the United Kingdom, there are more than 4 million people who are either unemployed or on incapacity benefit and yet every month we are bringing people in from all over the world to do jobs that are not being taken by people born in the United Kingdom."
"We have trapped millions in the squalor of dependency."
"We have placed them in a situation where work is no longer part of their mental horizon."
"If we want to rescue people from that wretched condition, the answer is not in foreign policy but in reform of welfare, so as to restore dignity and independence to our own citizens."
"Mr President, one of the factors that is often overlooked in any debate on migration is that quite often it is very difficult for those who migrate from one country to another, and they do so under the most difficult of circumstances."
"Think what it must be like to leave behind your family, your village, your town, all your social ties, your friends, maybe never knowing whether you will see them again or when you will see them again."
"What makes them leave those countries and seek opportunity, as the previous speaker said, in the West?"
"Well, quite often it is because they are escaping from conditions and governments that are no longer able to command their confidence."
"We can help in some ways."
"Let us look at some of the policies that we have: our fisheries policy, which encourages large fishing boats to plunder the seas off poor African nations, leaving their local fishermen in desperation with no jobs."
"What do they do then?"
"They seek to migrate."
"We have our aid policy, which keeps corrupt governments in power, making it less pleasant for people to stay in their countries."
"That makes people look to go abroad and they come here."
"We have to get this right."
"We have to understand that it is difficult for people to leave their own countries."
"We should make sure that our policies help people to stay in their own countries."
"(DA) Mr President, for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe it is absolutely crucial that we secure the same rights and opportunities not only for the women, but also for the men of rural areas as are enjoyed by those who live in towns."
"If we want to maintain a stronger European agricultural sector that is able to supply good quality food to the whole of Europe we need to ensure that this sector is attractive to both workers and families."
"For this to be possible, it is necessary for us to give rural areas the opportunity for growth, innovation, jobs and development."
"It is not necessary for us to impose quotas and unnatural gender distributions on the sector."
"Therefore, it is also a good thing that Parliament has today adopted the report on the role of women in agriculture and rural areas, thereby sending a very clear signal that, here too, women play an important role."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, women have always had an important role in the agricultural and rural sector."
"Indeed, women account for 42% of the labour force out of a total of around 27 million workers."
"Despite this high percentage, women are not well represented in sector organisations and face discrimination in the decision-making process."
"There are many areas in which women's circumstances could be improved, including ensuring adequate social cover."
"The European institutions should therefore act to balance this inequality, perhaps by monitoring the sector through an observatory for female entrepreneurialism in agriculture, as already operated in Calabria and other regions in Italy."
"The report voted upon today - which I supported - also takes a long hard look at the issue of the exodus from the countryside."
"In order to help keep employment levels steady we need support policies and strategies which are designed to build infrastructure and create services suited to the requirements of modern life, which can be implemented in rural areas."
"(DE) Mr President, life and work have changed radically in rural areas through the transformation of society, changes in social structure and dramatic demographic change."
"If it is our aim to keep women of all generations on the land or to encourage them to choose a rural lifestyle, then their needs and requirements must be taken into greater consideration in development policy."
"We should bear in mind that the realities for women in rural areas have changed in recent years and are very highly differentiated."
"Women themselves have played a part in initiating and shaping this change, both as individuals and in women's political groupings."
"I believe that our rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, has correctly highlighted this fact, which is why I believe this report is extremely important."
"After all, if we want to develop rural areas, we cannot simply concentrate on building up infrastructure and creating an environment for tourism, but also need to ensure that families settle there again, something that involves both women and men in equal measure."
"(PL) Mr President, I endorsed the Jeggle report, not least because it recommends ensuring appropriate funding for the European Union's agricultural policy."
"The trend towards make savings in the EU budget, which is otherwise entirely apposite, must not be followed at the expense of the common agricultural policy."
"If rural areas and agriculture in the European Union do not receive appropriate assistance, it will be hard to improve the role of women in rural areas, it will be hard to encourage women to live in rural areas under such difficult conditions, and it will be hard to achieve the objectives of this key policy, such as food security, environmental protection and territorial balance."
"We should remember this, and I would like to take the opportunity afforded by the debate on this key report by Mrs Jeggle to call once again for the wish to make savings in the European Union not to be granted at the expense of the common agricultural policy."
"(ES) Mr President, I voted for this report because it helps to combat the invisibility which until now has characterised the work of and role played by women in rural areas."
"Without this contribution, it would not have been possible, in the past or in the present, to maintain population and employment outside urban areas."
"This visibility should lead not only to social recognition but also to provision."
"The common agricultural policy must include a focus on gender in its aid programmes, with special initiatives for female entrepreneurship."
"In addition, it must help fund services and promote aspects such as Internet access in rural areas, which promote equality of living conditions in urban and in rural areas."
"For their part, the social security systems of the Member States must recognise women's work in this sphere, both in terms of production and care, especially in the care of dependents and children."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the fact that women account for 42% of 26 to 27 million workers and that 29% of agricultural businesses are run by women, their industry-level representation is almost non-existent and at odds with their importance."
"This is not right or normal, so the Union needs to give women a greater role in the rural sector and find suitable solutions for the combination of economic activities that they carry out."
"Gender equality, equal treatment, social protection for mothers and recognition of the specific role that women play in agriculture are what is required."
"Promoting continuous training is therefore one of the core issues on which we can no longer compromise."
"We support the proposals of the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, on better representation for women in all political, economic and social bodies in the agricultural sector, and on support for social protection initiatives for women working as small farmers, farm workers and seasonal animal rearers."
"Women must be acknowledged specifically within the common agricultural policy, otherwise this reform will be useless and it is quite certain that we will not be able to imagine an untroubled future with fresh cuts in agriculture."
"Mr President, I do not know whether you recall the popular television series in our own country Life on Mars, the conceit of which was that the leading character, a police officer, is catapulted back, as it seems, to the early 1970s."
"I felt rather as he did as I read through the voting list today."
"Here is the EU coming out with policies on women in agriculture, export credits for favoured companies, special grants to Unilever in the Czech Republic and to machine tool manufacturers in Poland."
"The 1970s was a dire period for Europe as a whole and for the United Kingdom in particular: a time of stagflation, of unemployment, of national bankruptcy."
"But these things did not happen because of some tectonic forces beyond our control."
"They happened as a result of wrong-headed policy, in particular the idea that governments could pick winners, and that governments should control the economy and make things happen through reallocating resources."
"The 27 Member States have moved on, but the European Union has not."
"We are still in this world of taking money from our taxpayers and giving them to favoured client groups."
"Why?"
"Because if we did not do that, what would the European Union be for?"
"As Upton Sinclair once observed, it is very difficult to make a man see something when his job depends upon not seeing it."
"- (SK) Mr President, it is right and proper that the submitted report sets out to improve the position of women in rural areas."
"Unfortunately, however, it views women only as workers or entrepreneurs."
"It does not see women in the role of mothers, nor the value of the informal and therefore unpaid work of women."
"However, the work of women at home and caring for dependent family members also makes a significant contribution to the wellbeing of society."
"This work accounts for up to one third of GDP in European countries, and yet we always pretend it does not exist."
"Instead of clearly acknowledging this asset, we put pressure on women to get jobs and go into business."
"At the same time, it is precisely in agriculture and rural areas that valuing the work of women would improve the quality of life for families and communities."
"(DA) Mr President, it should always be up to each individual Member State to decide on its own energy mix."
"In light of that fact, it is also clearly the case that each individual Member State should cover the costs if it wants to phase out one of the elements of that mix."
"However, in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria, in particular, there were a number of nuclear power plants from the Soviet era that were a long way from meeting our safety requirements."
"It was therefore also necessary and sensible to support the decommissioning of these plants."
"The problem is that the planning that was carried out there, or more accurately the lack of planning, quite simply must not be repeated."
"We can see that, by the end of 2013, we will have spent a total of EUR 3 billion, and we have still not managed to decommission the plants."
"That is a sign of poor planning."
"The Commission must produce a detailed analysis of the financial efficiency of the projects, because any future support must be conditional upon the countries being able to demonstrate that they have managed their current funds properly."
"- (SK) Mr President, the submitted report on the state of funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants provides a good picture of the situation to date."
"I fully agree with one of the key conclusions of the report, that the decommissioning of these facilities in the countries affected will also require European funding contributions after 2013."
"It will not be within the power of the affected countries to fund this exclusively from their own sources."
"For example, Slovakia, under pressure from the EU, decommissioned two fully reconstructed blocks of the Jaslovské Bohunice nuclear plant in 2006 and 2008."
"According to the conclusions of the International Atomic Energy Agency, these blocks fulfilled all of the safety criteria."
"The economic impacts of this step are considerable, and will be further multiplied by the high long-term costs for the complete decommissioning of these facilities."
"The European Union will also have to make provision for funds to support the decommissioning of the nuclear plants in the financial perspective for the years 2013-2020."
"(PL) Mr President, energy policy, and above all energy security in the broadest meaning of the word, is a subject provoking heated discussion in every corner of the globe in the light of recent events in Japan."
"The disaster at the Fukushima nuclear power station showed how much work we need to do to create an energy supply system which is efficient and environmentally-friendly, but above all safe."
"This is a problem not only for Asia, but for every country on every continent."
"If nuclear power stations exist which should be closed for safety reasons, let us do everything in our power to ensure that this takes place and efficiently."
"Let us provide support for all measures resulting in the creation of new and safe energy sources, and when taking decisions let our overriding priority always be public safety. Thank you very much."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that a report such as Mr Marinescu's could not but find support and agreement, even in a situation still characterised by the emotional outpouring following the events in Fukushima."
"Mr Marinescu's absolutely balanced and prudent approach to the document led me to support it in any case."
"Furthermore, there is no doubt that the commitment to Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria must be sustained and consistent, whilst at the same time a series of other activities - those simply called 'stress tests' and also all those tests designed with safety in mind - ought to guarantee safety in the nuclear sector."
"There is no margin for error, for reasons we know all too well."
"The financing programmes had already been planned for some time and they have been assured."
"We trust in the positive and concrete outcome for the entire operation, which signals a step forwards in the direction we all wanted."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of providing adequate financial resources to guarantee the decommissioning of nuclear power plants has already been tackled by European Union legislation on the safety of the nuclear sector."
"Today, in the light of recent international events and the consequent decisions of the governments of the Member States in this regard, the issue is highly topical."
"We have expressed our backing for Mr Marinescu's work, which deals with the specific cases of a number of countries which, upon accession, took on particular obligations on decommissioning nuclear power plants and received special support from the European Union for this very activity."
"Specific cases aside, on this issue we are duty-bound to establish an effective monitoring system to check and test the nuclear plants within EU territory."
"Indeed, the number of reactors that are thought to need to be decommissioned in EU territory in the near future is rather high."
"It will therefore be essential - including and above all in such cases -, to ensure the provision of guarantee mechanisms for setting aside adequate financial resources required to tackle both ordinary and extraordinary requirements."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a staunch supporter of the anti-nuclear cause I backed this report not only because I think the decommissioning of these plants is of benefit to all, but also because I hope that no more will be able to be built."
"Today we are faced with a ticking time-bomb across Europe."
"The operation of nuclear power plants for civilian purposes is founded on engineering practices which are now outdated and anachronistic."
"It can be said that their safety is ever more theoretical: everything will be fine, as long as nothing happens."
"In fact, we are dealing with protocols from 50 years ago which, in reality, are not protected against events that may be increasingly unforeseeable."
"Terrorist attacks could not have been foreseen and nor could the natural and disastrous events - not only earthquakes - which unfortunately are increasingly frequent in our disaster-stricken world."
"(HU) Mr President, I supported the report, which directly affects my country, Slovakia, as well."
"In 2004, the Lithuanian, Slovak and Bulgarian Governments made commitments in their accession treaties to gradually shut down some of their nuclear reactors."
"The closure incurred extraordinary economic burdens, thus the EU undertook to provide financial aid for decommissioning by the end of 2013."
"EU experience of nuclear decommissioning is limited."
"The shutdown may have a direct effect on the energy supply of the country concerned and neighbouring Member States."
"The development of alternative, low carbon emission and competitive energy sources must be promoted in order to manage the negative consequences."
"At the same time, we need to provide adequate financial resources to ensure that decommissioning operations occur in accordance with safety regulations."
"The European Union will be able to use the experience gained during the shutdown processes with nuclear power plants that are approaching the end of their economic lives."
"Based on the results, with a view to 2013, it may be presumed that several investment projects will be almost complete, and new decommissioning and management structures will be already available to us. Thank you very much."
"(EL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the Marinescu report, precisely because in Southeastern and Eastern Europe there is a heavy legacy of extremely dangerous nuclear reactors, such as in Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia."
"However, over all these years, billions of euros of European taxpayers' money has been spent modernising them and prolonging their life."
"We are basically subsidising the nuclear lobby which fought for reconditioning."
"Fukushima has shown us yet again that these reactors should be shut down; however, no such financial provisions were included into the operating costs of reactors and this is a huge and scandalous subsidy for a dangerous, expensive and contaminating method of producing energy."
"Now, however, we can change the political will."
"Convert subsidies for reconditioning unsafe reactors into funding to close them."
"Freeze all new reactors being designed."
"Convert resources from Euratom financing and abundant ITER subsidies."
"Divert the resources earmarked to design and build new reactors to an economy based 100% on renewable energy sources by 2050."
"We are in a state of emergency and we must respond."
"(LT) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a report that is harsh, but in many places very true."
"I would like to emphasise and draw my colleagues' attention to the fact that, together with Slovakia and Bulgaria, Lithuania has fulfilled the obligations laid down in its accession agreement and has closed its old Soviet nuclear reactors within the deadline set."
"Most of the projects concerning the closure of Ignalina have been implemented or are being implemented."
"Obviously, there are some difficulties."
"When a new Lithuanian Government and Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant Board take office, it is hoped that it will be possible to bring proceedings against those individuals, who failed to organise work properly, and also to review the agreement on the construction of repositories for spent nuclear fuel, managing to obtain favourable conditions."
"I entirely agree that it is necessary to manage funds and use resources with complete transparency, thereby ensuring nuclear safety."
"However, as we are discussing new nuclear power plants, I would like to use the opportunity to draw my colleagues' attention to the European Union border, to Russia and Belarus, where there are plans to construct power stations with experimental reactors."
"We must focus our attention on this."
"(DA) Mr President, I actually did not realise that we would, in fact, have the opportunity to give an explanation of vote in connection with this resolution, but, as that is the case, I will do so very briefly."
"The Danish Liberal Party is essentially against the Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"However, once the decision has been taken to set up such a fund and once applications have been sent in where the countries concerned meet the requirements laid down in connection with the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, we obviously must also grant the funds applied for."
"We therefore voted in favour."
"Mr President, I voted against both the Matera reports on the mobilisation of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, for the Czech Republic and for Poland, not because I feel any ill will against those countries - far from it."
"I am just very mindful of my own constituents in the West Midlands, and indeed their contribution to the GBP 48 million that the United Kingdom pays to the European Union every single day."
"Let me tell you a few things about the West Midlands: we have the largest youth unemployment and our motor industry was decimated, partly due to the European Union funding jobs in Slovakia that took away essential jobs from the Ryton plant."
"In 2004 it was, of course, the United Kingdom that bore the brunt of the EU enlargement, because it was the only one not to put up any barriers."
"That cost more in public services."
"Another example of an expense that my constituents have is that we contribute towards child benefit for people in Eastern Europe."
"People come over to the United Kingdom, work in the United Kingdom and claim for children who are resident in Eastern European countries."
"What we would like to do, and what I would like to see, is that GBP 48 million a day being kept in the United Kingdom and spent on essential public services, and not handed over, when the EU's accounts have not been audited for 14 years."
"(GA) Mr President, I was pleased to support these proposals from Bairbre de Brún and wish every success to the workers in the Czech Republic and Poland."
"However, I suspect that they will end up disgusted and dispirited, as I saw in my own constituency, especially in Dell in Limerick and Waterford Crystal in Waterford."
"The EAGGF is a wonderful concept but, unfortunately, it is too inflexible."
"As a result of this, much of the funding returns to the European Union."
"I would suggest that, where there is funding left over, the Member State concerned should be able to make proposals to the Commission on how best to utilise it on behalf of the workers."
"(GA) If that is done, it will greatly help unemployed workers and greatly improve the image of the European Union."
"(DA) Mr President, violence against women is a problem that exists the world over, and it is obviously important to adopt a position on this issue - both personally and from a political standpoint."
"Clearly, therefore, we must also adopt a position on this issue at European level."
"When discussing these problems, instead of creating a Christmas tree adorned with various initiatives, I would simply have liked the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality to have concentrated a little bit more on the initiatives that it actually wants the European Union to focus on."
"Other things being equal, I believe that would lend more weight to our actions and make them more effective and thus be better for the women concerned and, in that respect, also for the credibility of the initiatives that we propose here in Parliament."
"Mr President, violence against women is not a private issue."
"It is a crime to be persecuted."
"We need to break the silence."
"Respecting culture and religion is important but it should never be an excuse for honour killing, genital mutilation, trafficking, domestic violence and forced marriages."
"The Stockholm Programme provides a new policy framework to enhance the fight against violence on women and calls for concrete action."
"I encourage the Commission to come forward with a strategy which includes practical proposals."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe we must join forces across political parties to denounce and combat all forms of violence against women."
"I support the principle and most of the proposals, but judicial and criminal law measures should be taken at national level."
"That is what we are doing in Sweden."
"In fact combating violence is at the centre of the women's organisation of my party, providing practical action and raising awareness not only to protect women, but also to empower women and to develop a culture of respect for women's dignity."
"I have started a social media campaign on this which everybody is welcome to join."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as some of my fellow Members have already said, I think that by voting in favour of this report by Mrs Svensson we are making a commitment to ensuring that the Commission fulfils its pledge to adopt a Communication, before the end of 2011, for the implementation of a strategy and a European action plan to combat violence against women, which will take a global view and therefore include all the different cases, from sexual violence to domestic violence and female genital mutilation, and - I hope - all the new forms of violence."
"I am referring to the actual inducement to violence, which is often carried out by advertising and the media, as well as the forms of blackmail and violations of women's human rights that occur in the workplace when they decide they want to become mothers or are already working mothers."
"Following the implementation and adoption of the directive on trafficking in human beings - to which Parliament was very committed - and the directive on the European Protection Order, I think it would be important to have a proper directive on this issue within the new legal framework created by the Treaty of Lisbon and the Stockholm Programme."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, until all forms of violence against women have been completely eradicated we shall never be able to say that we have a modern society that is finally democratic."
"Once again Parliament is looking at this brutal phenomenon, which unfortunately remains shockingly topical."
"The figures are quite clear: at least one woman in five suffers physical or sexual violence during her lifetime and violence is actually the prime cause of death and disability among women aged between 15 and 44 - even more than cancer or road traffic accidents."
"Therefore, real and permanent mobilisation is needed, leading to the creation of a global legal mechanism to fight all forms of violence against women."
"A strong signal must be sent this day."
"There is only one final objective: this lethal virus must no longer find fertile ground."
"(ES) Mr President, violence against women is a direct consequence of discrimination; that is why we need a multi-faceted policy with special attention paid to the children of abused women."
"They must have the right to free legal aid and psychological support, women's refuges and economic assistance to enable them to be independent, to specialised courts, protocols for implementation and special training for health, police and legal workers, and for statistics to be compiled and data collected to give us a true picture of the problem and allow us to apply the most appropriate policies at European level."
"(NL) Mr President, I abstained from the final vote on the Svensson report and I am therefore using my explanation of vote to say that I, too, find violence against women to be shocking and totally unacceptable."
"However, I abstained from the final vote because I believe that this report is absolutely teeming with violations of the principle of subsidiarity, which I cherish, and I do not believe that creating new European bureaucracy, observatories or other bodies is desirable - quite the contrary is true."
"I am also disturbed, by the way, by the political correctness that results in the failure of the word 'Islam' to appear even once in this report even though that faith, with its plethora of backward standards and principles, obviously plays a major role in discrimination and violence against women."
"That is true in the Islamic world, of course, but sadly also over here."
"Let us call a spade a spade and Islam, in its real and current state, backward and misogynistic."
"- (SK) Mr President, I welcome the report of Mrs Svensson, because it advances the discussion on women's rights."
"In condemning violence against pregnant women, the report states, and I quote: 'the perpetrator thereby harms more than one person'."
"I have been striving for years for women's rights not to be placed in opposition to the rights of unborn children."
"The Svensson report has unfortunately not yet overcome this conflict."
"Restricting the reproductive rights of women, which is currently understood primarily to mean the right to abortion, continues to be regarded as a form of violence against women."
"However, if we finally count unborn children as human beings, then artificially induced abortion is an act of violence against the unborn child."
"In drafting a strategy for the fight against all forms of violence, the Commission should harmonise the rights of women and the rights of unborn children."
"The new strategy should protect women while also including mechanisms for protecting unborn children."
"This also emerges from the submitted report, but it has to be read carefully."
"Mr President, I voted against the Svensson report."
"Obviously I totally denounce violence, especially violence against women, so why did I then vote against this report?"
"I voted against it because, as a colleague of mine said a bit earlier, it is a bit of a time warp."
"It brings us back to the 1970s and political correctness and is very naive in that element."
"It just wants to replay the fights of the early 70s."
"I also am a bit concerned about the criminal nature it wants to bring in."
"This is what the European Union does, is it not?"
"It brings itself in on an issue that everyone can agree on - how awful violence against women is - and then sets things up and brings in criminal law."
"Then, before you know it, this is extended to more and more areas."
"Shame on the European Union for choosing such a subject, even if it is an own-initiative report, because this is where it starts."
"This is where the power grab starts and shame on it."
"What we need is real action on violence against women at Member State level."
"Leave things alone and stop using this subject."
"Written explanations of vote"
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was created in 2006 in order to provide additional assistance for workers affected by the consequences of significant changes in the structure of international trade and to assist in their reintegration into the labour market."
"Since 1 May 2009, the remit of the EGF has been expanded to include support for workers made redundant as a direct consequence of economic, financial and social crises."
"At this time when we are facing this severe crisis, one of the principal consequences of which is an increase in unemployment, the EU should use all the means at its disposal to react, particularly as regards support to be provided for those who are facing the day-to-day reality of unemployment."
"It is for this reason that I voted for this report relating to the mobilisation of the EGF in favour of the Czech Republic, with the objective of supporting workers made redundant in three enterprises operating in the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (NACE) Rev.n 2 Division 28, manufacture of machinery and equipment."
"in writing. - (PL) The global economic crisis has meant that the financial situation of many Polish companies has worsened."
"Problems associated with reduced levels of production have most impact on the ordinary people who work for these companies."
"In order to safeguard support for workers made redundant as a result of changes to the structure of global trade caused by globalisation, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was set up."
"Its main aim is to help such people to re-enter the labour market."
"The current application to mobilise the Fund for the benefit of workers from Polish companies in the Podkarpackie region is the first application this year."
"As a representative of Polish interests in the European Parliament, I approve of the Commission's decision to transfer money from the Fund to implement the objectives set out in the application."
"Thanks to this decision, the workers made redundant from three companies in the machinery sector in the Podkarpackie region are receiving nearly EUR 500 000 in financial support."
"By voting for the resolution, I would at the same time like to express my hope that the Commission will approve similar applications in the future."
"in writing. - (ES) The request complies with the requirements of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and relates to 200 of the 594 workers made redundant over a period of nine months in three Polish companies dealing in the manufacturing of machinery and equipment and which reduced their exports by 58%."
"Twenty per cent of those affected were over the age of 54, and 10% over the age of 64."
"This assistance will provide improvements to the training of those made redundant to equip them to occupy new jobs in the future."
"I am pleased with the work carried out on the basis of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), namely in supporting workers affected by changes in world trade."
"I also support the decision to mobilise the EGF in favour of Poland, for the benefit of workers in the manufacture of machinery and equipment sector made redundant as a result of the world economic and financial crisis."
"This is quite a timely measure, given the major slump in exports that has taken place in this sector, which has consequently been accompanied by an equally worrying rate of unemployment."
"in writing. - (PT) The request relates to 594 redundancies in three enterprises operating in the Podkarpackie region of Poland, in the manufacture of machinery and equipment sector."
"This is the first request to be examined under the 2011 budget."
"It is based on the intervention criterion of Article 2(b) of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) Regulation, which requires at least 500 redundancies over a nine-month period in enterprises operating in one region or two contiguous regions at NUTS II level."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs assessed the respective eligibility conditions favourably."
"The EGF was created in 2006 with the objective of providing additional support for workers who have been made redundant and are suffering from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns, and to assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"As a result of a revision of the EGF Regulation in 2009, the fund's scope was expanded to include support for workers made redundant as a direct consequence of the world economic and financial crisis."
"The annual budget available for the EGF is EUR 500 million."
"I believe that it would be advantageous to make the necessary efforts to speed up the mobilisation of this instrument, thus enabling aid to reach the workers who need it more quickly."
"This report is on a draft decision of the European Parliament and Council on the mobilisation of EUR 453 570 from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), to support the reintegration of Polish workers made redundant as a result of the current economic and financial crisis."
"This application, the first to be approved under the 2011 EU Budget, was submitted by Poland on 27 April and concerns 594 workers from the Podkarpackie region, who were working in the area of manufacture of machinery and equipment."
"Given that this involves a specific budgetary instrument, and that the amount requested is legally acceptable and complies with the provisions of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission, namely point 28, I am voting in favour of this proposal, and hope that it contributes to reducing the economic difficulties of this region's inhabitants, and to relaunching the local economy."
"in writing. - (PT) The agricultural situation and the problems facing the rural world cannot be dissociated from the system's profound crisis or from current policy, for example the common agriculture policy (CAP), which bears the majority of the responsibility for the continued decline of agriculture in some Member States: everything is oriented toward the interests of large-scale farmers and northern European agro-industry, destroying family agriculture and compromising the viability of small and medium-sized farms."
"The role of women in agriculture and the development of rural areas is extremely important, as they represent around 42% of agricultural workers, are a cornerstone of keeping farms going, and ensure that desertification in rural areas is effectively combated."
"Despite lacking any realistic critique of the CAP, the report adopted is generally positive in its approach and how it acknowledges the role of women."
"It says that the 'promotion of gender equality is a core objective of the EU and its Member States' along with the creation of better living conditions in rural areas, and the countering of the desertification phenomenon, for which the defence of 'good transport infrastructure' and the improvement of 'access to transport for all' with a view to combating 'social exclusion and inequality in society, primarily affecting women' is essential."
"This report enables the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for Podkarpackie Machinery in Poland."
"It should be remembered that Poland requested assistance for 594 workers made redundant in three companies in the manufacture of machinery and equipment division in the NUTS II region of Podkarpackie."
"The redundancies are linked to the impact of the economic and financial crisis, which has resulted in a drop in exports for the companies Huta Stalowa Wola SA, HSW - ZZN and DEZAMET SA of 47%, 34% and 58% respectively, meaning that the companies meet the eligibility criteria laid down in the EGF Regulation."
"The European Commission is therefore proposing the mobilisation of the sum of EUR 453 570."
"The result, they say, has been a considerable reduction in the production of machinery and equipment, thus demonstrating the effects of the crisis on the companies in question in the country."
"The 594 redundancies have severe repercussions for living conditions, jobs and the local economy, which is why mobilisation of the EGF is of the highest importance for supporting the affected workers."
"That is why we voted in favour, although we believe that the most important thing would be to prevent these companies going bust and the jobs being lost."
"in writing. - (LT) The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund has been created in order to provide additional assistance to workers suffering from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns."
"The application, case EGF/2010/013 PL/Podcarpackie machinery from Poland, was submitted by Poland to the Commission on 27 April 2010 and supplemented by additional information up to 4 August 2010."
"It was based on the intervention criterion of Article 2 (b) of the EGF Regulation, which requires at least 500 redundancies over a nine-month period in enterprises operating in the same NACE Revision 2 Division in one region or two contiguous regions at NUTS II level in a Member State and was submitted within the deadline of 10 weeks (Article 5 of the Regulation)."
"In its assessment the Commission indicates that the application fulfils the eligibility criteria set up by the EGF Regulation and recommends that the Budget Authority should approve this application, therefore I voted in favour of this document, which in my opinion will help avoid negative social consequences."
"I also believe that other EU Member States should take more advantage of the opportunities offered by the EU funds."
"I voted for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of Poland because I believe this instrument represents a valuable resource for the support of workers in difficulties on account of the economic crisis."
"As has been said a number of times, since 2006 the EGF has been providing practical support to European workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or, following the 2009 amendment, on account of the economic crisis, in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market."
"Today's vote was on a request for assistance concerning 594 redundancies (of which 200 are targeted for assistance) in three enterprises operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 28, in the NUTS II region of Podkarpackie."
"The total amount of funding provided by the EFG amounts to EUR 453 750."
"To conclude, I welcome the adoption of the report, which shows that the EGF is a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis."
"in writing. - (PL) The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was set up to provide additional support to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in global trade."
"Today the European Parliament voted on an application to approve the release of over EUR 450 000 for workers made redundant from three companies located in the Podkarpackie region."
"I would like to stress that EU support is a major boost for the region which I represent, since it will allow the workers who have been made redundant to re-enter the labour market, and funds will be earmarked for training, retraining, new equipment and help in becoming self-employed."
"The Podkarpackie region is one of the poorest in Poland, and so I am very pleased that it will receive EU assistance."
"I would like to thank everyone who voted in favour of providing financial support."
"I am pleased with the approval of the appropriation of EUR 453 000 from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for Polish workers made redundant in the machinery manufacturing sector."
"Following the recommendations of the Committee on Budgets, the European Commission has entered around EUR 50 million in payment appropriations to the budget line for the EGF in the 2011 budget."
"This allows us to approve an appropriation of the necessary funds without eroding the other budget lines dedicated to financing important actions among the Union's objectives and programmes."
"in writing. - I voted for this report giving support through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to 594 workers made redundant in Poland."
"The EUR 0.45 million will be used to retrain and support workers through a difficult transition."
"Once again we are condemned to vote for a pitiful handout by the EU to the victims of its relocation policies."
"The rationale behind the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is intolerable."
"I am abstaining merely out of consideration for the Polish workers whose pain may be eased a little by this hypocritical aid."
"The EU is an area of solidarity and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is part of that."
"This aid is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of company relocations that occur in a globalised context."
"More and more companies are relocating, taking advantage of low labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with damaging effects on countries that respect workers' rights."
"The EGF is intended to help workers who are victims of company relocations, and it is essential for facilitating access to new employment."
"The EGF has been used by other EU countries in the past, so now it is appropriate to grant this aid to Poland, which has applied for assistance with regard to 594 redundancies - 200 of whom are potential beneficiaries of aid - in three companies in division 28, manufacture of machinery and equipment, of NACE Rev. 2 in the NUTS II region of Podkarpackie in Poland."
"Although I voted in favour of this proposal to provide assistance to the workers of Podkarpackie machinery from Poland, I believe that this is an analgesic and palliative measure for the consequences of the capitalist model, and that it does not represent any progress in the fight against the root causes of the crisis."
"I agree with the mobilisation of resources from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for people made redundant due to structural changes in trade patterns or as a direct consequence of the current economic and financial crisis."
"I believe that the EGF can contribute to the ultimate goal of facilitating these workers' reintegration into the labour market."
"I also voted in favour because I am convinced that this assistance complements the redundancy aid provided for in all national legislation and collective agreements."
"Therefore, this mobilisation of funds from the EGF cannot under any circumstances replace or avoid the legal responsibilities of governments and companies to employees who have been made redundant."
"in writing. - Taking into account that Poland has requested assistance in respect of cases concerning 594 redundancies in the period from 1 June 2009 to 1 March 2010 (of which 200 have been targeted for assistance) in three enterprises engaged in the manufacture of machinery and equipment in the region of Podkarpackie in Poland, I totally approve and support such an active position by the Polish Government and the opinions of my S&D Group colleagues."
"Unfortunately, the government of my country - Latvia - does not respond to any requests and letters from my side and thus does not make use of aid from the Stabilisation Fund to overcome the financial crisis."
"in writing. - (DE) The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established to protect workers who have been made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis."
"Poland has applied for support for 594 redundancies in the Podkarpackie region."
"It is only right and proper that we should offer personal support to workers who have been made redundant as a result of globalisation and the economic crisis, aiding their reintegration into the labour market."
"I therefore voted in favour of this."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was created to provide additional support for workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns."
"On 15 February 2011, the Commission adopted a new draft decision on mobilising the EGF in favour of Poland, with the aim of supporting the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant as a result of the world economic and financial crisis."
"In this case it was the redundancy of 594 workers - 200 of whom are potential beneficiaries of aid - in three companies manufacturing machinery and equipment in the Podkarpackie region of Poland, during the nine-month reference period between 1 June 2009 and 1 March 2010."
"This is the first application to be examined under the 2011 budget, and it relates to the mobilisation of the total sum of EUR 453 570."
"The Commission's assessment concluded that there is a link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns or the financial and economic crisis, and that these redundancies were unforeseen in nature."
"The application meets all of the eligibility criteria set out in the EGF Regulation, which is why I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the fund."
"Poland's application for intervention by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) relates to 594 redundancies - 200 of whom are potential beneficiaries of aid - in three companies in Division 28 of NACE Rev. 2, manufacture of machinery and equipment, in the NUTS II region of Podkarpackie."
"According to the Commission's assessment, this application meets all of the legally defined eligibility criteria."
"Under Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and Council of 18 June 2009, which amended Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and Council of 20 December 2006 establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the EGF's scope was temporarily expanded to cover its intervention in situations like this, in which, as a direct result of the world economic and financial crisis, there are 'at least 500 redundancies over a period of nine months, particularly in small or medium-sized enterprises, in a NACE 2 division in one region or two contiguous regions at NUTS II level'."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, in the hope that the mobilisation of the EGF would contribute to the effective reintegration of these workers into the labour market."
"in writing. - We have requested that the institutions involved, as usually on those cases, make the necessary efforts to accelerate the mobilisation of the EGF."
"Moreover, Parliament appreciates in this sense the improved procedure put in place by the Commission, following Parliament's request for accelerating the release of grants, aimed at presenting to the budgetary authority the Commission's assessment on the eligibility of an EGF application together with the proposal to mobilise the Fund and hopes that further improvements in the procedure will be reached in the framework of the upcoming reviews of the Fund."
"However, it also recalls the institutions' commitment to ensuring a smooth and rapid procedure for the adoption of the decisions on the mobilisation of the EGF, providing one-off, time-limited individual support geared to helping workers who have been made redundant as a result of globalisation and the financial and economic crisis, points out the role that the EGF can play in the reintegration of workers made redundant into the labour market and, however, calls for an evaluation on the long-term integration of these workers into the labour market as a direct result of the EGF-funded measures."
"On 15 February 2011, the Commission adopted a draft decision on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of Poland, with the aim of supporting the reintegration to the labour market of workers made redundant due to the global financial and economic crisis."
"The request concerns 594 redundancies (of which 200 are targeted for assistance) in three enterprises operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 28 (manufacture of wearing apparel) in the NUTS II region of Podkarpackie, during the nine-month reference period from 1 June 2009 to 1 March 2010."
"My vote in favour of today's resolution reiterates the favourable opinion already given in the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs."
"in writing. - Whilst voting for this report, I consider it ironic that this fund exists when not all EU countries utilise it."
"The share of this fund remaining at year end is repatriated to Member States as part of their 'rebate'."
"Yet failure by some countries, like the UK, to use this fund, which is its established right, in cases like the Twining Tea plant closure in Andover, raises certain questions."
"Those pretending to understand the benefits/disbenefits of the rebate query whether or not it is more correct and efficient for countries to make direct use of EGAF monies at local level."
"The second irony concerns political and economic participation - engaging at all EU levels of added value."
"For the UK to maintain the right not to participate in funds managed at EU level because later benefits may flow is, in this case, uncertain and perhaps even plain wrong."
"The UK is renouncing access to funding on a principle of not applying for this fund in order to receive a rebate."
"For those seeking help to return to work - in Sandwich, Kent and Andover, Hampshire - there is little justification in saying 'no', and this is another UK Government let-down."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report which will provide funding for personalised measures to help workers who have been made redundant in Poland."
"I voted in favour of this important resolution on migration flows arising from instability: scope and role of EU foreign policy."
"Political, social and economic instability, lack of security, political repression and authoritarian regimes are the major driving forces behind migration, depriving affected communities of viable local prospects and income and, hence, of the right to choose whether to migrate or not, putting their lives at constant risk and leaving them with migration as their only option."
"The recent dramatic events in Egypt and other countries in North Africa and the Middle East have clearly increased the flow of both legal and illegal migrants to Europe."
"The European Union must therefore be ready to withstand the flow of migration."
"It can only do this by having an efficient and wise migration policy similar to those implemented in Canada, Australia or New Zealand."
"I agree with the rapporteur's position that we must urge the Commission to ensure that any readmission agreement signed by the EU and its Member States fully respects human rights and the principle of 'non-refoulement' and does not put at risk any persons in need of international protection."
"The EU will thus demonstrate once again that values and respect for human rights are the most important thing and inalienable, and persons seeking asylum will feel safe and respected."
"Political, social and economic instability, a lack of security and the political repression carried out by authoritarian regimes are the main factors behind migration and the migratory waves that spill over unceasingly into some countries in the Mediterranean basin, making them unable to manage the numerous difficulties caused by humanitarian emergencies."
"In recent weeks it has been impossible to ignore the thousands of migrants that have arrived in Lampedusa following the unrest in the countries of North Africa."
"Ninety per cent of them are young people of between 15 and 35 years of age, who are risking their lives in the hope of finding better opportunities."
"Despite the extraordinary efforts of the Italian Government, local administrations and the Italian Red Cross, the situation on the island is one of emergency: there is no sign that the arrivals will slow to a halt and one notes the delay of the EU, which has bureaucratic timescales that are incompatible with the situation."
"Today, the EU has the duty to develop an efficient global policy on migration that provides for the creation of a European asylum system, the implementation of an obligatory resettlement programme that is capable of sharing out responsibilities equitably, and agreements with the Member States to encourage development."
"The recent and ongoing events unfolding on the opposite shores of the Mediterranean bear witness to how the instability in this region and the consequent migration flows represent a challenge that the European Union must face up to."
"The migration phenomenon is worrying for the developments and tensions it may cause, both in terms of relations between migrants' countries of origin and destination, but also between their countries of origin and transit countries."
"We need to bolster the policy of prevention, optimising financial resources and improving existing institutional structures."
"We must keep illegal immigration under control and, in this sense, I think that extending migration agreements is an effective remedy to obtain short-term results and reduce the instability of migration flows."
"I agree with the analysis in the report and, in particular, I concur that a bilateral mechanism that enables active monitoring of the protection status of minorities - or other groups that could be subject to abuse or suffering as a result of instability - should be included when preparing the external action instruments for post-2013."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report."
"The recent events in Egypt and other countries in North Africa and the Middle East have increased the flow of both legal and illegal migrants to Europe."
"The European Union Member States are facing forced migration, which is a result of failing economies, impoverishment, human rights violations, environmental degradation, the widening gap between rich and poor countries, civil wars and political persecution."
"The management of migratory flows presents a huge challenge for the European Union, which must take action to establish a common immigration policy, capable of contributing to a reduction in illegal immigration."
"I agree that it is necessary to take preventative measures in all EU bilateral trade agreements, including human rights clauses, and the application of appropriate sanctions should be considered for countries that fail to comply with such clauses."
"in writing. - (PT) Europe is faced with an increase in migration flows resulting from the instability that many countries are experiencing, and this represents a challenge for the EU."
"These migration phenomena could be the cause of tensions between origin countries and destination countries, as well as between origin countries and transit countries."
"The EU's strategy should be to combine development cooperation measures with a more comprehensive political vision encompassing security, regional cooperation and bilateral agreements."
"This report identifies the following possible areas of action in this regard: encouraging transit countries and origin countries to achieve greater economic and institutional stability; stepping up the EU's own mediation and conflict-prevention efforts in cooperation with regional organisations; negotiating bilateral immigration agreements with transit countries; and developing an economic agenda which incorporates specific measures to raise employment levels in the EU's partner countries."
"The Commission should seek to strengthen synergies between the development pillar and the security and development pillar by creating new external action instruments for the post-2013 period."
"For all the above reasons, I voted for this report."
"I voted in favour of this text on migratory flows."
"Indeed, the events that our southern neighbours are currently going through are resulting in high levels of migration to European shores."
"Now more than ever, we have to coordinate our foreign and immigration policies."
"This is a truly European issue and now is not the time for national egoism."
"The Mediterranean countries of the European Union should not have to cope alone with the large influx of illegal migrants: this effort should be shared by all EU countries."
"I voted for this report because, by setting medium- and long-term goals, it takes a realistic approach to a problem originating in the imbalance between countries that are developed and those that are not, as well as in human rights violations in many parts of the world."
"The report suggests procedures to prevent illegal immigration, and aims to involve emerging countries in the comprehensive approach to this problem, along with all the countries involved: origin, transit and destination."
"Focusing on the idea of making cooperation policy conditional on the level of respect for human rights also seems particularly positive to me, as do the references made to protecting the most disadvantaged groups, such as women or unaccompanied minors."
"in writing. - (BG) I voted for this resolution because the migration flows being caused by instability in one country pose a challenge to the entire European Union."
"The resolution marks a first step towards creating a common European migration management policy."
"This policy must also act as a deterrent."
"In order to achieve this, it must combine every possible European Union cooperation instrument in the area of social and economic development, thereby having a direct influence on the causes of instability in the countries where the migration flows originate."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report."
"Migration is a particularly relevant issue which has been highlighted recently, because due to events in North Africa, the European Union, as a neighbouring region, has been forced to receive huge flows of migrants."
"The report draws attention to the many factors behind migratory flows, such as political and social factors, economic instability and climate change, which still fails to be taken into account when examining the reason for mass migration."
"Due to all these reasons, it is stressed that the EU requires a more effective approach to migration, which would complement foreign policy instruments."
"These instruments would help address sources of instability in countries of origin, which force people to emigrate en masse to more stable neighbouring countries."
"The report also calls on the Commission to draw up proposals on legal migration, which would be easier to manage and could promote economic and social progress in receiving, transit and origin countries."
"It is stated that the very worst human rights violations, as well as criminal activities, which often become a business for those organising those activities, are precisely linked to illegal immigration."
"Finally, it emphasises the need to assess the demographic situation in the EU itself, in order to calculate exactly how many people Europe can receive."
"The European Union must tackle migration flows caused by wars and armed conflicts, ethnic tension, human rights violations and natural disasters in third countries."
"The Union has to meet this challenge effectively by implementing preventive measures and employing the most appropriate foreign policy instruments with a view to addressing the causes of instability directly so that emigration becomes an opportunity rather than a desperate necessity."
"A European policy on regulating migration should combine development cooperation measures with a more comprehensive political vision encompassing bilateral security and regional cooperation agreements with countries of origin and transit countries, the protection of human rights and democratisation."
"European foreign policy should complement and generate synergies with immigration policy, focusing on the causes of instability and structural problems in the countries of origin."
"It must also seek to establish an ongoing dialogue with transit countries, with a view to regulating migration flows and applying uniformly international human rights standards relating to immigration."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Provera because I think it represents a step forward towards the goal of solidarity between Member States."
"In recent weeks in particular, Italy has been the destination for thousands of migrants fleeing the countries of North Africa."
"Faced with such a difficult situation the EU cannot abandon my country, but must make every effort to ensure that the treaties are respected, particularly Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"At the same time, we need to optimise financial resources and existing structures."
"For example, the role of the Frontex border agency needs to be strengthened and also better funded."
"Protecting human rights, increased financial resources, the development of democracies, the rule of law and bilateral agreements are instruments which, if used correctly, can certainly contribute to preventing mass migration."
"in writing. - (CS) I agree there is a need to come up with an integrated long-term EU strategy for unstable states that would address the basic causes of migration flows."
"However, I do not share the belief that the Council should submit an action plan on sharing the burden, based on the principle of solidarity set out in Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."
"The resettling of refugees from this region should be the responsibility of the states which the refugees head to, and if the influx becomes unsustainable, the response should be to tighten up EU asylum and immigration policy."
"In this context, I consider the calls to create a common EU asylum system and a common EU resettlement programme to be alarming."
"The creation of a comprehensive Commission approach to legal migration is a good idea, but it should not be linked to the needs of the European labour market or the capacity of each Member State to receive and integrate migrants."
"The management of migration flows should remain primarily within the remit of Member States."
"I welcome EU efforts to respond to the challenges created by instability and migration flows, which affect not only origin countries but also transit countries, in various areas relating to violence, human rights violations, and so on."
"I therefore support an active policy in this area, which seeks to resolve the initial destabilising factors in origin countries, such as lack of economic and democratic structures."
"This is the only way to eliminate the negative consequences of migration, which should be positive and productive, and not a means of escape."
"This policy should translate into cooperation between origin countries and transit countries, based on dialogue aimed at achieving robust, effective and lasting results."
"I voted against the report on migration flows because, although it contains a relatively accurate and balanced analysis of the basic causes that drive people into leaving their country, the report does not contain the necessary conclusions or proposals."
"On the one hand, it persists in the approach of dividing people into legal and illegal immigrants and in the utilitarian perception of 'useful' and non-useful immigrants, thus linking their rights to the various 'quotas' applied by the Union and the Member States."
"On the other hand, the report links the phenomenon of immigration to security issues, thereby creating confusion and equating immigrants with various criminal or 'terrorist' activities and strengthening the practices and ideologies that criminalise them."
"Within this context, the report reinforces the 'paternalistic' role of the Union still further, to the point that it proposes linking the pillar relating to EU development aid to third countries with the 'security' pillar, thus completely altering the nature and purpose of such aid."
"With the previous conferences having focused on principles, I hope that the fourth UN Conference in Istanbul will be geared towards determining results and devising clear indicators for halving the number of less developed countries by 2020."
"Out of the 51 underdeveloped countries, where 78% of the population live on less than USD 1.25 a day, only three have moved out of this category in recent years."
"The situation is worrying as these countries are the most vulnerable to ordeals such as the financial and food crises and climate change, while also facing extreme poverty, a lack of infrastructure and rising unemployment."
"This reality highlights that, unfortunately, the international community has not fulfilled the commitments set out in the Brussels Action Programme."
"I hope that during the Conference, where I will be representing the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, we will focus on achieving consistency in terms of development policies and methods for implementing innovative funding mechanisms, with the aim of providing more effective help to these countries which need to be encouraged to implement suitable policies."
"This is quite an important issue, and its complex nature needs to be taken into account when it is analysed."
"The report in question looks at the importance of continuing with cooperation treaties relating to the European neighbourhood policy (ENP)."
"The phenomenon of emigration fuelled by situations of crisis and instability has negative implications for the origin country, the destination country and the displaced populations themselves."
"This phenomenon needs to be reversed, so that emigration under these circumstances ceases to be the last resort: an escape from a situation of insecurity, of weak economic development, of instability or of fear."
"In this explanation of vote, I reiterate the need to take measures ensuring and promoting stability and security in origin countries."
"The perspective for reducing these migration flows fuelled by instability and crisis should be prevention."
"I believe that European foreign policy, and very specifically the ENP, should provide for aid to these regions of the world, promoting security, stability and the protection of human rights as part of an expanded development process, as I stated in my report on the revision of the ENP-South, which will also be voted on this week."
"Some Member States are having to deal with a mass influx of people from the south of the Mediterranean who are looking for protection."
"They cannot cope alone with these emergency humanitarian and immigration situations."
"Frontex's human, material and also financial resources must be increased to enable it to provide greater support to operations such as Hermes and Poseidon."
"The MEPs are calling on the European Council to draw up an action plan for the resettlement of the refugees, applying the clause of solidarity between Member States."
"Indeed, Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union mentions the principle of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility between all Member States with regard to border control management, asylum and immigration policies."
"In the medium and long terms, we must forge cooperative links with future migrants' countries of origin and establish mobility partnerships to enable their nationals to come and work, study and travel legally between the two shores of the Mediterranean."
"I voted in favour of the report on migration flows arising from instability: scope and role of EU foreign policy."
"Political, social and economic instability, lack of security, political repression and climate change push communities into migration, so the EU needs to develop a common immigration policy, to include, specifically, promotion of economic and social progress in receiving, transit and origin countries, and enhancing social cohesion by improving the integration of migrants."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats agree that migration flows as a result of instability constitute a challenge for the EU and that increased efforts are required to deal with the causes of the instability and structural problems in the countries of origin."
"However, we believe that it is important for the EU to take genuine responsibility for the migrants who come here and not leave the responsibility to our neighbouring countries, as proposed in paragraph 9."
"We support the call for the human rights dimension to be clearly reflected in the work of FRONTEX, especially the right of a person to leave his or her country, the ban on refoulement and the right to seek asylum."
"We see problems with some of the work that FRONTEX has done to date and do not support the wording that states that the European Parliament welcomes the successful activities carried out by FRONTEX."
"in writing. - (PT) The relationship between centres of instability - social, economic or political - and migration flows toward the European Union is clear."
"The Union's foreign policy cannot simply be not removed from this phenomenon: it must seek to understand it, and monitor it to the greatest extent possible."
"In truth, the EU needs to take measures to optimise the use of its financial resources and institutional structures, and effectively manage migration flows resulting from the instability that currently exists in several areas of the world."
"A policy of prevention that uses the most appropriate foreign policy instruments, with a view to tackling and confronting the causes of instability, could help to transform the current 'desperate necessity' for emigration into an 'opportunity' for emigration."
"The rule of law needs to be promoted, human rights protected, and the development of democracy and economies fostered."
"Without these common development efforts in the countries involved, working alongside their people and social structures, it will not be possible to contribute effectively to instability reduction."
"This report focuses on the migration flows resulting from the political instability being experienced in certain regions of the world, in particular North Africa and the southern Mediterranean."
"This situation, which is affecting the countries of southern Europe, particularly Italy - we are all following the situation on the island of Lampedusa, where more than 20 000 people have landed - and the island of Malta, has brought more than 400 000 refugees to Europe."
"In order to minimise this situation, in addition to mobilising the European Refugee Fund, it is essential that the EU implement a more sustained plan aimed at humanitarian assistance and guaranteeing the basic needs of these people as soon as possible."
"A regional programme aimed at refugees from Egypt, Tunisia and Libya also needs to be drawn up, relating to both asylum and the protection of refugees, in order to prevent human trafficking and to prepare their return to their countries of origin."
"I welcome the adoption of this report, as it indicates that the EU is going to address the structural causes of problems resulting from migration flows through its foreign cooperation policy, without preconceptions of any kind."
"There are reasons for migration flows."
"The most important of these are factors such as wars and armed conflicts, systematic human rights violations, and ethnic and religious conflicts and repression."
"However, natural disasters and poverty resulting from the lack of adequate economic and democratic structures are also among the most frequent causes of migration flows."
"The effects of the crisis of world capitalism and the consequences of its irregular and asymmetrical development are exacerbating the economic and social situation in many countries."
"The uprisings in the Arab world are also an expression of this phenomenon, which also tends to increase migration flows."
"The European Union's discourse on this subject is frequently hypocritical, and it operates a policy of double standards."
"On the one hand, it claims to defend human rights in third countries, whilst maintaining a self-serving view of them when it comes to attacking any of these countries."
"On the other hand, it is complicit in the continuation of serious situations, such as the one occurring on Lampedusa, Italy."
"Prevention of these migration flows requires measures based on a genuine policy of development cooperation and aid, of solidarity and of peace promotion, including peaceful conflict-resolution, which is currently not the case."
"We know that wars and armed conflicts, ethnic tensions, systematic human rights violations like refusal to allow people to practise their religion, natural disasters, and poverty resulting from the lack of adequate economic and democratic structures are the main causes of migration flows."
"The current outlook is that the situation is going to get worse, with the crisis that capitalism is suffering and its social consequences, including the uprisings in Arab countries."
"As a result, the European Union cannot continue with its hypocritical policy of double standards, claiming to defend human rights in third countries while allowing serious situations like the one in Lampedusa to continue."
"There needs to be a policy of prevention, and development cooperation measures, with a more comprehensive political vision, that includes, above all, solidarity and the safeguarding of human rights, which is currently not the case."
"In general, the European Commission and the European Parliament itself prioritise their economic and geostrategic interests, and forget solidarity and the Millennium Development Goals, adopting shameful directives such as the Return Directive."
"This is why we voted against this report, despite the fact that it includes one or two positive points."
"I would like to offer my support to the inhabitants of Lampedusa, who are faced with overcrowding, insecurity, supply problems and possibly health hazards, but who, in the eyes of this Parliament, take second place to the tens of thousands of illegal immigrants landing on their shores."
"I also wish to say to the Italian authorities that it is to Africa, not Europe, that the boats they charter should repatriate these illegal immigrants."
"Most of these people come from Tunisia, a country where apparently a wonderful democratic adventure is taking place, in which they have a duty to take part."
"We cannot continue to accommodate all those who feel uneasy in their own country, because it is raining there... or not; because it is a dictatorship... or because it is no longer one; because it is underdeveloped, or because it is developing."
"The main motivation of these migrants is purely economic."
"Our development aid policies should encourage people to remain in their own country, and should even be conditional on that and on their citizens returning."
"Contrary to what the rapporteur says, there is no such thing as the 'right' to emigrate."
"The European peoples on the other hand, who should be your first priority, do have the absolute right to say 'STOP' and to be heard."
"I voted for this parliamentary report on 'Migration flows arising from instability: scope and role of EU foreign policy' and I want to focus on a number of aspects contained in this report."
"Nearly 24 000 Tunisians have arrived on the island of Lampedusa and on Italy's shores since the fall of President Ben Ali, and thousands of Libyans have also fled their war-torn country since February."
"We absolutely need a European response and European solidarity in the face of this unfolding human drama."
"Our report calls for a system of solidarity regarding the resettlement of refugees from North Africa."
"Our report calls for the 'solidarity clause' to be applied between Member States with regard to policies on border controls, asylum and immigration."
"Our report also asks for the post-2013 budget to include a provision on emergency funds for a rapid response to immigration and asylum in Europe."
"All these aspects are necessary in a genuine European asylum policy, which we have long been calling for and which must be based on the principles of coherence, responsibility, solidarity and respect for human rights."
"I voted in favour of this own-initiative report because it highlights the real causes of migration flows, namely political, social and economic instability, lack of security, political repression, violation of human rights, as well as climate change."
"This report also emphasises the importance of providing countries of origin with sustainable strategies within the framework of the European neighbourhood policy (ENP) and the EU development cooperation policy."
"In so doing, it challenges the myth of zero immigration by reminding us that migration cannot be stopped and that the EU needs substantial, but controlled, immigration to support the ageing population and address other social and economic challenges."
"in writing. - The Provera report deals with a number of important issues relating to migration and highlights the importance of human rights."
"Human rights have been at the heart of campaigns in Scotland and the UK to end the detention of children seeking asylum."
"The UK Government has vowed to end this obscenity - but to date they have fallen short."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this document, because migration flows arising from instability are a challenge for the European Union."
"Wars and armed conflicts, ethnic tension, systematic violations of human rights - such as the refusal to allow people to practise their religious faith - natural disasters and the lack of proper economic and democratic structures are the main causes of this type of migration flow."
"This phenomenon is particularly worrying because it may give rise to or exacerbate tensions, not only between countries of origin and countries of destination, but also between countries of origin and transit countries."
"In order to meet this challenge effectively, the European Union must implement a policy of prevention, employing the most appropriate foreign policy instruments with a view to addressing the causes of instability directly, so that emigration becomes an opportunity, not a desperate necessity."
"There is an urgent need, therefore, to initiate a debate with a view to gaining a better understanding of all aspects of migration and their root causes."
"This would enable the EU to draw up a coherent and effective policy on migration flows from countries of origin and transit countries and to decide how and how much to invest in those countries with a view to alleviating their internal demographic and social tensions and thus fostering stability."
"The draft resolution voted on today by this House poses an important question: how to define the role of EU foreign policy when faced by the simultaneously tragic and delicate issue of migration flows?"
"The challenge that the European Union must face up to is caused by the obvious instabilities in which North Africa and the Middle East are enmeshed."
"In order to avoid negative consequences, Europe must be able to meet this challenge by setting out and implementing a policy of prevention that acts on the causes of economic and political instability in these countries, proposing shared solutions that can prevent or at least reduce the magnitude of the phenomenon."
"However, the resources required for this purpose are extensive, which is why it will be necessary to involve other world powers and coordinate with them."
"All of which cannot, however, be done without fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity."
"From this point of view, Europe is duty-bound to respond concisely and cohesively, thereby demonstrating its decision to focus on this policy above others."
"For these reasons, because I am convinced of the important political signal that Europe is morally obliged to send on this issue and not leave the States to their own devices, I used my vote to support the aforementioned resolution."
"Since the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force, the EU has had very wide powers in terms of controlling migration flows."
"These powers are now being called upon to manage the recent influx of refugees fleeing from the troubles in North Africa, especially Libya."
"The 'Arab spring' is a potent symbol of freedom, but it also masks a more tragic reality which is causing large numbers of civilians to take to the road (or to the sea in this instance) in search of asylum."
"This resolution therefore calls upon EU and international institutions to take stock of the consequences entailed by these vast population movements."
"I supported it because individual Member States cannot cope with this situation alone: cooperation and sharing must guide the way we handle it."
"The Union's new foreign policy architecture introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, and more specifically the creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS), should also allow the action of the Member States to be coordinated more effectively."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, which welcomes the Commission's recent proposals on legal migration for non-asylum seekers, and urges it to develop further instruments to establish a common immigration policy, to manage economic migration with a view to promoting economic and social progress in receiving, transit and origin countries, and to enhance social cohesion by improving the integration of migrants."
"It emphasises the need for adequate information to be provided on possibilities for legal immigration to the EU, in order to prevent illegal migration, make better use of the EU schemes for legal immigration, clarify current prospects and opportunities within the EU and give the lie to the false promises made by traffickers, thereby limiting the profits generated for organised crime and human traffickers by the need for people to move."
"It calls on the Commission to foster protection measures for vulnerable groups and people (mainly women and children) who often become victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation, and urges it to build up information centres on possibilities for migration to the EU in third countries."
"It calls, however, for a balanced approach between promoting legal migration into the EU and ensuring that the EU has the capacity to receive and successfully integrate migrants;"
"This report fails to disguise the truth, despite its outpouring of fine feelings."
"The EU is concerned about the fall of dictators it used to support in exchange for management of 'migration flows' at its borders."
"The idea of a mass influx of refugees, victims of these dictatorial systems, did not worry it, and for good reason."
"It is the arrival of democracy that worries it."
"Yet Europe will need 230 million immigrants between now and 2030: the European Commission has said so itself."
"Moreover, this text recommends applying sanctions to countries that fail to respect the principles enshrined in the free trade agreements and those advocated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
"The Arab revolutions have barely shaken off the yoke of their own despots and now foreign tyrants are sending them their regards."
"This report is arrogant and brutal."
"I am voting against it."
"Migration flows resulting from instability are a challenge for the European Union."
"Wars and armed conflicts, ethnic tension, systematic human rights violations like refusal to allow people to practice their religious faith, natural disasters and the lack of proper economic and democratic structures are the main causes of this type of migration flow."
"This phenomenon is particularly worrying because it may give rise to or exacerbate tensions, not only between origin countries and destination countries, but also between origin countries and transit countries."
"In order to meet this challenge effectively, the European Union must implement a policy of prevention, employing the most appropriate foreign policy instruments with a view to addressing the causes of instability directly, so that emigration becomes an opportunity, not a desperate necessity."
"I voted against the Provera report on migration flows arising from instability: scope and role of EU foreign policy, because I reject the European Union's migration policy; the policy of 'Fortress Europe', with borders that are iron-clad for men and women but which, by contrast, evaporate when it comes to capital."
"This report advocates European migration policy that is not based on the understanding that emigration is a right and not a crime, and does not guarantee the sacred principle of requesting asylum."
"The EU's hypocrisy is abominable: it is criminalising undocumented immigrants."
"Illegal immigrants are used for labour in the process of rapidly accumulating capital, in a direct assault on the universal nature of human rights."
"The EU, which can only exist through economic immigration, is demonstrating great cynicism."
"What is happening in North Africa is proof of 'Fortress Europe'."
"The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX) has nothing to do with solidarity or cooperation to help peoples fight against dictatorships like those of Ben Ali, Mubarak or Gaddafi: when thousands of Africans are fleeing repression and war, the EU imprisons them."
"in writing. - Migration flows arising as a result of instability constitute a challenge for the EU."
"Wars and military conflicts, ethnic tensions, systematic violation of human rights - such as a prohibition to exercise one's religion, natural disasters, lack of economic and democratic structure are among the causes of such migration flows."
"This phenomenon is of great concern since it may not only increase and strengthen tensions between the country of origin and country of destination but also between the country of origin and a country of transition."
"In order to address the challenge efficiently, the EU should conduct preventive policy by any appropriate means of foreign policy intended to deal with causes of instability so that emigration becomes an opportunity not a necessity."
"In the long term, the EU may undertake effective actions for optimisation of the use of its own financial instruments and existing institutional structures."
"The measures proposed in the report are not sufficient and are too declarative."
"A precise and specific financial economic plan is necessary."
"Otherwise, Europe will choke as a result of the wave of illegal migration."
"As a first step on the way to resolving this problem, the report is very useful."
"in writing. - (DE) In view of the continuing stream of migrants into Europe it would seem all the more important to take a stance against the legalisation of economic migrants."
"It is vital that developing countries should receive our support so that these people are encouraged to remain in their own countries."
"It makes no sense to allow people from developing countries to enter the labour market, particularly because the unemployment rate in the euro area currently stands at 9.9%."
"Mr Provera's original report was very good and well-balanced."
"However various amendments have unfortunately changed it in the wrong way."
"It is for this reason that I have cast a 'no' vote."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution, because following the unrest in the Arab countries when migration flows greatly intensified, it is important for a common migration policy to function across the entire EU."
"Given the fact that migration cannot be stopped, foreign policy must play a special role in this area."
"Countries on the EU's external borders are worst affected by increased migration flows."
"Every effort must therefore be made to ensure that a common EU migration policy is established at EU level so that migration flows are managed and controlled optimally."
"Only joint efforts will protect economic growth, labour market sustainability and scope for development from negative consequences in those countries facing the greatest flows of immigrants."
"This will be an effective instrument for stopping illegal immigration, organised crime and trafficking in human beings."
"The EU must make every effort to ensure that legal migration is promoted and that we combat irregular migration effectively."
"It is very important to establish a system for legal migration, taking account of the needs of Europe's labour market and the capacity of each Member State to receive and integrate immigrants."
"Legal immigrants in European Union Member States must enjoy the same rights and obligations as other workers."
"Furthermore, in every country it is very important to reduce the brain drain and the departure of qualified specialists."
"To that end we must introduce assisted return programmes, promote circular migration, regulate recruitment practices and support capacity-building."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Provera on one of the founding principles of the Union: solidarity among peoples."
"Given the political crises in North Africa and the slow or totally absent response of the European policy on migration flows, the current situation is so serious and problematic that I think it ought to be dealt with without delay."
"Through the adoption of this text, the Council has been invited - an invitation that cannot and must not be ignored - to fully implement the solidarity clause with a practical action plan and sharing of the burden among Member States."
"In particular, the text makes the case for minimum standards for giving temporary protection to immigrants and measures designed to share responsibilities and efforts between Member States which, like Italy, take in immigrants responsibly and shoulder the consequences alone."
"It is important that, at European level, we are linking the increased pressure from migration flows to EU foreign policy."
"European initiatives may help the politically unstable countries in North Africa from which large numbers of illegal immigrants originate."
"Full use can and must be made of tools such as development and cooperation aid programmes and readmission agreements."
"Clearly, these issues will be crucial in the immediate future, both for Greece and for the rest of the EU, which is why I voted in favour of this particular report."
"Migration flows resulting from instability are currently a major challenge for the EU."
"They result from wars, armed conflicts, ethnic tensions, human rights violations like refusal to allow people to practice their religion, natural disasters and a lack of adequate economic and democratic structures."
"This is a growing phenomenon that causes tensions, not only between origin countries and destination countries, but also between origin countries and transit countries."
"This report establishes a set of recommendations aimed at enabling the EU to respond effectively to this challenge."
"Among other measures, I would stress the adoption of a policy of prevention, aimed at tackling the causes of instability directly, so that emigration becomes an opportunity rather than a desperate need, and of development cooperation with a more comprehensive political vision that includes security, regional cooperation, and bilateral agreements with origin countries and transit countries."
"These objectives should be pursued alongside the Millennium Development Goals, which are closely linked to political stability, and should frame the entire process."
"Migration flows arising from instability are the indirect consequence of violations of human rights, environmental disasters and the lack of economic and social structures capable of assuring the wellbeing of broad sections of society."
"These things represent a challenge for the European Union, due to the efforts they require both in terms of cooperation for development and in terms of prevention of social tensions, which are often not only created between countries of origin and destination but also between countries of origin and the migrants' transit countries."
"This challenge requires practical responses from the EU that are designed to tackle not only cooperation for development but also foreign policy, implementing preventive measures at both regional and global level, measures which make use of all the foreign policy instruments available, and are focused on security, regional cooperation, bilateral agreements with countries of origin and transit, and protection of human rights and democratisation."
"Given my strong conviction that it is important for the EU to act directly on the causes of instability, partly by improving the use of the available instruments, I have no option but to vote in favour of the proposal."
"in writing. - Migration flows arising from instability are a challenge for the European Union."
"Wars and armed conflicts, ethnic tension, systematic violations of human rights - such as the refusal to allow people to practise their religious faith - natural disasters and the lack of proper economic and democratic structures are the main causes of this type of migration flow."
"This phenomenon is particularly worrying because it may give rise to or exacerbate tensions, not only between countries of origin and countries of destination, but also between countries of origin and transit countries."
"In order to meet this challenge effectively, the European Union must implement a policy of prevention, employing the most appropriate foreign policy instruments with a view to addressing the causes of instability directly, so that emigration becomes an opportunity, not a desperate necessity."
"A European policy on regulating migration should combine development cooperation measures with a more comprehensive political vision encompassing security, regional cooperation, bilateral agreements with countries of origin and transit countries, the safeguarding of human rights and democratisation."
"The management of migration flows arising from political instability represents a fundamental challenge for the European Union."
"Wars and armed conflicts, ethnic tension, systematic violations of human rights, natural disasters and the lack of proper economic and democratic structures are the main causes of these flows."
"I believe it is now necessary to implement a policy of prevention, bringing to bear the most appropriate instruments in order to act on the causes of instability."
"European foreign policy should focus on the roots of instability and on structural problems in the countries of origin."
"I think this text represents another instrument for the EU to use as it outlines a coherent and effective policy on the phenomenon of migration flows, directing its choices on the most appropriate path towards recreating conditions of political, economic and social stability."
"I am strongly opposed to the report in question."
"The motto 'united in diversity' allows for everyone to be master in his own backyard and the European Union cannot and must not force us to accept unwelcome guests."
"Denying ourselves the right to return illegal migrants to their countries of origin goes against every rule of good sense."
"If legality is not respected, we risk an invasion of millions of desperate people in flight."
"People who suffer need to be helped, but in their own countries, by preventing the trafficking of human beings."
"I strongly reject accusations of European racism and xenophobia, because I am tired of watching illegal Tunisian migrants going on strike because they are not being given money to buy cigarettes, refusing to eat food containing tuna because it smells of fish, and, once in Italy, demanding housing and work (for free, of course), when we have our own indigenous unemployed and poor people."
"Compliments to the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, are surely wasted since in reality she has had no idea how to handle the current crisis in the Maghreb."
"The icing on the cake, meanwhile, is having to consider lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and transgender people as persecuted or having few rights and therefore worthy of particular attention."
"I voted in favour of Mr Provera's report, because I consider that his report takes a realistic attitude to the problem and his proposed burden-sharing of immigration is sorely needed."
"Immigration is a difficult issue to resolve; however, we can manage it, if we take the right action."
"The problem cannot be shouldered basically by Greece, Italy and Spain."
"Since January, 23 000 immigrants have entered Italy."
"We must try, especially in light of developments in North Africa and the Arab world, to find a European strategy to address the problem of immigration, so as not to leave the Member States to their fate and, at the same time, to ensure that the unfortunate people forced to migrate and the citizens of Europe bearing the burden are not taken advantage of."
"in writing. - (NL) This resolution has the merit of cranking up the debate about the Union's migration policy, although the text could have been more specific and more strongly worded."
"Right now, just as the situation in North Africa is giving rise to large flows of migrants, the EU is failing to hit the mark by failing to take any clear responsibility."
"Frontex cannot be the only instrument involved in tackling the refugee crisis."
"Europe also urgently needs to develop an action plan for burden-sharing in order to assist the resettlement of refugees from the region and to offer support to the homeless."
"I find it regrettable that, in the current circumstances, the postponement of an agreement governing cooperation between the EU and Libya was apparently the only possible option."
"In such agreements, it is not the tightening-up of border controls into the Union that should be the primary concern but monitoring the ratification of and compliance with the Geneva Convention."
"I hope that this resolution is a first step towards a more global approach to the issue of refugees so that people are dealt with in a more humane way."
"I voted for Mr Provera's report on 'Migration flows arising from instability: scope and role of EU foreign policy'."
"Coordination between foreign policy and immigration policy is essential."
"We need to focus on the deep-rooted causes of instability in certain regions of the world and to manage migration flows effectively."
"Migration management policy should indeed be effectively combined with European development cooperation policy, and should take into account aspects concerning security, regional cooperation in the Southern countries and cooperation agreements with countries of origin and of transit."
"With regard to the central role of some third countries in this policy, I am convinced that it is absolutely essential for the EU to sign cooperation agreements to be signed between with these countries in order to combat illegal immigration."
"In this respect, the cooperation agreement between Libya and the European Union, which for the time being is suspended, must be restored."
"The recession and political instability prevailing in several countries have helped to boost migration flows and this poses a challenge for the EU."
"The measures proposed in this particular report will help to address this problem, which terrifies the countries on the EU borders directly and the whole of the EU indirectly."
"One of these measures is the development of a permanent monitoring system for Frontex activities and operations linked to the management of migration flows, which must be permanent and stable."
"That is why I voted in favour of Mr Provera's report."
"I welcome the adoption of this balanced resolution which proposes routes for responding to the challenges of migratory pressures which Europe is facing."
"I believe it is essential for the EU's migration policy and its development aid policy to feed into each other."
"There are unseen human dramas behind the migration phenomena, and part of the solution lies in aid policy for third countries that will contribute to their development and stability."
"It is an issue that the European neighbourhood policy (ENP) also needs to take into consideration."
"I believe there is an urgent need for a Union-wide response and I call on Member States and the Commission to mobilise the necessary tools and resources."
"This will be done by strengthening the resources and role of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (FRONTEX)."
"It will also be done by providing adequate assistance to the regions and towns of the Mediterranean coast that will have to deal with the humanitarian emergency that this influx of immigrants is going to create, and that will have to ensure that order is maintained and to encourage the integration of legal migrants."
"To my mind, European solidarity must fully come into play between Member States and third countries."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of this report."
"As the report highlights, the current stream of migrants is causing huge tensions between the countries of origin, the recipient countries and the transit countries, as well as within the recipient countries themselves."
"As a preventive measure, Mr Provera proposes getting to the root cause of migration and addressing the lack of democratic and economic stability in the recipient countries in European foreign policy."
"The European Parliament has produced various reports in the area of development policy that called on the Commission and Baroness Ashton in particular, to include the human rights situation in all its negotiations and only to provide support and facilitate trade in this context."
"I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate this demand."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution on the role of women in agriculture and rural areas, because women in today's society assume multifunctional roles in the context of their individual family and occupational ties, and this very multiplicity of roles enables them to contribute significantly to progress and innovation at all levels of society and to the improvement of quality of life, especially in rural areas."
"Unfortunately, there is a decrease in the number of women in rural areas."
"Therefore, in order to ensure a stable situation for populations working in agriculture, rural development policy should focus more strongly on creating innovative and sustainable living and working conditions in rural areas."
"I agree with the rapporteur's opinion that we should encourage women's entrepreneurial spirit and initiatives, in particular through the promotion of female ownership, networks of female entrepreneurs, and provision in the financial sector for facilitating access for rural businesswomen to investment and credit - thus empowering them more effectively in the marketplace and enabling them to develop businesses from which they can make a stable living."
"It is also important for support to be given to political efforts to further the role of women in agriculture by making it easier for them to be active as agricultural entrepreneurs."
"There must be improved access to land and credit for women to encourage the establishment of women in rural areas and as actors in the agricultural sector."
"I am delighted to give my backing to the report by Mrs Jeggle since it focuses attention on the 42% of women who live in rural areas and do an essential job in developing, stabilising and modernising them by coming up with new forms of entrepreneurship."
"Thanks to their hard work, these women have shown that they can contribute to the evolution of traditional ways of life and production in the countryside, building businesses that can provide jobs and which allow family commitments to be reconciled with work."
"The objective of guaranteeing equivalent living conditions in all regions and avoiding the unilateral development of urban centres means the rural space needs to be equipped with the most up-to-date IT infrastructure, with adequate access to broadband, and developing electronic forms of enterprise, such as e-business, which allow people to do business regardless of their distance from urban centres."
"In addition, we must also improve women's education and provide easier access to credit in order to support female entrepreneurship."
"The social protection policies to be embarked upon must also bear in mind the living conditions of migrant women employed as seasonal workers in agricultural businesses, particularly with regard to the need to guarantee these women suitable accommodation, medical insurance and adequate sanitary facilities."
"Respect for the principle of gender equality is a basic requirement under the Europe 2020 Strategy and should be promoted in order to increase the number of women involved in economic and social activities and the equality of rights for women and men in the agricultural sector in particular."
"I feel it is important to emphasise the role played by women in farms and rural areas."
"This is why support policies must reflect more than they have until now women's important role, needs and situation in the countryside."
"I encourage Member States to devise incentives in the countryside for promoting women as producers or entrepreneurs and for supporting their involvement in the political process, including as representatives on the management board in institutions, with the aim of supporting equal roles for women and men."
"I voted for this report which helps combat social exclusion in rural areas."
"The key aim of rural development policies is to ensure equal rights for men and women and equivalent living conditions in all regions, thereby avoiding unilateral development of highly populated urban areas so as to prevent a mass exodus from the villages."
"Since women make up 42% of those involved in the agricultural sector, it is clear that they play an important role in rural areas and farm business."
"There must be recognition and support for women and for the contribution they make to agriculture and rural life and, to this end, I support this important report."
"There must be due recognition given in EU agricultural policies in future to the role of women."
"I support what the report says on the excellent work of women's networks in energising rural communities and promoting equality and social inclusion in the countryside."
"They must get more political support at local, national and European level."
"In Ireland, for example, the ICA is an important and influential organisation in rural areas which celebrated 100 years of existence recently, it has approximately 11 000 members and has been supporting rural women for a long time now."
"Proper support must be given to those local organisations and they must be taken into account in EU agricultural policies in the future."
"in writing. - (PT) Women are playing an increasingly important role in the agricultural sector and rural areas."
"Over the last few years, the support provided to women for their own projects has enabled them to make significant progress, which has resulted in increased development for rural society as a whole."
"Women have been contributing to advancing traditional economic models and lifestyles in rural areas, whilst also contributing to the stabilisation and modernisation of the business models involved, and, as a result, to the sustainable development of rural areas."
"In rural areas too, women expect to be able to realise their own plans for their lives, to be economically independent and to meet family challenges."
"As such, this report, for which I voted, advocates taking greater account of the wide range of vocational skills, interests and achievements of women, so that jobs in farming remain an attractive option for them."
"Ensuring that men and women can succeed and have good life prospects in rural areas should be the main objective of European rural policy."
"The situation of women in rural areas is a very real and topical issue for the European Union."
"However, it is a very serious and urgent matter for some new Member States, such as Romania, where there is a very high proportion of rural areas with an extremely low employment rate."
"We need to adopt a suitable approach, one which will receive financial support in the future CAP, so that we can achieve results in creating living conditions which are attractive to women and men in these areas."
"I agree with the idea expressed by Mrs Jeggle about a European rural women's network supported also through the measures under the second pillar of the CAP."
"I also agree with the notion that one of the priorities of the reform of the CAP should be for women in rural areas to have access to services and aid, according to the needs of each Member State."
"The report under discussion today is particularly important since it focuses on the main points to be worked on in order to obtain an effective contribution from women in the development of rural areas, while at the same time aiming to improve employment prospects in the context of the new common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"In my opinion, the role of women in agricultural businesses and rural environments represents a significant aspect of territorial development policies."
"Indeed, one of the main objectives of European policy on rural areas is to guarantee equivalent living conditions in all regions so that, even in the countryside, men and women have the chance to grasp opportunities to build something."
"During the current CAP development phase, bearing in mind the needs of women who live in rural areas takes on fundamental importance, as does unleashing their potential."
"I believe that in terms of a forward-looking worldview, it will be necessary to make greater efforts for the sustainable use of rural areas, which must be efficient both in terms of energy and quality."
"Furthermore, greater commitment will be needed from all those involved in the agricultural reform process."
"in writing. - (BG) The aim of the common agricultural policy is to promote the high-quality, sustainable development of rural areas."
"I voted in favour of the text because I think that women play an extremely important role in modern society."
"During recent years, it has become clear that a large proportion of the projects carried out in agricultural areas would have been inconceivable without the active involvement of women."
"I also think that living conditions need to be improved in rural areas."
"This can be done by increasing access to the infrastructure, facilities and services for everyday life."
"Women must be given the opportunity to achieve a work-life balance and village communities need to be preserved."
"Women must have access to support services, facilities and structures."
"Their role also needs to be strengthened in the decision-making process."
"in writing. - (IT) Considering that the risk of social exclusion in rural areas is greater for women than for men, and considering the significance of this, I strongly support this resolution, which draws attention to the role of women in agriculture and demands not only that women's agricultural and non-agricultural professional competencies be given more prominence in business and regional development strategies, but also encourages incentives for the promotion of women's involvement in the market by eliminating all types of discrimination, improving available training and access to post-graduate and specialist courses."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report, because I believe that regional development is becoming a particularly relevant issue today, as rural areas are becoming more and more sparsely populated, due to social change and changes in social structures, values and a growing tendency towards individualisation."
"I entirely agree that one of the important measures that may change this emerging tendency towards urbanisation is the creation of suitable living and working conditions in rural areas."
"Experience shows that quality of life and economic power in rural areas are closely linked to women and the role they play in farming."
"Consequently, it is particularly important for the measures proposed in the report, which would enable women to realise their own plans for their lives, to be economically independent and meet family challenges just as successfully as they do today in urban areas."
"Measures listed in the report include the continuation and development of training and counselling provision for women that has a specific rural focus, continuity of EU support for agriculture and business in rural areas, the development of the most essential infrastructure and IT infrastructure, and the opportunity to take advantage of early retirement and many other measures."
"in writing. - (IT) I should like to congratulate my colleague and rapporteur Mrs Jeggle for the work she has accomplished, which has allowed Parliament to publicly acknowledge the multifunctional role played by women in the agricultural sector."
"Despite the fact that 42% of around 27 million workers in the sector are women and almost 29% of agricultural businesses are managed by a woman, the role of women has yet to be properly recognised."
"I voted in favour of this document because I agree on the need to recognise the unique role played by women in agriculture."
"Furthermore, I believe we have an obligation to identify the specific needs of women in rural areas and to ensure that future strategies, beginning with the next reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), adequately meet those requirements."
"The European Union must not overlook the professional, familial and social aspirations of women who live in rural areas."
"To allow this to happen, it is therefore appropriate for European institutions to guarantee the necessary support services and an innovative package that is not exclusively geared to the market."
"Finally, I share the proposals made by the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, especially as regards the need for greater female representation in political, economic and social organisations in the agricultural world."
"in writing. - (PT) I welcome the importance accorded by the Commission to the role of women in the development of rural areas."
"The multifunctional role of women in recent years, in both economic and social terms, is a reality to which we should not be indifferent."
"This applies especially to agriculture, a sector to which women have contributed significantly in recent years, not least as regards business diversification and adjustment to the market."
"Thus, and in line with common agricultural policy objectives of encouraging more-sustainable use of rural areas, action needs to be taken with a view to satisfying the needs and aspirations of women in these areas."
"In doing this, particular care needs to be taken to maintain and develop the necessary support infrastructure, with the importance accorded to education being particularly significant."
"in writing. - Moves by the European Parliament today to support and strengthen the contribution of women to Europe's vital agriculture sector are welcome."
"The 'Women in Agriculture' report was backed by a significant majority of MEPs and is a timely measure."
"Not many people realise that 42 % of those working regularly in the agricultural sector are women."
"I welcome this report."
"in writing. - (RO) Bearing in mind that the principle of gender equality is promoted by European legislation and is one of the fundamental requirements of the Europe 2020 Strategy, I consider it appropriate to include this issue in the future common agricultural policy, including through the use of new instruments which will promote this principle."
"I believe that the future common agricultural policy must be a fair policy, including for women."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of this report, as it argues that promoting gender equality is a core objective of the EU, and considers that this principle should be incorporated into the common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"It is essential to facilitate women's access to farming and agricultural credit."
"This report also contributes to the promotion of sustainable economic growth and rural development."
"in writing. - (SV) We voted in favour of the report on the role of women in agriculture and rural areas, as we believe that it is essential to combat the lack of equality in society."
"The report also illustrates the importance of there being a well-functioning infrastructure and the basic provision of certain services, for example broadband and childcare, not just in towns, but in rural areas, too."
"However, we would like to emphasise that we do not believe that agriculture should retain the same proportion of the budget in the next multiannual financial framework, but rather that agriculture's total share should be significantly reduced."
"in writing. - (PT) If we advocate serious commitment to the agricultural sector - as I do - and the possibility of the working in the rural world being a real lifestyle choice for families, it is vital to ensure that anyone making this choice has access to similar conditions as those living in the cities, in terms of health, education and family support infrastructure."
"Development and social cohesion involve harmony between rural and urban areas, without the former being forgotten about or systematically considered less attractive."
"Such a paradigm shift can, naturally, involve women's active role in agricultural communities."
"I do not have a romantic and bucolic vision of the 'escape to the country': quite the contrary, I know that such a lifestyle choice has costs, and often means leaving behind easy access to the infrastructure essential for modern life."
"This is why I view the concerns set out in this report favourably, as they allow a commitment to promoting quality infrastructure for supporting families, education, health and transport in the rural world too."
"in writing. - (PT) The promotion of equality between the sexes is a core objective of the EU and its Member States."
"This principle should be included in the common agricultural policy (CAP) in order to promote sustainable economic growth and rural development: farms, rural tourism, direct marketing and social services are the cornerstones of a rural supply structure, and should be supported sustainably through the CAP."
"The CAP should be used to promote these services, in order to provide women with new prospects and opportunities for paid work, and also to facilitate the reconciliation of family life with working life to a significant extent."
"There is a need to take action against population aging in rural areas, and to this end conditions need to be created for the settlement of people, as the importance of vibrant and dynamic rural areas with a diversified population should be stressed."
"In this context, I would stress the importance of development opportunities and adequate challenges for young women."
"There is a need to support and revitalise the rural world as a diversified and extensive area in which to live and do business, making use, above all, of the specialist knowledge and skills of women."
"in writing. - (PT) This resolution is opposed to adopting the draft regulation proposed by the Commission on 'on the authorisation and refusal of authorisation of certain health claims made on foods and referring to children's development and health', as it is not compatible with the objectives and content of the Regulation on nutrition and health claims made on foods."
"Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is found in breast milk, where it contributes to normal visual development in children aged up to 12 months."
"In a context of a lack of clear scientific consensus on the effect of DHA-enriched formulas on infants, in a biological environment other than breast milk, whether formula milk or other foods for infants, we believe that a preventive and precautionary stance should be adopted."
"We are concerned about the adoption of the draft regulation in question, as it does not meet the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, which states, inter alia, that 'a claim should be scientifically substantiated by taking into account the totality of the available scientific data'."
"in writing. - (PT) All policies of the European Union and the Member States should take promoting equality and women's rights into account, along with combating sex-based discrimination."
"There is therefore a need to accord particular importance to the situation of women in agriculture and rural areas, whose lives are suffering from the profound crisis into which current policies, such as the common agricultural policy (CAP) and others, have plunged the rural world."
"Women, who represent around 42% of the 26.7 million people working in agriculture, are particularly affected by hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized farms going out of business, and by the process of destruction of family farming, which have resulted from successive CAP reforms."
"As in other areas of activity, they are also victims of unemployment, insecure jobs, low wages and poverty, which have been aggravated by the antisocial policies imposed under the pretext of the crisis."
"Instead of empty words, we need, therefore, to break with the policies that created the current situation."
"Value needs to be ascribed to the role of women, their rights, equality, and public services in rural areas relating to health, education, cultural and leisure provision, social infrastructure..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. - (DE) This report deserves whole-hearted support because it draws attention to the special role of women in agricultural business and in rural areas, while at the same time offering solutions for current challenges."
"These solutions will help make the working life and day-to-day situation for women in rural areas more attractive."
"One strand of this solution is supporting affordable, easy access to support services and facilities such as kindergartens, out-patient clinics, and so on, as well as the requisite infrastructure."
"There is also a proposal to use EU funding to improve the quality of life in rural communities."
"Another essential element is greater access to schools, higher level vocational and academic training, and an improvement of social conditions for women in rural areas."
"This will not only benefit women in rural areas, but also enrich these areas, sustainably developing them as an integrated place in which to work and live."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document, because it is very important to highlight the role that women play in farm businesses and in rural areas, taking particular account of its multifunctional nature."
"It remains a crucial task for European rural policy to achieve equivalent living conditions in all regions, preventing the one-sided development of heavily populated urban areas, so that, even in rural areas, women and men can look forward to staying and having a successful life."
"If we want to keep women of all generations living in the countryside or encourage them to move there, then support policies must reflect their needs and circumstances more strongly than has been the case in the past."
"In a modern society, the only way to do this is through recourse to support services, facilities and structures that must be affordable and accessible at regional level."
"One of the core European support strategies must be to maintain this supportive structure and develop it in a woman-friendly way."
"It is necessary right at the planning stage - for example, when constructing a kindergarten, creating a day-care facility or developing public transport - to identify new approaches and to involve women of all generations in the decision making."
"Schooling, vocational and academic education and further training remain fundamental to quality of life and quality of work in rural areas."
"in writing. - (FI) The lives of women in rural areas have changed and become more diverse over the last 50 years or so."
"Traditional jobs in these areas have declined in number."
"At the same time, new lifestyles have come along to take their place."
"They show marked differences as regards women's background, education and status in the labour market."
"These changes also need to be reflected more in the Union's support policy, for improved reconciliation of rural women's working and family life."
"In recent years, women have used their education and professional skills to promote the development of the traditional rural economy."
"Innovative rural businesses of all kinds, which focus, for example, on services and farm tourism, have significantly revived the rural economic structure."
"There must also be support for the establishment and development of innovative rural businesses in the future."
"Finally, I would like to point out that the promotion of gender equality is one of the main objectives of the EU and the Member States."
"The Union's common agricultural policy should therefore incorporate the principle of promoting equality."
"in writing. - (DE) This report represents a move by the European Parliament to improve living and working conditions for women in rural areas and to create opportunities for their development."
"At the centre of report's proposals is the further expansion of rural infrastructure to offer women new prospects and employment opportunities."
"The issue of work/family compatibility is something that also affects those in the agricultural business."
"Like the rapporteur, I am convinced that a campaign of active support for rural areas is the only way to prevent women from moving to the cities."
"This also requires needs-based childcare facilities and an infrastructure tailored to families in the agricultural sector, as well as access to the Internet and other communication technology."
"In order to be able to implement important measures in rural areas in the future, we will require sufficient financial means for agriculture and for the development of rural areas."
"I support the call in the report, emphasising the importance of not cutting the agricultural share of the EU budget as part of the forthcoming talks on the future EU financial framework."
"in writing. - (IT) I strongly supported the report produced by my colleague Mrs Jeggle because I found it to contain important principles to be noted and upheld in the future."
"Out of a total of around 27 million people regularly employed in agriculture in the EU, around 42% are women whilst, according to official statistics, one agricultural business in five (around 29%) is directly managed by a woman."
"I invite you to take these figures into consideration when assessing the huge contribution women in many local communities make to development, which often follows a disproportionately low participation in decision-making processes."
"This is a barrier that we must overcome with a policy of services that, via the new common agricultural policy (CAP), will facilitate the processes of development and activity in the rural fabric of many areas."
"I am thinking in particular of training, consulting and business creation initiatives, which in the framework of the second pillar of the CAP, could still be developed and which would represent the turning point for a significant improvement in living conditions for women, as well as men, in rural areas."
"I consider this to be a fairly strategic requirement, not least when it comes to achieving the EU 2020 Strategy objectives, with particular reference to initiatives aimed at stimulating innovation, research and development."
"in writing. - (PL) Today in Strasbourg we voted on the report on the role of women in agriculture and rural areas."
"I personally come from a rural area, I live in a rural area and there was a time when I worked hard on my parents' farm."
"I can state with full conviction that women in rural areas influence not only the development and modernisation of farms, but frequently also the stimulation of the entire rural community, thanks to their hard work and determination."
"Their activities in rural homemakers' clubs, their efforts to preserve traditions and family customs, and also their successful implementation of new solutions in the area of farm management mean that they are a group which should be supported and promoted and whose value should be stressed."
"I would like to thank all women in rural areas, both in Poland and throughout the European Union, for their hard work and their contribution to regional development, and I would like to make it known that I voted in favour of the Jeggle report. Thank you."
"in writing. - I welcome this report's recognition of the important role women play in agricultural production and the need to adapt certain policies and conditions to assist them."
"However, I do not believe this should be used as a justification to throw even more money at the CAP."
"in writing. - (IT) I have voted in favour because I strongly believe that we need to recognise the central role played by women in places where their work is fundamental to the performance or recovery of that particular local economy, which in itself contributes to the general growth of our countries."
"The role of women in the agricultural sector has changed significantly in recent decades, becoming an ever more multifunctional position."
"For this reason, the European institutions should take steps aimed at avoiding an exodus of women from the countryside, or in any case at encouraging the return of women to rural life."
"Support for women and their plans would lead to progress in the development of rural communities as a whole."
"We need to offer women who work in the agricultural sector the chance to achieve their individual life plans, making them economically independent, and able to meet familial responsibilities."
"Jobs in agriculture must remain attractive to women so that they are able to carry out their multiple professional competencies."
"In this period of financial and economic crisis, it is fundamental that we create equivalent working conditions in the countryside and in cities, so as to repopulate territories which could provide a kick-start for economic recovery in a given European region."
"The radical changes in European rural areas all represent challenges in terms of population, jobs, services and the environment."
"We must emphasise the significant impact of the presence and involvement of women on quality of life and the rural economy."
"Women will represent great potential for the EU when it undertakes to develop and build on Europe's rural economy."
"EU funding can therefore help to improve the quality of life and work in rural areas by boosting incomes and through schooling and vocational and academic education and further training."
"The future of the agricultural sector depends on its ability to diversify."
"The potential of the services provided by farm businesses in addition to their own food output depends on the creativity of the people involved, the women among them having already contributed a great deal."
"There are many opportunities for the creation of local services, and to involve women in these is the best way to guarantee the success of such projects."
"in writing. - (PT) Given women's increasing importance in agriculture and rural areas, the new common agricultural policy (CAP) needs to take this into consideration in order to promote equality between genders."
"That is the only way that we will succeed in promoting sustainable economic growth and rural development."
"As in urban areas, we need to create good living conditions in rural areas, so that women and their families have incentives to remain there."
"I voted for the report on the role of women in agriculture and rural areas because I believe that their role is crucial in this sector that employs 14.6 million people, or 41% of women."
"Although I am aware that the second pillar of the common agricultural policy provides support for projects relating to women's living conditions in rural areas, I believe it necessary to analyse the projects underway in order to identify sound practices and contribute to improving the situation of women, which is especially affected by the consequences of the current structural crisis of the capitalist system in rural areas."
"This is especially true when we take into account the high levels of female unemployment, to which we must add the fact that many women do not even take part in the labour market, meaning that they are not registered as unemployed and do not feature in unemployment statistics."
"I also believe that social protection for women workers in the agricultural sector is indispensable to the development of rural areas, so I voted for this report, which is a step in that direction."
"in writing. - As was said, the report aims to highlight the need to implement the principle of gender equality in the common agricultural policy as a way of promoting sustainable economic growth and rural development."
"Therefore the EU needs to refocus its EU support strategies in order to develop the rural areas in a women-friendly way."
"Promotion of the entrepreneurial attitude and skills of women in agriculture, improving access and specific training for women, equipment of rural areas with the most up-to-date IT infrastructure, greater recognition and more support for women's networks, fostering the quality and accessibility of infrastructure facilities and service, adequate social security benefits for women working in agriculture, shared ownership of farms, specific attention for female immigrants are among the most important points which the different political groups agreed on."
"Well, who would vote against it?"
"How unspecified and populist it is!"
"It seems that the rapporteur showed her kindness to women working in agriculture."
"Nothing specific is said about children and healthcare."
"Lack of efficient healthcare!"
"The lack of efficient healthcare and pre-school education in rural areas is precisely what concerns women from Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania."
"I voted 'for'; however, the report is raw and unprofessional."
"in writing. - (DE) The role of women is still a subordinate one in the agricultural sector."
"According to this report, we need to cater more closely to the needs of women, particularly in non-urban areas."
"Opportunities should be made available for further education and training, as well as better access to childcare."
"Women farmers are contributing more and more to the diversification and adaptation of businesses, leading to a significant rise in multifunctionalism in the agricultural sector."
"In order to be able to maintain the attractiveness of farming as a source of employment and a lifestyle, women should be given the chance to influence decisions in committees and associations."
"Likewise, it is essential the position of women in agriculture should be made more secure in order to offer them an incentive to stay in the sector."
"I have voted in favour of this report, as we must stop the decline in farming by every means available to us."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for the Jeggle report, which I welcome, being an MEP elected in Romania, a country which has a large number of people involved in agricultural activities."
"However, I would like to point out that, in my view, the report ought to have been firmer on the issue of living conditions in the countryside."
"We need a heavily financed European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to be able to narrow the disparities between rural and urban areas."
"Investment in modernising the basic physical infrastructure must remain an essential aspect of this fund."
"Furthermore, additional references would have been helpful to the ageing of the rural population and the importance of the programmes aimed at the early retirement of farmers and setting up young farmers."
"in writing. - (DE) In many ways, women are the backbone of our agricultural sector."
"The role of women is becoming increasingly important the more we try to establish the right conditions for a sustainable, ecologically responsible agricultural industry based on small holdings."
"That is why it is important for society to give greater recognition and respect to the work of women in the agricultural sector."
"In addition, more must be done in future to cater to the specific needs of women in the agricultural sector in order to attract the younger generations to the industry."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - (PL) A motion for a resolution by the European Parliament on the role of women in agriculture and rural areas was adopted today."
"Our experience in recent decades has proven that the growing involvement of women and their knowledge, experience and professionalism is a key factor in the development of all branches of the economy."
"For this and other reasons, I believe that one of the fundamental objectives of the common agricultural policy should be to make rural areas more attractive, paying particular attention to the needs and role of women."
"We should make every effort to help women to achieve their goals, and also to combine a career with family life."
"In order to achieve this, we need guaranteed access in rural areas to services in the broad sense of the word and to infrastructure, and also training and personal development opportunities."
"It is essential to take measures to support entrepreneurialism among women and to combat all manifestations of gender-based discrimination."
"We should also focus on ensuring greater political and financial support, for example by means of easier access to investment and loans."
"I am sure that all these measures will ensure that women's potential for the development of agriculture, and of local communities and entire regions, is put to ever better use."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution, aimed at increasing the role of women in the agricultural sector and improving their situation in rural areas, providing more social guarantees and promoting employment and entrepreneurship."
"Above all, we must make every effort to ensure the establishment of an effectively functioning social protection system, which would make it possible to take early retirement and receive maternity pay."
"In order to create a favourable environment to promote entrepreneurship, all rural areas must have the most up-to-date IT infrastructure."
"Adequate broadband access is one of the main factors behind the growth in the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas."
"Furthermore, we must make every effort to ensure that rural communities are preserved and opportunities are created to reconcile family and working life."
"Consequently, there is a need to ensure that people living in rural areas receive a high standard of health care, education, child care and other services intended to meet daily needs and which would create more favourable living conditions and would reduce social exclusion."
"Member States using money from the Structural Funds must establish and implement initiatives which would promote the participation of women in the labour market, reduce social inequality and address issues related to transport infrastructure."
"Greater attention must also be paid to farmers' organisations, and a European rural women's network should be created so that development programmes in rural areas are fully implemented."
"in writing. - (IT) The new common agricultural policy (CAP) also takes into account social issues such as the role of women in rural areas."
"The common aim is to avoid a situation in which development occurs exclusively in population centres, thereby avoiding discrimination on the grounds of sex and or geographical provenance of citizens who live in the countryside."
"Since I agreed with these principles, I voted in favour of the report, which underlines the important role played by women in agricultural businesses and in rural environments, and draws attention to the significance of this role for territorial development policies."
"The report highlights areas where work is needed to see women better integrated and to make best use of their professional potential, leading to better prospects in life by way of greater ecological and energy efficiency in rural areas."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of this report as I agree with the majority of the proposals it puts forward, specifically the promotion of multifunctionality in rural areas, which are areas for living and doing business where communities should stay and be made dynamic."
"It is important to recognise that rural areas are particularly affected by population ageing, low population density and, in some areas, depopulation, for which reason the common agricultural policy (CAP) should be oriented toward responding to these challenges."
"It is a fact that, historically, women's work in agriculture has been systematically undervalued, and frequently unpaid or paid at a lower rate than equivalent work carried out by men."
"It is therefore important that this be taken into consideration as part of this topic, and that, above all, equal working conditions be established for equal work."
"In any case, I believe that the key thing is for this issue to eventually lose its relevance, by establishing gender equality in agricultural activity."
"in writing. - (IT) Women are the backbone of the agricultural sector in rural areas."
"It is thus important that we focus on the role they play in agricultural businesses and in rural areas."
"To that aim, we must take into account their needs and make use of their potential, since issues such as quality of life and economic capability are linked, particularly in rural areas, to the presence of women and their work on many fronts."
"Thus, European support policies must do more than ever before to meet their needs and conditions, so as to prevent an exodus of women of all generations from the countryside or, in any case, to encourage them to return to rural life."
"In light of this, aid from the EU can contribute to improving quality of life in rural areas, for women who manage a business or supply services as well as for consumers of goods and services."
"Since women play a vital role in terms of sustainable development in rural areas, I am voting in favour so as to guarantee concrete support for women in this sector."
"in writing. - Women are very important for the agricultural sector and the rural world and their presence there is increasingly obvious."
"It is therefore important to highlight the role that women play in farm businesses and in rural areas, taking particular account of its multifunctional nature."
"If we want to keep women of all generations living in the countryside or encourage them to move there, then support policies must reflect their needs and circumstances more strongly than has been the case in the past."
"In rural areas, as elsewhere, women expect to be able to realise their own plans for their lives, to be economically independent and to meet family challenges."
"The European Commission should increase the budgetary allocations for the ESF in order to provide adequate resources for measures to improve education and training for improving labour market access and combating unemployment and measures and activities under the Social Inclusion Strategy and the EU 2020 flagship initiative on combating poverty and social exclusion in favour of disadvantaged and vulnerable persons, especially women, including those confronted with precarious and insecure contracts."
"The Member States should contribute in particular to a definite improvement of the social situation of women in agriculture in Europe."
"What if women farmers were the future of the common agricultural policy?"
"While slightly controversial, that statement is largely well founded when we consider the importance of women in rural life and on farms."
"According to statistics, women farmers in the European Union account for 43% of farm labourers and 20% of farm managers, and this does not include the spouses of male farmers whose work is often not taken into account."
"At a time when farms are becoming specialised, the creative nature of women is an unquestionable advantage which, combined with their greater concern for environmental sustainability and quality, deserves to be recognised and supported at European level."
"That was the choice made today by the European Parliament which, in adopting Mrs Jeggle's report, has highlighted the important role that women will play in the future enhancement of rural areas."
"As the rapporteur very appropriately wrote in her explanatory statement: 'Experience shows that, in rural areas most particularly, quality of life and economic strength are linked to the presence of women and their involvement in a wide range of activities.'"
"Here we have a simple and modern way of re-thinking the agricultural profession."
"in writing. - Women are the backbone of the agricultural sector and the rural world and their presence there is increasingly obvious."
"It is therefore important to highlight the role that women play in farm businesses and in rural areas, taking particular account of the multifunctional nature of these businesses."
"In this context, there are opportunities to provide practical support measures for women in agriculture."
"Greater account must be taken of the wide range of vocational skills, interests and achievements of women, so that jobs in farming remain an attractive option for them."
"This will entail women having a full share in the resources that underpin farming as a way of life and a type of business."
"Women farmers must have a share in rights and duties that is commensurate with their co-responsibility for the farm business, including through the representation of interests on agricultural bodies and by having a real share in farm income."
"Ensuring adequate social cover for all women who work in agriculture is another indispensable factor in modern sustainable farming."
"Experience with systems of agricultural social security in the EU Member States should be taken into account and should, in the medium term, contribute to a definite improvement of the social situation of women in agriculture in Europe."
"in writing. - (IT) Sustainable development in rural areas has always been considered a priority in Europe, in order that we may guarantee the best possible living conditions for men and women who choose to work in this sector."
"Currently, 26.7 million people are employed in the agricultural sector in the European Union."
"Forty-two per cent of these are women, and at least one agricultural business in five is managed by a woman."
"An image of rural female reality emerges from these figures that is radically different from that of previous decades, in which women were the protagonists of change and came from very diverse social and economic backgrounds across the Member States."
"I support the text of this report since it draws attention to the need to plan European support strategies for rural areas that are tailored specifically for women, in order to work towards improving women's social and working conditions in the medium term."
"in writing. - (IT) We have no option but to vote in favour of the report on the role of women in agriculture and in rural areas because we still believe in the professional farmer who lives from the income derived from his own business."
"Typically engaged in maternity and their usual role of supporting other family members, women are undoubtedly disadvantaged in an agricultural context."
"The routines of agriculture are not determined by fixed hours but have to adjust to seasonal requirements, vegetative periods and the possible presence of livestock."
"There are periods when working days will be 12 to 13 hours long, seven days a week, and others that are quieter."
"It is obvious that a woman farmer, during pregnancy for example, cannot give up working on the land if she needs to, because to do so would deprive her of income for the whole year."
"The needs of women farmers are thus different to those of other female workers, and so it is vital that they are guaranteed adequate and specialised support, taking into account the fact that agricultural businesses are almost always located far from public services, such as public transport, assistance or social support."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, because I consider that women play a huge role and make a huge contribution to rural and agricultural development."
"Support for women and their business plans in the rural sector will help the entire rural community to progress considerably."
"In the midst of an economic crisis and with galloping unemployment, we must provide incentives to keep women of all ages in the countryside, to support female entrepreneurship and to invest in their training, in order to achieve development and innovation in the agricultural sector."
"I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Jeggle for this excellent report, which highlights the extremely important role played by women in agriculture."
"I am aware that many of us would like women of every age to remain in the countryside, or we believe that we need to encourage them to move there to ensure the future of rural areas and agriculture in Europe."
"However, in order to facilitate this, we have to improve women's access to education and training in the agricultural sector and allow them to gain better access to direct payments."
"On the other hand, we must ensure they have access to decent pensions and social insurance."
"In Romania, for example, some women living in the countryside are not eligible for farmer pensions and find it very difficult to start a business in the agricultural sector."
"This is why it is paramount that we focus more attention on women working on family or subsistence farms and guarantee them both a decent living and adequate pensions."
"in writing. - (PL) I endorsed the report on the role of women in agriculture and rural areas."
"In particular, I am in favour of solutions aimed at increasing levels of employment among women in rural areas."
"In Poland there are more women who are unemployed than men, particularly in rural areas."
"A large percentage of those without work in rural areas are women under the age of 34."
"In the majority of cases these are educated women, who cannot find work appropriate to their qualifications."
"This is a particularly dangerous trend, since it is young people who should be given greater opportunities to gain a foothold in the labour market."
"In the long term, this results in the feminisation of unemployment in rural areas, and thus in higher levels of poverty among young women."
"Many of them decide to move to towns to look for work, which in turn leads to an ageing of the rural population, a drop in the natural growth rate and a general deterioration of living conditions for residents of rural areas."
"In connection with this, I support the proposal whereby provision should be made in the new EAFRD regulation for special funding aimed at supporting women in the future 2014-2020 programming period."
"This may have a positive effect on levels of employment among women in rural areas."
"I am also in favour of ensuring appropriate benefits for women living in rural areas, within the framework of social security systems."
"These benefits must take into account the fact that women have less earning power and that this affects their pension entitlements."
"in writing. - (PL) As a result of social and demographic developments, changing value systems and a wider range of choice, the structure of rural areas is changing."
"The role of women in rural areas is also changing."
"What is now needed, in order to ensure that women remain in rural areas, or to encourage them to choose a rural lifestyle, is to take greater account of their needs and make sure that these needs are reflected in our support policy."
"We should ensure that women are more visible in rural areas, particular in the economic and financial spheres, and we should make instruments available to achieve these tasks."
"In view of the fact that it is still women who take care of young children and sick and elderly people, giving up work to do so, we should make it possible for them to achieve a balance between family life and professional life."
"This is possible by means of infrastructure development, for example, by building nurseries and developing various educational and cultural options."
"The key to achieving these aims will be to include women of all generations in decision-making processes."
"It is also of the utmost importance to improve access to medical services and cancer screening programmes for women."
"Furthermore, it is still worth supporting and developing agritourism as a low-risk form of economic activity which fosters job creation and work-life balance, and promoting electronic forms of entrepreneurship, such as e-commerce, which make it possible to be economically active regardless of how far you are from urban centres."
"in writing. - The EPLP supports the aim of Elisabeth Jeggle's report 'Role of Women in agriculture and rural areas' to highlight the sector specific problems faced by women working in agriculture and many of the measures proposed to strengthen their position."
"The report addresses the specific needs of women working in agriculture, by proposing a series of recommendations which take account both of their living conditions and their role and contribution to the development of the rural economy."
"However, the EPLP does not agree with the Paragraph 4, which speaks against further reducing the proportion of the total budget accounted by agricultural expenditure."
"We would like to see significant reprioritisation within the Multiannual Financial Framework to fully fund Europe 2020 priorities that have the greatest impact on raising employment and growth levels."
"in writing. - I supported this report, which highlights the importance of gender equality in promoting sustainable economic growth and rural development."
"I believe that it is important to encourage representation of women in all political, social and economic bodies of the agricultural sector, to ensure that women are participating on an equal basis."
"I am pleased at the adoption of Mrs Jeggle's report, to which I myself contributed."
"Indeed, the common agricultural policy is of social value in that it recognises the fundamental role women play in preserving the future prospects of rural life and prosperity in rural areas (given that 41% of the 14.6 million persons engaged in agriculture in the EU are women)."
"The aim in particular is to promote women's entrepreneurial attitude and farming skills, equip rural areas with modern infrastructure which will enable women to achieve a work-life balance (through the creation of day nurseries, for example), aim for a greater representation of women within political, economic and social bodies in the agricultural sector (by making absolute parity the goal) and implement adequate social cover for women working in agriculture as well as shared ownership of farms."
"If true equality is fairness, then recognising the role of women in agriculture is what really matters."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of this report."
"There is a continued need for an active support policy in rural areas aimed at offering women better prospects and better work opportunities."
"Qualified female farmers need broadly-based training and must be able to operate and think in an entrepreneurial way."
"This requires optimum infrastructure in rural areas when it comes to education, further training, schools and childcare, as well as unrestricted access to modern information technology."
"In addition, women's networks and access for women entrepreneurs to credit and investment opportunities must be expanded."
"I voted in favour of this report, which calls for an improvement in the situation and the recognition of women who work in agriculture and for the ongoing provision of rural aid."
"The report points out the crucial need to ensure social cover for female spouses of farmers who earn an income, and indeed for temporary and migrant workers."
"This should be an obvious step, not only for agricultural work, but also in the broader context of all self-employed professions, if we want to achieve true gender equality goals in these areas, where women are particularly badly treated."
"Therefore, yes, the promotion of gender equality must also be incorporated in the common agricultural policy and the Union must bring its stated objectives and its acts into line with each another."
"Nevertheless, I am under no illusions about the overall consistency between the Union's objectives and the use of European funds, especially with regard to human rights, of which women's rights are an integral part."
"in writing. - (DE) I have voted in favour of Mrs Jeggle's report."
"The report highlights the enormous contribution made by women in recent years to the sustainable development of rural areas and to the diversification and adaptation of farming to market changes."
"However, if women are to be offered real prospects in the agricultural sector, the common agricultural policy must encompass more female-oriented aspects, including (as explained in this report) the provision of specific forms of training and counselling, as well as infrastructural aid."
"in writing. - (PL) I would like to congratulate Mrs Jeggle on a document which makes a significant contribution to the debate on the shape of the common agricultural policy."
"A key factor affecting the increase in economic potential of rural areas is the involvement of women - both in political bodies and agricultural organisations and by means of self-employment."
"A key issue in terms of job creation is the promotion among women of electronic forms of entrepreneurship such as e-commerce, which make it possible to be economically active even in inaccessible areas."
"We should also make better use of opportunities aimed at developing community life in rural areas by drafting and implementing programmes supporting training systems for women's organisations."
"Something else which is of key significance in terms of equal opportunities is support for the putting in place of appropriate childcare infrastructure in rural areas, since properly functioning childcare makes it easier for women to return to work more quickly and makes them more competitive in the labour market."
"I would like to thank Mrs Jeggle once again for taking my proposals on board during her work on the report."
"Things which women asked for during public consultations I organised in the Ziemia Lubuska region were included in the document."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on the efficiency and effectiveness of EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in the new Member States."
"This is a very important document for Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia as they decommission nuclear power plants."
"There is concern that key waste infrastructure management projects have experienced delays in Lithuania and this is preventing it from absorbing EU funds in a timely and efficient manner."
"It is noted that considerable financing is still required for decommissioning and that national funds are not sufficient to cover this: the State Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant Decommissioning Fund has so far accumulated just over EUR 100 million (while the technical costs of decommissioning alone range from EUR 987 million to EUR 1 300 million)."
"The European Parliament therefore calls on the EU Member States to take appropriate measures in this respect."
"The decommissioning of nuclear power plants is a very complicated process."
"Countries do not have sufficient experience to be able to anticipate all the work involved and carry it out efficiently."
"The European Parliament is adopting this resolution at the right time, thus encouraging Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and all EU Member States to implement decommissioning work as efficiently as possible."
"This is very important work which will continue to receive much attention from the European Parliament."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this important document."
"When they joined the European Union, Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria made commitments that were politically and economically complex to decommission nuclear power plants, and the European Union made a commitment to allocate the financial assistance required for the decommissioning work, the construction of nuclear waste repositories, the storage of such waste and the development of energy projects."
"I believe that the concept of European Union solidarity can contribute effectively to mitigating the negative economic consequences of early closure in the energy sector, but many important issues remain unresolved."
"The issue of awards is not entirely clear, because it is now known that current funding will be insufficient to carry out the decommissioning work in a timely and proper manner."
"There is a danger that decommissioning the nuclear power plants will be delayed through lack of financial resources and this may pose a threat to the environment and human health."
"Detailed decommissioning plans have yet to be finalised, and, as a consequence, that there is insufficient information on the timetables, the costs of particular projects, and their sources of funding."
"I agree that the European Commission must play a greater coordinating role with these three Member States, in order to reach an agreement on the submission of detailed plans, the completion of work on schedule and the volume of funding."
"The Commission must also study ways of altering the EU's methods of financing decommissioning operations in view of the strategies employed in the Member States and their national administrative structures, and simplifying the rules on management of the funds in such a way that they do not affect the safety and security of the decommissioning operations."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for Mr Marinescu's report because, in my view, a lack of funding for decommissioning measures will delay the process of providing financial assistance to the three Member States in question: Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria."
"A delay in this process would pose a threat to the environment and human health."
"In the future evaluations carried out by the European Commission and the Court of Auditors of the European Union, the following aspects must be clarified: the allocation and use of funds by the EU for ensuring safe decommissioning, safe storage of nuclear waste and coordination between the three existing programmes."
"In this regard, the experience which has been accumulated must be used effectively and the model based on projects prepared and funded previously must be used in order to achieve a reduction in costs."
"I voted for our fellow Member's report on providing the financial assistance requested by Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria for shutting down nuclear power plants."
"It is glaringly obvious that if we do not provide suitable resources, we may face extremely serious consequences for the environment and human health."
"The resources allocated must certainly be managed in a proper and transparent manner."
"It is a serious concern that we do not have a single EU team of coordinators and experts for all three projects, which will supervise the drafting of a plan and clear timetable and the proper use of the funds already allocated, and decide what is required to complete the shutdown in safe conditions."
"The key word in this report is 'responsibility'."
"The nuclear industry must realise that it can no longer shirk its responsibility for nuclear power plant decommissioning, as it has so often done in the past."
"Decommissioning nuclear power plants that had generally insufficient safety standards was exactly what it pledged to do at the time of the various EU accession processes."
"Unfortunately, the allocated amounts were not used correctly."
"It is about time, therefore, that all the necessary conclusions were drawn from this."
"This observation may apply to the nuclear power plants in the new Member States, but it is still relevant for all EU countries that have opted for this technology."
"The disaster in Japan has made us all think about nuclear safety."
"Assistance in shutting down the plants in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria that were using obsolete technology contributes to minimising the consequences of the exceptional expenditure that their closure by 2013 entails."
"The aid is channelled into the environmental improvement and modernisation of new electrical systems, and into improving security of supply."
"I voted for this initiative because this should also be the future for other European nuclear plants with obsolete technology."
"in writing. - (IT) With this report Parliament does well to put pressure on the Commission to ensure that it continues to closely monitor and control the way in which Slovakia, Bulgaria and Lithuania have spent and will spend the considerable sums of finance from which they have benefited in the framework of the programme to dismantle their Soviet-era nuclear power stations to make them secure."
"The catastrophic accident in Japan a few weeks ago makes it clear to those who had not already realised that you do not trifle with nuclear energy: whenever one has anything to do with the atom, safety criteria must be applied with the utmost rigour, and the Commission must therefore take responsibility for monitoring the progress of the dismantling programmes of the old power stations in the three ex-communist countries."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour of Mr Marinescu's report, which draws attention to a problem that is currently highly topical."
"In light of what took place in Japan, questions arise now as to the safety of existing and functioning nuclear power stations in Europe."
"The commitment taken on by Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia during EU accession negotiations to dismantle old nuclear reactors that proved impossible to adapt to meet the required minimum safety standards, must be a sustained and coherent commitment, in respect of which the European Union has for some time now established and provided packages of support and finance."
"I hope that the dismantling works take place promptly and in a way that guarantees the maximum safety of citizens and the environment."
"I also hope that they are able to catch up on accrued delays and finish work by the end of the agreed time period."
"Finally I would like to stress, moving above and beyond specific cases, the need to monitor what checks are taking place on other reactors in Europe, making the institutions responsible for ensuring the safety not only of existing plants but also of new ones should more have to be built in the future."
"Compliance with nuclear safety standards and protection for the population against nuclear risk are particularly important aspects which justify the funding granted by the European Union to the three Member States for decommissioning their nuclear power stations, which could have no longer been modernised to meet the highest safety standards."
"However, I fully support the point of view expressed in this resolution as I think that we need to monitor the way in which these funds are spent so as to ensure that they make an effective contribution to guaranteeing the safety of the decommissioning process."
"Unfortunately, the strategies have been lacking in clarity, which has also resulted in a lack of any ceilings for the European Union's funding of the decommissioning activities."
"In future, such a way of working should be avoided, with the need for a comprehensive plan to be devised to cover all the actions which will be eligible for funding."
"It is vital to demonstrate transparency in the way this money is spent to guarantee the funding's effectiveness and, ultimately, to ensure that European taxpayers' money is being spent responsibly."
"in writing. - (PT) It is imperative that the nuclear reactors in Slovakia, Bulgaria and Lithuania be decommissioned, because they cannot meet the required minimum safety standards at an economically acceptable cost."
"This will not be possible without EU financial aid to address the consequences of their closure and decommissioning, which would naturally cover environmental upgrading measures, in line with the acquis, and measures for modernising conventional production capacity in order to replace production capacity, and so on."
"European Union financial assistance has been made available in the form of contributions to three International Decommissioning Support Funds administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development."
"in writing. - (RO) The European Union is concerned about the possible safety consequences from decommissioning the old nuclear power plants in new Member States and by the possible inadequate management of the radioactive waste they generate."
"The operations involved are generally exorbitant."
"This is why it is vital for the financial resources allocated by the EU to be managed properly and as transparently as possible, as well as adequate external supervision provided to ensure fair competition on the energy market."
"At the same time, the Union must constantly promote the development of alternative energy resources which have low emissions and are competitive, in order to remedy the adverse economic and social consequences arising from the process of decommissioning old nuclear power plants."
"Since 2007, three nuclear power plants in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria have been decommissioned with substantial financial support from the EU."
"In light of the delays and of the general mismanagement, Parliament is calling for the Commission to put together a coordination team to oversee planning and scheduling, review the use of the funds allocated to date and decide whether EU aid will still be required after 2013."
"Parliament has also demanded that the European Court of Auditors draft a special report on these three decommissioning programmes by the end of the year, in order to establish whether the money spent has truly helped to improve safety."
"Faced with the budgetary restrictions affecting all countries, Parliament will only agree to extend its assistance if EU funds have really served to improve the security of energy supply, modernise infrastructure and develop sustainable energy projects."
"Following the nuclear disaster in Japan, the EU is conscious of the extent of its responsibility and that it cannot afford to neglect the safety of its nuclear facilities."
"in writing. - (CS) The report on the effectiveness of EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in the new Member States presents a summary of EU funding for the disconnection and dismantling of the nuclear plants at Ignalina in Lithuania, Bohunice in Slovakia and Kozloduj in Bulgaria."
"Within the framework of EU accession talks, Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria undertook to close and decommission these nuclear plants which, under the G7 negotiations, could not be modernised at a financially acceptable cost, and in which it was impossible to secure the minimum safety standards."
"The EU undertook to fund the closure and decommissioning, and it is delivering the financial framework."
"I welcome the fact that the EU is able to support such activities."
"The decommissioning of old and unsafe nuclear power plants in Europe is essential for sustaining the life and health of European citizens."
"I hope that the oldest nuclear plants in France will also be shut down and decommissioned in a similar way."
"Germany decided to take a similar step immediately after the disaster in Japan."
"I will vote for the adoption of the report, as it is necessary to complete the process of closing and decommissioning the Ignalina, Bohunice a Kozloduj plants, with the appropriate funding from the EU."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report on EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in the new Member States."
"I believe that the EU should support the closure of these facilities and investment in alternative energy projects, in order to guarantee the safety and protect the health of the European public, to reduce energy dependency, and to minimise potential social costs."
"in writing. - (PT) Prior to their accession, the rules regarding nuclear energy and radioactive waste in place in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe were less stringent than the rules applicable in the EU at the time."
"In addition, some of these countries continued to operate old, Soviet-manufactured reactors that could not be adapted to the minimum required safety standards at an economically acceptable cost."
"For this reason, on accession, Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria undertook to decommission reactors not considered to meet the standards."
"The intervention and financial assistance of the EU was required for this, which is due to continue until 2013."
"Following the tragic events in Japan, I believe there is an urgent need to complete all the programmes for closing and decommissioning nuclear plants in Central and Eastern Europe whose operations do not comply with European safety standards."
"in writing. - (PT) Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria have fulfilled their obligations regarding the timely closure of the respective units in three nuclear power plants (NPPs)."
"Unit 1 at the Ignalina NPP was closed on 31 December 2004, and Unit 2 on 31 December 2009."
"Unit 1 of the V1 NPP in Bohunice was closed on 31 December 2006, and Unit 2 on 31 December 2008."
"Units 1 and 2 of the Kozloduy NPP were closed on 31 December 2002 and Units 3 and 4 on 31 December 2006."
"There is legal justification for the granting of financial assistance, with the amounts for this being set annually by Commission decision based on individual annual combined programming documents, permitting control over the development and financing of the approved projects."
"The purpose of the EU assistance is to support these three Member States in coping with the financial and economical burden caused by early fixed closure dates, and to cover the cost of many important decommissioning activities, invest in energy projects with the aim of reducing energy dependency and help to mitigate the social impact of the decommissioning of the power plants."
"We know that the average age of reactors in operation in nuclear plants in nearly half of the Member States of the European Union is relatively high, which has created the need to decommission some of these reactors for reasons of safety, and of defending and safeguarding public health and the environment."
"In the case of the new Member States, faced with the requirement to decommission a number of units, it seems only right to us that they can expect EU support to properly and safely complete the decommissioning processes."
"These processes should include necessary maintenance and surveillance following shutdown, waste treatment, waste and spent fuel storage and decontamination, the environmental upgrading of facilities, and support for replacing the production capacity of shut-down plants, paying particular attention to environmental sustainability and energy efficiency."
"Finally, it should be noted that the social consequences of these processes also need to be taken into account, guaranteeing - in addition to all safety conditions, before, during and after decommissioning - that workers' jobs and other rights will be safeguarded."
"in writing. - Paragraph 7 of the Marinescu report notes that the decommissioning of certain nuclear power stations in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria 'should be assigned the highest priority in the interests of the safety and health of all the people of Europe'."
"I fully agree with that statement but would go further: a complete move away from nuclear power in all Member States would be in the interests of the safety and health of our people."
"in writing. - (LT) As you know, Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria operated old soviet design nuclear reactors which the international community concluded could not be upgraded to meet the minimum required safety standards at an economically acceptable cost."
"In recognition of the fact that the early closure represented an exceptional financial burden, and as an act of solidarity, the European Union committed itself to provide adequate additional financial assistance for the decommissioning of these reactor units until the end of 2013."
"However, there is concern that key waste infrastructure management projects (spent fuel storage and waste repository project) have experienced serious delays."
"Available slack in the system is almost exhausted and delays may start to impinge upon the critical path for the whole decommissioning plan, with a commensurate increase in cost."
"The Commission should report on the results of the reassessment of the project timeline."
"A large portion of the funds was allocated to energy projects, but considerable financing is still required for decommissioning and national funds are not sufficient to cover this: the State Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant Decommissioning Fund has failed to accumulate sufficient funds."
"The technical costs of decommissioning alone range from EUR 987 million to EUR 1 300 million."
"The EU Member States must take appropriate measures in this respect."
"Furthermore, as far as nuclear safety is concerned, we must discuss the new nuclear power plants with nuclear reactors that are planned on the EU's borders, in Russia and Belarus."
"These may represent a new challenge for the EU that could in future pose a real threat to the health of our people and our environment."
"in writing. - (DE) Nuclear reactors in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria cannot be modernised at an economically viable cost to ensure that they meet the required minimum safety standards."
"As part of their accession negotiations, these three countries have undertaken to shut down and decommission the nuclear reactors within an agreed timetable."
"In order to press ahead with an efficient shutdown, we need a clear financial framework and controls for the correct use of the funds provided."
"I support Mr Marinescu's report because the safety of Europe's citizens must be our top priority."
"in writing. - (IT) The subject of the efficiency and efficacy of the EU's financing of projects to decommission nuclear power stations in the new Member States is relevant now more than ever."
"The recent events in Japan have made safety concerns more pressing than ever before."
"The report by Mr Marinescu examines, more specifically, the provision of adequate financial resources to guarantee the decommissioning of nuclear power stations in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria."
"Indeed, on their entry to the European family, these states assumed responsibility for decommissioning the nuclear power plants on their territories."
"The EU is committed to providing sufficient financial support to meet these obligations."
"In fact, I believe that the European Union must propose decisive action on certain subjects that its citizens hold close to their hearts, including that of the safety of nuclear power plants."
"When Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria joined the European Union, a shutdown and decommissioning plan was drawn up for a number of old nuclear power plants failing to meet European standards."
"Thanks to the release of very substantial appropriations, which will total EUR 2 848 million by the end of 2013, it has been possible to shut down all of those plants and to ensure a partial conversion to other energy sources in those Member States."
"However, a number of the commitments made do not seem to have been honoured, and one is entitled to wonder about the use of the allocated funds."
"That is why I voted in favour of this European Parliament resolution."
"Highlighting the almost non-existent progress in decommissioning, despite this being the main reason for the programme, the resolution calls on the Commission to implement this assistance more effectively, by producing an annual progress report, for example."
"To this end, the Commission could build on the audit currently being carried out by the European Court of Auditors."
"It should also put together a team of coordinators and experts to cover all three projects, which, curiously enough, it has still not done."
"in writing. - I voted for this report which deals with the three countries, Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria, that operated old soviet design nuclear reactors which the international community, in line with the G7 multilateral programme of action adopted at the Munich G7 summit in 1992, concluded could not be upgraded to meet the minimum required safety standards at an economically acceptable cost."
"In the context of the negotiations for accession to the European Union, the three countries took the commitment to close and subsequently decommission these nuclear reactors on fixed dates."
"In recognition of the fact that the early closure represented an exceptional financial burden and as act of solidarity, the European Union committed itself to provide adequate additional financial assistance for decommissioning these reactor units until the end of 2013."
"in writing. - (PT) This report is on EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in the new Member States."
"These plants represent a danger to public health and to the ecosystem, not only in their country of origin, but also throughout Europe and the world."
"With regard to the subject matter of the report, I voted in favour of contributing to the decommissioning of these old plants."
"However, I believe that EU nuclear policy should go further."
"Given the serious risks connected with nuclear power that have been well known for a long time, and the nuclear disaster currently being experienced in Japan, I call for the immediate establishment of a European plan for abandoning this type of energy."
"I also believe that the EU should immediately suspend funding and support for new nuclear plants."
"This report deals with the decommissioning of nuclear power plants that have fallen into disrepair and present an immediate threat to the health of all EU citizens."
"It only partially calls into question the so-called 'energy' component of the EU financial assistance allocated to this decommissioning programme."
"This House must clearly condemn this financing of new nuclear power plants."
"It is not doing so, and nor is it demanding the abandonment of nuclear power, necessary though it is."
"With the Fukushima disaster having happened only a few days ago, this is shamefully short-sighted."
"I call for the immediate implementation of a European plan to phase out nuclear power."
"I voted in favour, with particular reference to the financing of the decommissioning of the nuclear power plants covered by this report."
"in writing. - (PT) Nuclear safety is a concern for everyone in Europe."
"The recent accident in Japan has highlighted the risks inherent to nuclear plants."
"Eastern European states seeking to become part of the EU have nuclear plants using Soviet technology that have been operational for many years and are reaching the end of their lifespans."
"Given the substantial cost of decommissioning these structures, it is only natural for the EU to support these countries in their efforts toward this decommissioning, so that no nuclear accident will occur in European territory, with consequences that are, unfortunately, well known to all of us."
"I voted for this report on the efficiency and effectiveness of EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in the new Member States, because it notes that the decommissioning of the nuclear power plants concerned should be assigned the highest priority in the interests of the safety and health of all the people of Europe, and because it expresses fear that a lack of financial resources for decommissioning measures will delay the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and threaten the environment and human health."
"The Fukushima accident is proof that nuclear energy is uncontrollable in the event of a disaster, and that its management cannot be in private hands."
"We therefore urgently require a moratorium so that no further nuclear plants will be built, and we need to establish a timetable for closing the 143 plants that currently exist in Europe."
"The EU must move toward a future free of nuclear plants and based on renewable energy sources."
"in writing. - The resolution assesses plans to decommission out-of-date nuclear stations in three EU countries: Ignalina in Lithuania, Bohunice in Slovakia, Kozloduy in Bulgaria."
"The resolution also estimates expenditure and delays in possible funding of energy projects which are not related to decommissioning."
"'Possible funding' is well said."
"It is necessary to define clearly and specifically exactly how powerful energy sources will be substituted, where and when new electric stations will be constructed by our financial means."
"I voted 'for' because I understand the hazard of nuclear stations, but what is the sense in decommissioning Ignalina while other nuclear stations have not yet been built in the European Union?"
"Maybe it is better to carry out reconstruction works?"
"in writing. - (DE) Upgrades to some nuclear reactors in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria to ensure that they meet the required minimum safety standard are either impossible or come at an economically unreasonable cost."
"Under the terms of EU accession negotiations, these Central and Eastern European States were provided with funding to help with the decommissioning of outdated reactors."
"Around EUR 1 300 million had been paid out to Lithuania (Ignalina), Slovakia (Bohunice V1) and Bulgaria (Kozloduy) up to 2009."
"The EU is committed to further payments until the end of 2013."
"During the Russian-Ukrainian gas crisis, Slovakia considered reactivating the decommissioned Bohunice power plant in order to make up for the energy deficit caused by the lack of gas supplies from Russia."
"Japan has shown us how easily a nuclear power plant can get out of control."
"This makes it all the more important that outdated reactors should be shut down, while at the same time building up alternative sources of energy to prevent reactivation by the back door."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (RO) There is absolutely no question that in the interest of the safety and health of all European citizens, the EU and Member States must give top priority to the decommissioning of the relevant nuclear power plants in the new Member States."
"However, just as much attention should also be focused on eliminating the dangers in the immediate vicinity of the European Union."
"On this point, I am highlighting the urgent need to identify and mobilise the funds required to build a new sarcophagus on top of the Chernobyl power plant reactor which exploded in 1986."
"I agreed with this resolution on the efficiency and effectiveness of EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria."
"Above all, we must strive to ensure that all decommissioning work is carried out in time while properly implementing all the necessary safety measures and eliminating even minimal risks to human health and the environment."
"If we are committed to decommissioning Ignalina and other nuclear power plants, all financial resources allocated to this process must be used as intended following the principle of transparency and efficiency."
"National authorities must finalise detailed decommissioning plans as a matter of urgency."
"I believe that the results of the audit carried out by the European Court of Auditors will reveal the objectives of the use of the funds and their effectiveness."
"We must make every effort to ensure that dismantling activities and management of decommissioning waste will have started by 2013."
"I believe that it is advisable to require the Commission to present the European Parliament with a detailed financing plan and identify responsibility for the use of European Union assistance."
"Given the fact that state funds for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants have not accumulated a sufficient amount, it would be advisable for the strategies and plans drawn up to include new actions and provide for additional EU funds accordingly."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour of the text on EU funding for the decommissioning of nuclear power stations in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria because, in light of recent events following the earthquake and nuclear crisis in Japan, I believe it is fundamental and crucial that the European Union adopts a policy of safety checks on nuclear reactors which will remove any degree of risk."
"Old Soviet-design nuclear reactors were active in the territories of the countries in question, and these have proved technically impossible to modernise to meet currently required international safety standards."
"Funding provided by the EU is consistent with the economic burden borne by these countries in order to close the nuclear power stations."
"in writing. - (PT) As part of the EU accession negotiations, Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria negotiated support for the decommissioning of old nuclear reactors of Soviet design that, in the opinion of the international community and in line with the 1992 Munich G7 summit, could not be adapted to minimum required safety standards at an economically acceptable cost."
"In the context of the accession negotiations, the three countries undertook to close and subsequently decommission these reactors on fixed dates."
"Recognising that early closure represented an exceptional financial burden, and in solidarity, the European Union undertook to provide adequate additional financial assistance for the decommissioning of these reactors up to the end of 2013."
"The assistance programme has been subject to regular audits and assessments."
"The European Court of Auditors (ECA) is currently carrying out audits of the results of the three programmes, and a report is expected in autumn 2011."
"It can already be concluded that synergies could have been created between the three projects to make the EU action more efficient and effective."
"I voted in favour of this report, from which I would stress the Commission's recommendation for harmonising the rules on funding the decommissioning of nuclear reactors."
"in writing. - (IT) The European Parliament's motion for a resolution on the efficiency and efficacy of the EU's financing for the decommissioning of nuclear power stations in the new Member States, as presented on 14 March 2011, aims to ascertain what stages have been reached in the dismantling of obsolete nuclear power stations in Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia, which since 1999 have benefited from financial assistance from the EU for this project."
"The safety of energy supply is one of the fundamental priorities in the EU's energy strategy."
"According to current forecasts, the delays experienced by the programmes to date will not prevent the start of the processes of dismantlement and management of nuclear waste nor will it affect works to be carried out by power station personnel by 2013."
"Nonetheless, it remains a serious concern that the decommissioning plans have yet to be finalised, and that efforts will have to be made to improving the management of financial resources as well as coordination between the national authorities of the relevant Member States."
"For these reasons, I am voting in favour of the motion for a resolution."
"in writing. - The three countries, Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria, operated old soviet-design nuclear reactors that the international community, in line with the G7 multilateral programme of action adopted at the Munich G7 summit in 1992, concluded could not be upgraded to meet the minimum required safety standards at an economically acceptable cost."
"In the context of the negotiations for accession to the European Union, the three countries took the commitment to close and subsequently decommission these nuclear reactors on fixed dates."
"In recognition of the fact that the early closure represented an exceptional financial burden and as act of solidarity, the European Union committed itself to provide adequate additional financial assistance for decommissioning these reactor units until the end of 2013."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour of this report because I consider it of prime importance for us to continue to closely monitor the decommissioning phase of nuclear power plants in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria where, at the moment of their entry into the European Union, old Soviet-design nuclear reactors were still in operation, which have proved impossible to upgrade to more recent safety standards at a sustainable cost."
"After the recent disaster in Japan, falling behind with these procedures is no longer possible, for the sake of the safety of all citizens in Europe and elsewhere, and moreover the exceptional financial burden associated with the decommissioning process can no longer be used as an excuse for potential delay."
"For this reason, the European Union is committed to supplying adequate financial assistance to decommission these reactors before the end of 2013."
"In the interests of the entire European Union, no further delay can be tolerated and should be immediately denounced on all the most relevant occasions."
"in writing. - (IT) Following the nuclear disaster caused by the power plant in Japan, which was also related to a failure to adapt to current safety standards, we can say we have made an excellent choice when, during accession negotiations, dates were set for the definitive shut-down of three old Soviet-design nuclear power plants in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria."
"The date for the definitive shut-down and subsequent safe maintenance was set at 2013, with a cost to the European Union of almost EUR 3 billion."
"Following delays and cost increases linked to the securing of the three power plants, the report invites the Commission to exercise greater supervision, to establish what the current state of play is and the expected timeframe for the completion of different phases of the decommissioning process according to the original timetable."
"in writing. - (NL) Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria had old, Soviet-period nuclear plants that the international community decided could not be upgraded to meet minimum safety requirements for an economically reasonable cost."
"The accession negotiations were used to get the three nuclear power plants closed by a set date and subsequently dismantled."
"2.7 billion euro was set aside for this over the 1999-2013 period."
"At the end of 2009, EUR 1.8 billion of this had already been allocated."
"Despite this, there have been considerable delays in the implementation of the dismantlement programmes."
"The European Parliament fears that these delays will lead to risks for the environment and human health."
"I am satisfied with this report, not least because this House backed my amendments, which were tabled in the Committee on Budgetary Control and called for the funds to be managed and their resources to be used with absolute transparency."
"The European Parliament also adopted my proposal to have the Commission report annually to Parliament and inform us of whether its forecasts that the resources set aside will be absorbed over the next three years prove accurate."
"This report forms the basis for very close monitoring of this process and that is a positive thing from a wide variety of points of view."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report as I support the gradual decommissioning of nuclear power plants."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of this report."
"The dismantling of the plants in Ignalina, Bohunice and Kozloduy is taking too long and greater commitment should be required from the national operators."
"It is urgently necessary for all Member States also to urge common standards for the dismantling of plants."
"Clear areas of responsibility must be defined."
"In their EU accession negotiations, the three countries, namely Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria, declared their willingness to remove these three unsafe nuclear power plants from the network."
"in writing. - (LT) The tragic events that occurred last month in Japan and concern over the safety of the Fukushima power plant have led to much discussion of nuclear power plants."
"It is very important for these discussions to take place - many Lithuanians remember the Chernobyl tragedy only too well."
"The closure of Lithuania's Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant was one of the conditions for EU membership, but this has been very painful."
"The EU provided Lithuania with EUR 837 million of assistance to eliminate the consequences of the closure of the nuclear power plant over the period 2007-2013."
"However, it is not enough to simply receive the financing from the EU allocated for the closure of the reactor."
"Safe decommissioning is a long road and the EU must support Lithuania at every step of the way."
"This should include comprehensive support - the management of radioactive waste and dangerous waste."
"As the rapporteur states, comprehensive EU support is important for reducing the economic and social consequences of the closure of Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant."
"The closure of the nuclear power plant made many Lithuanians redundant and damaged our economy."
"The EU must provide more assistance for projects in the energy sector in order to mitigate the economic consequences of the closure of Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant."
"This might include promoting the renewal of measures to increase energy output and energy efficiency."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the report on the decommissioning of the three nuclear reactors in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria."
"Because these nuclear reactors do not meet even the minimum safety standards, their dismantling was one of the conditions agreed to by the three countries during accession negotiations and the European Union undertook to cover part of the dismantling costs."
"In this context, it is particularly good news to know that the closure of the Ignalina plant in Lithuania means that the country's only nuclear power plant has been taken offline."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was created in 2006 in order to provide additional assistance for workers affected by the consequences of significant changes in the structure of international trade and to assist in their reintegration into the labour market."
"Since 1 May 2009, the remit of the EGF has been expanded to include support for workers made redundant as a direct consequence of economic, financial and social crises."
"At this time when we are facing this severe crisis, one of the principal consequences of which is an increase in unemployment, the EU should use all the means at its disposal to react, particularly as regards support to be provided for those who are facing the day-to-day reality of unemployment."
"That is why I voted for this report relating to the mobilisation of the EGF in favour of the Czech Republic, with the objective of supporting workers made redundant from Unilever ČR spol.s r.o."
"The aid includes 460 of the 664 workers made redundant by the company Unilever ČR, who were employed in the retail sector: 52.4% of those affected are women, 13% are older than 54 years and 9.1% younger than 24 years."
"It should be stressed that the measures that will aid with the training of the redundant workers will be co-financed by the company, which is not ducking its responsibilities, and will be put into practice by contractors or companies working on its behalf."
"in writing. - (CS) It is a success of the European Parliament that the 2011 budget allocates for the first time payment resources amounting to EUR 47 608 950 in the budget item for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF)."
"The EGF was created as a separate specific instrument with its own targets and deadlines, and it therefore deserves its own dedicated resources, thus avoiding transfers from other budget items, which happened in the past and which might frustrate the achievement of various political objectives."
"In my opinion, the EGF has proved its worth, and my only concern is that the new Member States have not made greater use of it."
"The impression may ultimately arise that the aim of the EGF is for the old Member States to get the EU budgetary resources they were formerly used to within the framework of, for example, the cohesion policy."
"In my opinion, the first Czech request in history for a grant from the EGF is the first swallow, after which others will follow, because Czech industry too has been hit by globalisation and the worldwide financial crisis, and Czech workers who have been laid off deserve European assistance in their efforts to succeed in a challenging labour market."
"in writing. - (CS) The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established in 2006 as a flexible instrument for the rapid provision of one-off, time-limited individual support to help workers laid off as a result of globalisation or the financial and economic crisis."
"This marks the first release of resources from the fund for the Czech Republic since the eruption of the global economic and financial crisis, and it is specifically for mitigating the consequences of the lay-off of 634 workers of the Unilever company, which has shut down a factory in the municipality of Nelahozeves."
"In view of the fact that 52.4% of those laid off are women, and more than 13% of the workers laid off are over 54 years old, I consider the release of resources for the Czech Republic to be very proper, and I therefore voted in favour of the report."
"I am pleased with the work carried out on the basis of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), namely in supporting workers affected by changes in world trade."
"In the same way, I support the decision on the mobilisation of the EGF in favour of the Czech Republic, for the benefit of workers in the company Unilever, which has seen more than 500 unexpected redundancies as a result of the world economic and financial crisis."
"This decision is therefore of great importance, not only for the workers and their families, but for the district of Melník, where the Unilever facilities are situated, the economy of which is largely dependent on the food processing industry, and the chemical and energy industries."
"I voted in favour of this report and of the amendment calling for a review of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF)."
"This is because I regret that the EGF as it stands does not require an investigation into the financial health, possible tax evasion or state aid situation of multinational companies whose restructuring justifies the intervention of the EGF."
"I believe that this ought to be addressed in the forthcoming revision of the EGF Regulation without compromising redundant workers' access to the EGF."
"in writing. - (SV) We have chosen again this time to support the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund - this time to help a total of around 1 200 people who have lost their jobs in Poland and the Czech Republic - because Europe is still suffering the effects of the economic crisis and exceptional times require exceptional measures."
"However, we believe that in future we should instead use instruments that already exist - in particular the European Social Fund - in order to increase the employability of those who have been given notice or have been made redundant."
"There will probably be no need for the Globalisation Adjustment Fund in the next budgetary period."
"in writing. - (PT) The request relates to 634 redundancies from the company Unilever ČR, which operates in the retail sector in the Czech region of Střední Čechy."
"As with this year's first request relating to the Polish region of Podkarpackie, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has made a favourable assessment of this process's compliance with the eligibility criteria."
"I cannot fail to note with regret the spread of redundancies throughout the Union, indicating that a great deal still needs to be done to reverse the cycle of crisis in which we are mired."
"I support the Commission's proposal to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), and hope that the redundant workers will be able to find new jobs as quickly as possible."
"This report is on a draft decision of the European Parliament and Council on the mobilisation of EUR 323 820 from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), to support the reintegration of Czech workers made redundant as a result of the current economic and financial crisis."
"This application, the second to be approved under the 2011 EU Budget, was submitted to the Commission on 24 March 2010 and concerns 634 workers from the company Unilever ČR, in the Střední Čechy region, who were working in the retail sector."
"Given that this involves a specific budgetary instrument, and that the amount requested is legally acceptable and complies with the provisions of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission, namely point 28, I am voting in favour of this proposal, and hope that it contributes to reducing the economic difficulties of this region's inhabitants, and to relaunching the local economy."
"Another mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), this time to support workers made redundant from a factory owned by the multinational Unilever in the Czech Republic."
"As on other occasions, we voted in favour."
"Nevertheless, in addition to the reservations that we always express in these situations, there are particular aspects of this process that need to be stressed."
"The European Commission has limited itself to stating that Unilever did not receive any aid from state or EU funds to open the factory in the Czech Republic, before or after its accession to the EU."
"However, the Commission has not provided information, as it should have done and it was asked to do, on what is happening regarding the group's other factories, arguing that it is not obliged to do so under the EGF Regulation."
"In addition to what has taken place in the specific case of the Czech Republic, it would be interesting to find out about and assess the Unilever group's behaviour at European level."
"We therefore regret the lack of information relating to public assistance awarded to this group, as well as to multinational companies generally whose restructuring is the reason for EGF interventions."
"This is another mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), which in this case seeks to benefit workers made redundant from the multinational Unilever's Czech factory."
"The European Commission's position in this area has been very controversial, as it has restricted itself to stating that Unilever did not receive any state aid or financial support from European funds to open the factory in the Czech Republic, before or after its accession to the EU."
"However, the Commission has not provided information, as it should have done and it was asked to do, on what is happening with other factories within the group, arguing that it is not obliged to do so under the EGF Regulation."
"I therefore drew attention, during the debate in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, to the fact that that no information was available on what is happening with the Unilever group at European level, and I proposed that this issue be taken into account during the review of the Regulation, so that there can be an examination of the financial situation, including state aid, of the multinational companies whose restructuring is the reason for EGF interventions, without compromising access to the fund for redundant workers."
"We therefore voted in favour of these proposals."
"I voted in favour of this report on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in support of the food industry employees (UNILEVER) in the Czech Republic."
"I would stress, however, that there is an urgent need to review the regulation of that fund as soon as possible."
"To this end, during the vote I co-signed and secured the adoption of an amendment specifying that it is detrimental for the regulation not to require an investigation into the financial health, possible tax evasion or state aid situation of multinationals which benefit from the intervention of the EGF."
"At a time when the European Union is struggling to finance its objectives and is obliged to choose between policies of equally high priority, the Community budget cannot afford to fund the market entry and relocation strategies of large multinational companies whose sole intention is to increase their profits."
"This must be taken into account in the forthcoming regulation, without prejudicing redundant workers by compromising their access to the EGF."
"in writing. - (CS) I recommend voting in favour of the Barbara Matera report on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), within the framework of which the Czech Republic has submitted its first request for support."
"I consider it important to emphasise the significance of this fund, which was created under Czech social democrat commissioner Vladimír Špidla."
"The financial and economic earthquake that followed has deprived many people throughout Europe of their jobs."
"The resources from the EGF fund only those measures which smooth the way to a new job for people who have been made redundant, who have signed up to the professional training programmes and acquired a skill answering to the needs of the labour market, or who have become self-employed."
"Pursuant to Mrs Matera's report, I can recapitulate that Unilever has fulfilled all of the criteria."
"Unilever ČR had to close the plant in Nelahozeves due to the effects of the economic crisis, and the lay-offs affected most of the workers."
"Unilever offered all of those leaving a comprehensive support programme for finding new employment, and the firm cooperated closely with the local employment office in managing the programme."
"I can therefore agree with the release of resources based on the information in this report, and with the Commission's proposal to pay the Czech Republic EUR 323 820 from the EGF."
"in writing. - (LT) The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established to provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market."
"The scope of the EGF was broadened for applications submitted from 1 May 2009 to include support for workers made redundant as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis."
"The Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 allows the mobilisation of the EGF within the annual ceiling of EUR 500 million."
"On 24 March 2010, the Czech Republic submitted an application to mobilise the EGF in respect of cases concerning 634 redundancies (all targeted for assistance) in the enterprise Unilever ČR, spol.sr.o, operating in the retail sector (food products), and supplemented it by additional information up to 20 September 2010."
"This application complies with the requirements for determining the financial contributions."
"The Commission, therefore, proposes to mobilise an amount of EUR 323 820."
"I therefore agreed that the EGF should be mobilised in order to provide a financial contribution for the application submitted by the Czech Republic."
"I also believe that other EU Member States should take more advantage of the opportunities offered by the EU funds."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of the Czech Republic, because I consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers experiencing difficulty on account of the economic crisis."
"Today's vote concerned a request for support for 634 workers in the enterprise Unilever ČR, operating in the retail sector in the NUTS II region of Střední Čechy, amounting to a sum of EUR 323 820 financed by the EGF."
"Finally, I should like to emphasise the importance of the EGF, which has been shown to be a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis."
"in writing. - I welcome this report which releases funds from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to assist workers made redundant in the Czech Republic."
"The application relates to 634 redundancies that occurred following the closure of a Unilever plant in Nelahozeves in the last quarter of 2009."
"Four hundred and sixty redundant workers will benefit from personalised measures supported by EGAF funding to a total of EUR 0.32 million."
"I am abstaining out of consideration for the Czech workers who have been sacrificed on the altar of globalisation."
"The precarious situation in which they find themselves is simply the consequence of the neoliberal EU policies which this fund endorses and supports."
"I am voting against, because the handout granted to the victims of these policies is pitiful compared to the profits being reaped elsewhere."
"The EU is an area of solidarity and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is part of that."
"This aid is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of company relocations that occur in a globalised context."
"More and more companies are relocating, taking advantage of low labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with damaging effects on countries that respect workers' rights."
"The EGF is intended to help workers who are victims of company relocations, and it is essential for facilitating access to new employment."
"The EGF has been used by other EU countries in the past, so now it is appropriate to grant this aid to the Czech Republic, which has applied for assistance with regard to 634 redundancies - all potential beneficiaries of aid - from the company Unilever ČR, spol.sr.o, which operates in the retail sector in the NUTS II region of Střední Čechy."
"Although I voted in favour of this proposal to provide assistance to the workers of Unilever in the Czech Republic, I believe that this is an analgesic and palliative measure for the consequences of the capitalist model, and that it does not represent any real progress in the fight against the root causes of the crisis."
"I agree with the mobilisation of resources from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for people made redundant due to structural changes in trade patterns or as a direct consequence of the current economic and financial crisis."
"I believe that the EGF can contribute to the ultimate goal of facilitating these workers' reintegration into the labour market."
"I also voted in favour because I am convinced that this assistance complements the redundancy aid provided for in all national legislation and collective agreements."
"Therefore, this mobilisation of funds from the EGF cannot under any circumstances replace or avoid the legal responsibilities of governments and companies to employees who have been made redundant."
"in writing. - (DE) The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was established to protect workers who have been made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis."
"The Czech Republic has applied for support for 634 redundancies."
"It is only right and proper that we should offer personal support to workers who have been made redundant as a result of globalisation and the economic crisis, aiding their reintegration into the labour market."
"I therefore voted in favour of this."
"in writing. - (IT) The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a fund allocated by the Union to provide economic support to certain sectors in difficulty within Members States or to those sectors which are expanding towards the average standards of the Union."
"It is for this reason that I voted in favour of Mrs Matera's report."
"For 2011 the Union's budget line for payments from funds of this sort has been increased by EUR 50 million, and therefore it is easier to provide funding to a wider range of sectors."
"Specifically, these are the first requests for mobilisation in 2011 from the machinery production and manufacturing sector in the Czech Republic and Poland."
"The fund (of almost one million euros) will go to support workers specialising in the trade and production of machinery."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was created to provide additional support for workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns."
"On 15 February 2011, the Commission adopted a new draft decision on mobilising the EGF in favour of the Czech Republic, with the aim of supporting the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant as a result of the world economic and financial crisis."
"This is the second application to be examined under the 2011 budget, and it relates to the mobilisation of the total sum of EUR 323 820."
"The process refers to the redundancy of 594 workers - all potential beneficiaries of aid - from the company Unilever ČR, spol.sr., which operates in the retail sector in the region of Střední, during the four-month reference period between 16 September 2009 and 16 January 2010."
"The Commission's assessment concluded that there is a link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns or the financial and economic crisis, and that these redundancies were unforeseen in nature."
"The application meets all of the eligibility criteria set out in the EGF Regulation, which is why I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the fund."
"The Czech Republic's application for intervention by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) relates to 634 redundancies that occurred during the period between 16 September 2009 and 16 January 2010 inclusive at the company Unilever ČR, spol.sr.o, which operates in the retail sector in the NUTS II region of Střední Čechy, meets all of the legally defined eligibility criteria."
"Under Regulation (EC) No 546/2009 of the European Parliament and Council of 18 June 2009, which amended Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and Council of 20 December 2006 establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the EGF's scope was temporarily expanded to cover its intervention in situations like this, in which, as a direct result of the world economic and financial crisis, there are 'at least 500 redundancies over a period of nine months, particularly in small or medium-sized enterprises, in a NACE 2 division in one region or two contiguous regions at NUTS II level'."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution, in the hope that the mobilisation of the EGF would contribute to the effective reintegration of these workers into the labour market."
", in writing - (CS) I voted in favour of the report on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for the Czech Republic, and specifically for former employees of the Unilever company, and I am pleased the report has been adopted."
"I am sorry that the British conservatives voted against it, and that the Czech chairman of the European Conservatives and Reformists could not get them to change their minds, even though this is the first time that the Czech Republic has made use of resources from this fund."
"in writing. - As usually in this type of reports, the EP:"
"1. Requests the institutions involved to make the necessary efforts to accelerate the mobilisation of the EGF; appreciates in this sense the improved procedure put in place by the Commission, following the EP request for accelerating the release of grants, aimed at presenting to the budgetary authority the Commission's assessment on the eligibility of an EGF application together with the proposal to mobilise the Fund; hopes that further improvements in the procedure will be reached in the framework of the upcoming reviews of the Fund;"
"2. Recalls the institutions' commitment to ensuring a smooth and rapid procedure for the adoption of the decisions on the mobilisation of the EGF, providing one-off, time-limited individual support geared to helping workers who have been made redundant as a result of globalisation and the financial and economic crisis; points out the role that the EGF can play in the reintegration of workers made redundant into the labour market; however, calls for an evaluation on the long-term integration of these workers into the labour market as a direct result of the EGF-funded measures."
"in writing. - (IT) On 15 February 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the EGF in favour of the Czech Republic, in order to support the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis."
"The question under examination refers to 634 redundancies, all targeted for assistance from the fund, made by the Unilever enterprise operating in the retail sector in the NUTS II region of Střední Čechy, during the four-month reference period of the four months from 16 September 2009 to 16 January 2010."
"My vote in favour of today's resolution confirms the favourable opinion I have already expressed at the meeting of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"in writing. - (CS) The release of funds from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund will support the reintegration of 460 workers affected by the closure of the Unilever company in the municipality of Nelahozeves in Central Bohemia in the Czech Republic."
"In view of the fact that this will involve significant help in solving the social impacts connected with the mass lay-off in this small community, I have voted for the adoption of this report."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report which will provide funding for personalised measures to help workers who have been made redundant in the Czech Republic."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a controversial mechanism."
"Officially, this fund enables the European Union to finance concrete actions to offset the effects of the crisis."
"It is as much use as a plaster on a wooden leg."
"However, this mechanism is used on an ad hoc basis and only in certain cases."
"In reality it is being used to finance redundancy plans."
"Today, the European Parliament has taken this hypocrisy even further by allocating a proportion of this fund to Unilever, which has just closed its Czech Republic factories and made over 600 people redundant, while its net profits have risen by 26% to EUR°4.6°billion."
"I therefore voted against this report, which raises a more general issue than that of the Unilever case."
"How can national and European public bodies, given the employment crisis we are facing, continue to use public money to subsidise multinational companies which lay off employees despite being in profit, and which are therefore putting their shareholders' interests before their employees'?"
"in writing. - (DE) I can only endorse the amendment tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament requiring that a company be evaluated as a whole when awarding funds from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF)."
"I have made such calls many times in the Committee on Budgets."
"However, I found myself unable to vote in favour of the report as a whole."
"Czech company Unilever ČR spol.sr.o, which is active in the retail sector, has made 634 workers redundant and has sought support measures for all those who have lost their jobs (the individual measures are normally only needed for some of the redundant workforce to help reintegrate them into the labour market)."
"As emphasised in every report in which Parliament approves EGF funding, claims on the structural funds should not be used in place of measures for which businesses themselves are responsible according to the collective agreements."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution on dual-use items and technology, meaning goods which can be used for both civil and military purposes."
"Controlling the export of dual-use goods is a key for the non-proliferation of arms, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD)."
"It is therefore very important to ensure that the EU's Dual-Use Regime becomes more democratic and transparent, while at the same time ensuring that it is sufficiently strict."
"Currently, the requirements applied for the export of dual-use items and technology vary in stringency."
"I believe that the EU should aim to apply the strictest export regimes on every item, and this should be applicable to all of its Member States."
"The Commission must establish an effective system in this area, which would facilitate the collection of credible data on the end use of the dual-use items exported from the Union."
"in writing. - (LT) Controlling the export of dual-use goods (for civil and military purposes) is a key for the non-proliferation of arms, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD)."
"For 15 years the EU has been tightening control of the export of dual-use goods, relying on preventive measures such as the imposition of export licensing requirements and customs registration procedures."
"However, given constant technological changes and new threats, it is necessary to regularly update lists of controlled dual-use items that reflect those of the main international export control regimes."
"The main task of these international export control regimes is to update the lists of goods to be controlled."
"To date, these lists have been quasi-automatically transposed into EU legislation without any participation by the European Parliament, but with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament's approval is now required."
"I agreed with this report and the European Parliament's proposals that strive to ensure more democratic and transparent EU control regimes for dual-use goods and a greater role for the Commission in assessing the implementation of this regulation in the Member States."
"I voted for this report because the control of exports of dual-use items is a key factor in the non-proliferation of weapons, especially weapons of mass destruction."
"Given the large volume of cross-border trade in the European Union, the enforcement of controls on EU exports of dual-use items is based on preventive measures, such as imposing export licensing requirements and customs registration procedures."
"Export controls have a considerable impact on EU trade policy as they can affect more than 10% of all EU exports."
"in writing. - (IT) Export controls of dual-use items, meaning goods which can be used for both civil and military purposes, have been the subject of EU-level actions for around 15 years."
"These controls have a high impact on European trade policy, since they can affect over 10% of all EU exports."
"In my opinion, the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and its clarification of the EU's competencies in the area of international trade provide an invaluable opportunity to reaffirm the role of the Union and the European Parliament's responsibility within the EU's institutional framework for decision making."
"The main export control tool is Regulation (CE) No 428/2009, which introduced a number of significant changes to the scope of dual-use export controls -use items in the European Union."
"I believe, specifically, that the EU regime relating to dual-use items should be organised in a more transparent way."
"To this end, I agree with the rapporteur's belief that full European Parliament involvement, through the application of the Treaty of Lisbon's obligations and its joint interpretation agreed by Parliament and the Commission within the new Framework Agreement, would be crucial."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr Leichtfried's report deals in a positive way with the important subject of the control of EU exports of dual-use items, meaning goods which can be used for both civil and military purposes."
"Control over this kind of export, which affects more than 10% of all EU exports, has proved to be of the utmost importance for the non-proliferation of armaments."
"I am voting in favour of the report because it aims to introduce more transparent control procedures for the aforementioned exports."
"I voted for the proposal for amending the regulation as I think that the new points introduced will result in making the EU's dual-use regime more transparent and democratic."
"This means that the European Parliament will be able to participate in updating the lists featuring the products to be controlled by the international regimes."
"These lists are currently transposed almost automatically into EU legislation without Parliament having any say."
"Furthermore, it is the Dual-Use Coordination Group's job to submit an annual report to Parliament so that the latter is fully informed about the progress on controlling products and technologies which can be used for both civil and military purposes."
"Dual-use items are products which are liable to have both civil and military uses, such as chemical products and technical construction material, as well as software and other new technologies."
"It is often difficult to predict the true purpose of exported products; therefore exporters must be made aware of their responsibilities and be obliged to verify the true purpose of the various products they sell abroad."
"Even though several control and information mechanisms already exist, we have called for heightened security in this area."
"That is why we voted in favour of the amendments calling for prior notification of exports, stricter controls and greater transparency."
"This will provide an additional safeguard to prevent misuse and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"Products, including software and technologies, that can be used for both civil and military purposes are considered dual-use technology products."
"This dual use means particular care is needed with regard to their export, to prevent the proliferation of weapons and, above all, of weapons of mass destruction."
"As is clear to any analyst, it is essential for international security that there be control of these products, and that the regulations establishing the relevant control mechanisms be constantly updated in line with technological developments."
"It is also clear that, in states under the rule of law, these controls should be transparent and democratic, as is the Commission's intention."
"Finally, I believe, as stated in the Opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, that the Commission needs to be sensitive to the fact that some EU Member States have more restrictive and stringent rules with regard to control of exports of dual-use products."
"This is natural and, in my opinion, should be maintained."
"This report is on the need to control the export and circulation of what are called dual-use products: that is, those that have not only a civil but also a military one."
"Over the last few years, the European Union has been taking a number of measures to prevent these materials being used for the manufacture of weapons, particularly weapons of mass destruction."
"The EU's main instrument of control is Regulation (EC) No 428/2009, of 5 May, which covers the sale and transportation of these materials, but which needs to be amended in order to prevent different approaches being taken in different Member States."
"I therefore agree with the proposals included in this report, as they aim to reassure the European public with regard to the production and circulation of dual-use materials, and to make the current arrangements more transparent and democratic."
"Export controls on dual-use products are the subject of measures at EU level."
"The main instrument for controlling exports is Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 2009."
"This regulation expanded the scope of controls on sale and transportation."
"Although there is an attempt in the report to introduce increased democratic controls and transparency, there are certain key issues preventing us from voting in favour of it."
"Following its creation, the 'list of exporters, brokers and stakeholders that have been consulted' is the responsibility of the Dual-Use Coordination Group, chaired by a representative of the Commission."
"It will be this group that decides which countries may be traded with, removing this power from Member States, thus calling their sovereignty into question."
"Another aspect is the inclusion of Israel on the list of destination countries for dual-use products."
"Let us recall, for example, the joint research projects financed by the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, especially those that took place with the participation of Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd., manufacturer of the unmanned aircraft used in the attack on the Gaza Strip in 2008/2009, causing the deaths of dozens of people."
"We voted in favour of returning this report to the relevant parliamentary committee, to enable negotiations with the Council to continue, on the basis of the legislative proposal with the amendments introduced by Parliament."
"We know that the use of civil products and technologies for military purposes lacks an approach that is not tied up with controlling exports of what are known as dual-use products and related services."
"Although this control of exports is important, and should be carried out in a judicious manner, without adversely affecting access by developing countries to products and technologies required for their development, there is a need to increase the transparency of the processes involved, and to open them up to democratic scrutiny."
"We would emphasise that there is also a need for consistency in this area between other EU policies and the objectives of this Regulation."
"The joint research projects financed by the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, especially those that took place with the participation of Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd., manufacturer of the unmanned aircraft used in the attack on the Gaza Strip in 2008/2009, causing the deaths of dozens of people, are well known."
"in writing. - (IT) The EU's new competencies in the area of international trade following the Treaty of Lisbon provide a good occasion for bringing greater transparency to the market for dual-use items."
"The changes to this Regulation, which affect items which can be put to both military and civil use, will enable closer controls on this kind of item."
"This is crucial in avoiding the proliferation of weapons."
"Taking into account furthermore the procedure in committee, I confirm my support for my fellow Member."
"in writing. - (LT) Chemical and radioactive materials, centrifuges, technical equipment, software and components are used not just for civil, but also military purposes."
"In the wrong hands these goods may become torture equipment or weapons of mass destruction."
"I voted in favour of this document, because it proposes improving the regime for the control of exports of dual-use items and technology, in other words, enhancing export checks on dual-use goods."
"This document also extends the list of goods for which a licence must be obtained and export movement must be reported."
"in writing. - (DE) Items and technology with civil and potential military uses should be subject to the same competitive conditions in all Member States."
"The point is to find common and, above all, secure framework conditions that ensure safe usage."
"This should prevent an artificial reduction in the sale prices of European exports, clearly strengthening European small and medium-sized businesses."
"I voted in favour of the proposed amendment to the regulation because transparency and safety must be the top priority for such items and technology."
"in writing. - I welcome this report."
"Export controls of dual-use items, meaning goods which can be used for both civil and military purposes, have been the subject of EU-level actions for around 15 years."
"Controlling the export of dual-use goods is a key for the non-proliferation of arms, including weapons of mass destruction."
"Given the high volume of trade across the borders of the European Union, the enforcement of EU export controls on dual-use goods relies on preventive measures such as the imposition of export licensing requirements and customs registration procedures."
"Export controls have a high impact on the EU's trade policy as they can affect more than 10% of all EU exports."
"The main EU export control tool is the Dual-use Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009, which entered into force on 27 August 2009."
"This new Regulation introduced a number of significant changes to the scope of dual-use export controls in the European Union."
"These include the introduction of controls on brokering activities and transit with regard to dual-use items."
"The Dual-use Regulation includes regularly updated lists of controlled dual-use items that reflect those of the main international export control regimes."
"in writing. - (CS) Controlling the trade in dual-use goods is an important area, with both security and commercial aspects that would not be sufficiently effective and enforceable without the associated flow of shared information or flexible international cooperation."
"In this context, I would also like to emphasise the role of the relevant monitoring bodies, for example customs authorities, which shoulder considerable responsibility for the direct monitoring of exports or transit of dual-use goods."
"In my opinion, we should also assist these bodies, for example in the area of access to modern monitoring equipment, the acquisition of new expertise in the performance of monitoring procedures and, last but not least, through support for professional training and work exchange visits."
"A sophisticated security policy should always include setting up the export regime for dual-use goods to a high standard, along with the application of all international commitments."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and its clarification of the EU's competences in the area of international trade provide a good occasion to reaffirm the EU's role in this area and the European Parliament's role, power and responsibility for decision-making within the EU's institutional framework."
"The EU's dual-use regime should be organised in a more transparent and democratic way."
"Full European Parliament involvement, through the application of the Treaty of Lisbon's obligations and its joint interpretation agreed by the European Parliament and the European Commission within the new framework agreement, would be crucial to achieving this objective."
"in writing. - Dual-use items are products which can be used either for peaceful or for military purposes."
"Control over the export of dual-use items is a key aspect of non-proliferation of arms."
"Having regard to high volumes of trade across the EU border, application of EU control over exports of dual-use items is based on preventive measures."
"Control of exports has a large impact on EU trade policy."
"It would be nice if instruments of control do not become a means of fighting against competitors through business structures."
"To this end, it is necessary to create a long list of dual-use items; however it is a topic for another report."
"I voted 'for'."
"in writing. - (DE) The export of dual-use items and technology is very carefully regulated within the EU."
"This term particularly relates to items and technology that can also be put to military use."
"In order to prevent abuses in the export sector, there are four types of export authorisations: the Community General Export Authorisations, National General Export Authorisations, Global Export Authorisations and Individual Export Authorisations."
"Each of these applies within the EU."
"In addition, there are also international export control regimes to which the EU subscribes and in which the Commission attempts to improve the standing of the EU."
"These include the Australia Group, of which the Commission is a full member and which includes each of the 27 Member States and the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea and Australia, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, in which the Commission has observer status, and which includes the EU 27, the US and Russia, the Wassenaar Arrangement, in which the Commission has no status, but which includes all EU Member States except Cyprus as full members, and the Missile Technology Control Regime, in which the Commission also has no status and of which only 19 Member States are full members."
"I have voted accordingly, so as not to go against the principle of subsidiarity."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report as in a limited way it takes a step in the direction of tackling the current lack of transparency in relation to export credits and in tackling the massive gap between the stated objectives of the EU and the reality of how export credits are used in the EU."
"The EU likes to portray itself as a force for human rights and environmental protection."
"The role of European ECAs demonstrates the hollowness of this claim."
"These credits are regularly used to back projects and trade that are destructive to the environment and workers' rights."
"To achieve real trade justice in this area, these agencies, which support approximately 10% of world trade, must be taken into democratic public ownership."
"The books must be opened up so that the workers and those affected by them can see for the first time where the money has gone and workers' control must be exercised on the operation of these agencies so that their massive resources are used for the benefit of working people, small farmers and the environment."
"I voted in favour of this report, as I believe that the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and its clarification of the EU's competences in the area of international trade provide a good occasion to reaffirm the EU's role in this area and the European Parliament's role, power and responsibility for decision-making within the EU's institutional framework."
"The EU's dual-use regime should be organised in a more transparent and democratic way."
"Full European Parliament involvement, through the application of the Treaty of Lisbon's obligations and its joint interpretation agreed by the European Parliament and the European Commission within the new framework agreement, would be crucial to achieving this objective."
"It is a recasting of Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 in the light of the current international framework."
"In fact, the widening of the scope of dual-use export controls is essential if these are to cover controls on transit and brokering, and the penalising of illicit brokering of dual-use items linked to, for example, a weapons of mass destruction programme."
"in writing. - (IT) The proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000 setting up a Community regime for the control mechanism of exports of dual-use items and technology, as tabled on 7 February 2011, aims to supply the Union with an efficient regime of preventive measures designed to prevent the proliferation of weapons, including weapons of mass destruction."
"TheRegulation that is currently in force in this area ((EC) No 428/2009) establishes a system of checks which allows the Union to comply fully with the commitments assumed in the context of the four international export control regimes to which the EU is a party."
"In any case, the clarification of the EU's competencies in the area of international trade introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon provides a good occasion to raise the profile and improve the image of the Union in an international context and the role, power and responsibility of the European Parliament within the EU's institutional framework for decision making in the area of international trade."
"These are my reasons for considering it opportune to make the necessary amendments to the Regulation in order to achieve these ends and I am therefore voting in favour of the proposal."
"in writing. - In AFET/SEDE, as green MEP as rapporteur, we were very successful."
"The AFET/SEDE opinion proposed to delete the Low Value Shipments CGEA because we were provided with good data proving that there is no positive correlation between a low price and a low security risk, an assumption on which the whole CGEA relied."
"On the contrary, some very cheap dual use items might be of great risk if they get into the wrong hands."
"We were also able to delete the part on 'Information Security' of EU007 because among the possible destinations were some non-democratic countries."
"We also managed to get a broad support in AFET/SEDE for strong wording on the need to respect human rights when in comes to the export of telecommunication equipment because interception technologies, digital data transfer devices for monitoring mobiles phones, etc. are part of this CGEA."
"With regard to possible destinations of individual CGEAs we managed to exclude both Israel and India because of their unwillingness to become a State Party to the Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT)."
"But the most contentious and important issue was the question of whether it is sufficient to control, notify and register after the export has taken place or prior to the export."
"in writing. - (IT) The control of exports of dual-use items, that is goods which can be used for both civil and military purposes, has been the subject of EU-level actions for around 15 years."
"This type of control is crucial in the fight against the proliferation of arms, including weapons of mass destruction."
"Given the high volume of trade across the borders of the European Union, the enforcement of EU export controls on dual-use goods must rely on preventive measures such as the imposition of export licensing requirements and customs registration procedures."
"The approval of this resolution represents a further step in this direction."
"I voted in favour of this report, because the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon offers a good occasion to reaffirm Europe's role and the power and responsibilities of the European Parliament within the EU's institutional framework for decision making of this kind. The regime must be reorganised in a more transparent way, through the application of the obligations in the Treaty and its joint interpretation agreed by Parliament and the Commission within the new Framework Agreement."
"in writing. - (NL) The control of exports of dual-use items - in other words goods that can be used for both civil and military purposes - is very important in relation to the non-proliferation of weapons."
"The European Parliament's position carries the achievements of the Treaty of Lisbon into EU legislation, and rightly so."
"Parliament also reinforces democratic control and transparency and raises the profile of the EU in relation to international export control regimes."
"It is also positive that the Commission is obliged to produce reports on the functioning of the Regulation, together with a comprehensive impact assessment."
"However, the trickiest bone of contention between the Council, Parliament and the Commission in all this remains the question of when the control of notification and registration of the export takes place, whether before or after the actual export."
"As far as I am concerned, it is crucial that this control should take place before the export is effected."
"This is because, in practice, ex-post control will always result in us having to hunt around for the facts after the event."
"Parliament has just decided to opt for ex-post controls."
"In the end, I therefore voted against the final version of this report."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution on officially supported export credits."
"Export credits are an important instrument for supporting EU enterprises."
"I agree with the opinion that support for medium and long-term export credits is a powerful tool which is not yet fully exploited in all Member States and needs to be encouraged."
"Export credits can help to create jobs by securing financing for projects which otherwise would have more restricted access to capital due to their non-market character."
"Nevertheless, it should be observed that currently there is insufficient transparency to find out what export credit agencies (ECAs) finance or have financed in the past."
"The lack of transparency leads to huge cost and time overruns, and it also facilitates bribery and corruption."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur's proposal to establish a requirement for the EU Member States to report to the Commission annually on the activities of their ECAs as regards risk calculations and the disclosure of off-balance sheet vehicles, and to make the notification of social and environmental risk calculations mandatory."
"in writing. - (LT) Most industrialised countries, including all EU Member States, have at least one officially supported Export Credit Agency (ECA), and these collectively account for the world's largest source of official financing for private-sector projects."
"The collective magnitude of the export credit guarantees provided in the period 2004-2009 by the ECAs of the EU Member States alone was in the range of EUR 468 billion."
"ECAs facilitate legitimate trade where the private capital market fails."
"They have a much higher risk-absorbing capacity than private actors, since they do not have to pay taxes and make profit, and hence have more lee-way to break even on an extended credit than private banks."
"However, for the same reason ECAs are also potentially a massive distortion of trade, if their financing operations are not disciplined by common rules."
"Although ECAs are an important instrument to support trade and investments of European companies, it is necessary to ensure that their operations are financially sound, and they do not need to turn to the tax payer for re-financing their operations."
"I agreed with the report and the requirement to submit annual reports to the European Commission and the European Parliament, because currently there is very little data showing what ECAs finance or have financed in the past, and some national ECAs do not even report the overall balance of their annual operations regularly, which violates the principles of transparency."
"in writing. - (IT) The aim of the European Commission's proposal is to introduce the 'Arrangement on officially supported export credits' as negotiated by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) into European legislation so as to ensure EU norms and transparency in the operations of national export credit agencies."
"This measure, already a positive step in itself because it tackles corruption and the lack of transparency which results in huge cost and time overruns, is improved by the Jadot Report, which seeks to further improve transparency and justice by introducing the Arrangement agreed within the OECD into EU legislation."
"Export credit agencies (ECAs) account for the world's largest source of official financing for private-sector projects."
"They are government agencies or quasi-official financial institutions that provide export credits, loans, insurance and investment guarantees for companies operating in high-risk areas abroad, including many developing countries."
"It should be noted that financing of such major projects in developing countries represents several times the combined annual funding of all multilateral development banks."
"ECAs are therefore instruments that are well placed to contribute to EU foreign policy objectives, in particular the alleviation of poverty and climate change."
"I believe the improvements to the agreement in question to be positive, particularly with regard to greater transparency, and I believe it essential to state explicitly that ECAs should take into account and respect EU policies and objectives, not least values associated with the consolidation of democracy, respect for human rights and consistency with development policy."
"While, on the one hand, ECAs facilitate trade, they could, on the other, cause it to be distorted in the absence of clear and transparent criteria and rules."
"in writing. - (IT) Foreign trade is one of the most powerful political tools we have available in our dealings with third countries."
"At least until it becomes necessary to decide otherwise, the EU has chosen not to have its own army and to adopt trade policy as its main negotiating tool in international relations, and in this respect it has not been without success."
"Direct foreign investment in our businesses, furthermore, represents a source of development for third countries in which work is created and it is certainly worthwhile encouraging these links through export credit agencies."
"What we can no longer allow, in an internal market with single customs duties, is that investment can be steered by individual Member States."
"This does not belong on the path created by the EU that it tries to present to the rest of the world."
"The transfer of all competencies relating to international trade from the level of the States to that of the Union is a further step in the establishment of a single industrial policy, with a view to a common economic policy and, on the horizon, further synergies between our States."
"The activities of Export Credit Agencies will need to be better supervised at European level and conducted in a more transparent manner."
"These agencies will be required to publish an annual activity report in order to verify whether the supported projects fulfil the European Union's environmental, social and development objectives."
"MEPs have called for fossil fuel subsidies to be phased out in order to encourage the ecological transition, in line with national and European commitments on combating climate change."
"Through this vote, Parliament is reaffirming its desire to see the systematic application of financial transparency measures and measures to incorporate the climate change issue in all EU policies, including those in relation to trade and investments of European companies."
"I voted in favour of the report on officially supported export credits, as I believe that officially supported export credit agencies need to be more transparent and report on their activities."
"It is also important to ensure complete consistency with the objectives of Article 208 of the Treaty, which establishes the reduction and eradication of poverty as the main objectives of the Union's development cooperation policy."
"The Commission and Council are currently reviewing the legislative framework - called the 'Arrangement on officially supported export credits' - to transfer it into EU law."
"The purpose is to provide additional legal certainty for the export credit agencies (ECAs) of the Member States."
"Export credits are effective instruments for supporting EU companies, as they are able to help with job creation and the implementation of projects that would otherwise have difficulties securing financing."
"The fact that ever more applications are being received would suggest that the Member States need to introduce the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Arrangement quickly."
"I agree with the Opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as I believe that 'European level supervision of export credits should be introduced as an exception when a distortion of competition within the internal market occurs."
"The principle of subsidiarity must be upheld.'"
"This report is on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of certain rules to the obtaining of export credits by officially supported companies."
"In reality, the majority of Member States have export credit agencies (ECAs), which play an essential role in supporting European trade and business investment, totalling EUR 468 billion in 2004-2009."
"This support comes under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) - also called the Agreement - negotiated between the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and it is an example of a public finance instrument with European Union involvement."
"Given that these agencies essentially support environmentally harmful industrial activities, not least because of CO2 emissions, and that, according to the World Bank, they have an insignificant effect on poverty reduction, I agree with the rapporteur's position that ECAs should contribute to EU policies and objectives, meaning there is no need for the OECD Agreement to be reviewed."
"We believe there is a need for greater supervision and control of export credit agencies (ECAs), with regard both to exports, and to investments and finance, as their lack of transparency causes immense harm by encouraging bribery and corruption."
"ECAs are public instruments that are used a great deal by the EU to contribute to financing its international objectives, and economic and geostrategic interests, which cannot be separated from objectives of dominating and controlling regions and countries, leading to the creation of veritable neocolonial relationships."
"Investments financed by ECAs frequently bring no benefit to the countries that are their supposed beneficiaries."
"The drawing up of guidelines for export credits is aimed at getting around the announced end to direct aid within the framework of World Trade Organisation agreements, which is pressurising developing countries to accept the signing of the Doha Round."
"The main objective of direct aid or credit continues to be the control of markets and natural resources, the exploitation of workers, and the use of products or investments to control the sovereignty of destination countries that are made possible by ECA financing."
"There is a need for greater supervision and control of export credit agencies (ECAs), with regard both to exports, and to investments and finance, as their lack of transparency causes immense harm by encouraging bribery and corruption."
"However, ECAs are public instruments that are used a great deal by the EU to contribute to the financing of its international objectives, particularly with regard to climate change and the alleviation of poverty."
"Sometimes it is used as a means of financing instances of veritable EU neocolonialism in so-called developing countries."
"The drawing up of guidelines for export credits is aimed at getting around the announced end to direct aid within the framework of World Trade Organisation agreements, which is pressurising developing countries to accept the signing of the Doha Round and is contested by them."
"The main objective of direct aid or credit continues to be the control of markets and natural resources, the exploitation of workers, and the use of products or investments to control the sovereignty of destination countries that are made possible by ECA financing."
"It would be wrong if officially supported export credits failed to respect certain principles, in particular certain social ethics, and to comply with the guidelines on external and development aid policy."
"Transparency regarding the use of these funds is therefore compulsory."
"However, it is the external policy conducted by the Union that serves as a reference, and that policy has proved, especially in recent months, to be non-existent, inconsistent and divergent, to say the least."
"The Union itself does not respect the principles that it lays down: when did we last see the Commission actually apply the social, human rights and environmental clauses that it scatters throughout its trade agreements?"
"When has it ever objected to the European Investment Bank financing projects outside of Europe which create unfair competition for European businesses, or which are socially and environmentally questionable?"
"Moreover, the aim of this report is the transposition into European law of an arrangement negotiated within the globalist and ultra-liberal organisation, the OECD."
"That arrangement de facto permits European businesses to be handicapped in relation to their competitors, particularly those from China."
"When it came to voting either for or against, we abstained."
"in writing. - (LT) As is known, it is impossible to find out what export credit agencies (ECAs) finance or have financed in the past."
"Some national ECAs do not even report the overall balance of their annual operations regularly."
"Many others do not report disaggregated data of their sectoral lending or the geographical distribution."
"This is in spite of transparency requirements in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Arrangement of 2005, which all EU Member States adhere to, and which shall now be transferred into EU law."
"The OECD Arrangement does not contain the requirements needed to guarantee the fair pricing of premiums since it entails no disciplines with regard to transparency and minimum standards in the application of social and environmental risk calculations."
"There are proposals to tidy up transparency requirements on risk calculations, disclose off-balance sheet vehicles, make the notification of social and environmental risk calculations mandatory and to establish a requirement for the EU Member States to annually report to the Commission on the activities of their ECAs in these regards."
"I therefore voted in favour of this document, because it will introduce more transparency and standards in the application of social and environmental risk calculations."
"in writing. - (LV) I supported the resolution for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of certain guidelines in the field of officially supported export credits, because I consider that clear rules are needed for all European Union Member States on how to support exporting businesses."
"Export credit guarantees are an important means of helping entrepreneurs to acquire new markets and create new jobs."
"However, I did not support Amendment 22, which imposes an extra burden on entrepreneurs and makes European businesses less competitive than entrepreneurs in other member states of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)."
"In a time of crisis, European Union Member States must reduce the administrative burden on entrepreneurs, not create a new one."
"In this field, the European Parliament must set an example, and not seek fresh reasons for imposing an extra burden on entrepreneurs."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"I view export credits as an important instrument for supporting EU enterprises."
"In light of the increased demand for officially supported export credits, it is of the utmost importance that the newest OECD regulation of this instrument is introduced in Member States as soon as possible."
"Support for medium- and long-term export credits is a powerful tool which is not yet fully exploited in all Member States and needs to be encouraged."
"Export credits can help to create jobs by securing financing for projects which otherwise would have more restricted access to capital due to their non-market character."
"I agree with the rapporteur, who notes that any new legislation in this field must avoid the creation of any new red tape or bureaucracy which would add to already existing costs."
"European-level supervision of export credits should be introduced as an exception when a distortion of competition within the internal market occurs."
"The principle of subsidiarity must be upheld."
"This report calls for the granting of officially supported credits and guarantees for private sector exports to be supplemented by 'social and environmental impact assessments'."
"It also calls for the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets to remain unaffected by these projects."
"That is a minimum."
"I shall vote against the report, however, to express my bitter regret that the Committee on International Trade is not seeking to give itself the means to keep to social and environmental targets worthy of the name."
"Free competition, the fight against protectionism and obstacles to the denunciation of agricultural export subsidies are some of the many absurdities endorsed by this text."
"Export credit agencies (ECAs) have been playing an increasingly important role in supporting all types of investments, thus contributing to reducing the impact of the current economic and financial crisis by creating jobs, and by supporting the trade and investment of companies that would otherwise not be granted credit in the private sector."
"ECAs have become the major source of public finance for developing countries."
"A significant proportion of export credit financing projects in developing countries are concentrated in sectors such as transport, petroleum, gas and extractive industries, as well as in major infrastructure projects, such as large dams, for example."
"However, it is important that ECAs' activities be closely supervised, so as to prevent future problems."
"in writing. - The EU is a participant in the Agreement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits concluded in the framework of the OECD."
"It will be correct if the European Parliament adopts amendments to the proposal of the Commission intended to apply additional measures for transparency and accountability of reports in the European Union."
"in writing. - (DE) Public and officially supported export credit agencies are important backers for private business projects in developing countries."
"In these times of overstretched national budgets they are gaining increasing importance as sources of investment for European businesses, insofar as these are not required to refinance themselves with taxpayers' money."
"Because the risk assessment criteria for public export credit agencies are quite different from those when the loan comes from a private bank, competition can be distorted in international trade, as the Chinese example illustrates."
"That is why a whole host of regulations exist, such as OECD and WTO agreements, which fix the deadlines for repayment and a minimum premium rate."
"For the purposes of evaluation and in order to prevent abuse and to avoid refinancing from taxpayers' money, specifications are required for greater transparency through an EU-wide obligation to publish annual reports, etc. It is open to question whether the proposed measures will bring about greater transparency."
"I have therefore abstained from voting."
"I voted in favour of this report, as I agree with the rapporteur that export credit constitutes a powerful instrument for supporting EU companies."
"Given the growing number of applications for export credit with official support, it is increasingly important that the most recent Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Agreement on this instrument be introduced by Member States as quickly as possible."
"Medium- and long-term export credit is a valuable instrument which is not yet fully exploited in all Member States and needs to be encouraged, especially in a weakened economy like that of Portugal."
"Export credit certainly acts as an engine for job creation, by securing financing for projects which otherwise would have more restricted access to capital."
"Any legislation in this field must avoid the creation of any and all new administrative bureaucracy, which could add to already existing costs."
"European-level supervision of export credits should only be introduced as an exception when some distortion of competition within the Internal Market could occur."
"The principle of subsidiarity must be scrupulously upheld in this area."
"in writing. - (IT) Export credit agencies (ECAs) represent the world's largest source of official financing for private-sector projects."
"However, they can also create a massive distortion of trade if their financing operations are not disciplined by common rules."
"Therefore we should go ahead with a revision to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) agreement (the Arrangement on officially supported export credits) so that we can monitor more carefully the functioning of the European ECAs so as to ensure that their decisions are coherent with EU policies and objectives."
"We also need to clarify the obligation of transparency in risk calculations and on the disclosure of off-balance-sheet vehicles."
"In short, it is vital to establish a requirement for the EU Member States to report annually to the Commission on the activities of their ECAs in this regard."
"In the light of the previous observations, and given that ECAs can be useful instruments to contribute to the Union's external objectives (especially climate change and tpoverty alleviation), I am voting in favour of this resolution since I believe that export credits are an important instrument to support trade and investments of European companies."
"As the rapporteur Mr°Jadot said, today's vote strengthens the European Parliament's position on the issue and sends out a strong signal to an overly timid European Council."
"Export Credit Agencies are an important instrument for the European Union in terms of supporting trade and investments of European companies."
"However, there was an urgent need to tackle the lack of transparency and EU supervision - particularly by Parliament - surrounding the activities of these agencies, particularly given that several hundreds of millions of euros are channelled though them every year, and that national budgets are subject to severe constraints."
"I too am delighted that MEPs have once again declared their support for the phasing-out of fossil fuel subsidies and are thus encouraging the ecological transition, in line with European and national commitments on climate change."
"in writing. - (IT) Most industrialised countries have an export credit agency."
"These agencies collectively account for the world's largest source of official financing for private-sector projects."
"Export credit agencies' underwriting of large industrial and infrastructure projects in developing countries tops several times the combined annual funding of all Multilateral Development Banks."
"The agencies facilitate legitimate trade where the private capital market fails."
"They have a much higher risk-absorbing capacity than private actors, since they do not have to pay taxes and make a profit, and hence have more leeway than private banks to break even, even on an extended credit."
"However, for the same reason, they are also potentially a massive distortion of trade, if their financing operations are not disciplined by common rules."
"I voted in favour of this report because export credits should be subjected to repayment requirements within a certain time limit and that a minimum premium rate should be charged to cover the risk of non-payment."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this important resolution on a new EU policy framework to fight violence against women."
"Violence against women is an international as well as a European problem."
"Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of debate for several decades, the international community has not managed to put an end to this extremely destructive form of criminality."
"It is therefore very important to make every effort at EU level to reduce violence against women as much as possible and create the conditions to prevent it, to prosecute criminals and protect victims."
"To achieve these objectives it is necessary to harmonise criminal law at EU level, and put in place a legal framework, under which offenders would be effectively punished and victims protected."
"This is also very important for combating trafficking in human beings."
"Forced marriage is another form of gender-based violence, which constitutes a serious violation of the individual's right to freedom and self-determination."
"It is important for young women to be protected against such forced relationships."
"Honour-related violence is a key concept in this context."
"In order to stop all forms of violence against women, it is necessary to disseminate information on gender equality, and to actively inform society, particularly those layers where relations between women and men are based on traditions and rituals."
"in writing. - (IT) In Europe, one woman in four is a victim of at least some form of violence during her lifetime."
"The annual cost of this violence is estimated to be in the region of EUR 33 billion, a figure that should not be underestimated."
"Respect for the principle of gender equality is a value which is consistently disregarded in the face of a vast range of human rights violations affecting women, which damage their physical and mental health, their rights and their position in society."
"The few figures currently availably do not provide a complete view of the phenomenon, but it is sufficient to observe familial or work contexts to see that we have still not managed to protect women from violence."
"I support the commitment taken by the Commission to present in 2011-2012, the 'Communication on a strategy to combat violence against women, domestic violence and female genital mutilation', to be followed up by an EU action plan, but I also hope we will see the adoption of a comprehensive policy approach, comprised of legal, judicial, executive and health actions, which can effectively reduce this kind of violence and the consequences which it unfortunately has on the 26% of children and young people who report having experienced physical violence in childhood."
"The official figures on violence against women are much lower compared to the sad reality in each Member State."
"Officially, between 2004 and 2009, approximately 60 000 cases of domestic violence were recorded, with almost 800 cases resulting in the victim's death."
"Out of all the women abused, 70% put up with the abuse in silence and only 30% decide to make a complaint to the police."
"In this context, I support the provision of easy access to free legal aid for victims of violence against women."
"I think that declaring a European Year of Combating Violence Against Women has the potential to raise awareness among Europeans about this problem which features in the everyday lives of a significant number of women in the European Union."
"I voted for this report as I support the importance of a European charter which will set out a minimum level of assistance services to be offered to victims of violence against women, with the aim of reducing the incidence of this problem in all Member States."
"This own-initiative report was drafted within the framework of the various proposals that the European Commission will announce in 2011 and 2012 on fighting violence against women."
"This is a particularly important topic for me, as well as for the Femmes au Centre (Women at the Centre) Association, which held a conference on the topic a few weeks ago in Paris."
"The report proposes a new comprehensive policy approach against gender-based violence, including, in particular, the establishment of a European charter setting out a minimum level of assistance services for victims and a Europe-wide criminal-law instrument."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The international community must implement a cross-border approach to combat violence against women."
"There is no doubt that violence against women violates their basic rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the right to security and human dignity."
"Member States must implement CEDAW (UN Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women), which aims to ensure the rights and freedoms of women."
"Under the Treaty of Lisbon the EU can introduce criminal law provisions, and the Treaty makes particular reference to human trafficking and to the sexual exploitation of children and women."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe it is time that the EU faced this issue and gave good example by means of the legislation and support required to bring an end to violence against women."
"A multi-faceted approach must be adopted to ensure the effectiveness of the political, social and legal measures being applied."
"in writing. - (LT) Violence against women in its various forms remains a major international as well as a European problem."
"In the EU it is important for women's integrity to be comprehensively and consistently protected in law."
"Some countries still do not have a law criminalising domestic violence against women."
"Domestic violence must not be treated as a private matter."
"The Member States must ensure that legal authorities make the prosecution of acts of domestic violence a priority, and that the perpetrators of such violations are prosecuted."
"I voted in favour of this report, which expresses the European Parliament's clear position."
"We encourage the Commission to fight violence against women."
"Of course, there are preventive and repressive legal mechanisms in all the Member States."
"However, it is also the responsibility of Europe to take up this issue, which falls within its remit."
"It is not acceptable for women to be subjected to bullying and physical or psychological violence on a daily basis."
"I voted for this report because violence against women is both a global and European problem."
"This report presents a package of measures which are absolutely necessary to guarantee women in Europe a decent life."
"It is of fundamental importance that women's integrity is comprehensively and consistently protected by law."
"When legislating at EU level, it is absolutely imperative to be aware of the extreme vulnerability which women and children experience in relation to domestic violence."
"However, it is not enough to introduce or approve a series of criminal laws for the protection of women; criminal prosecution must also be made more effective."
"A key area where more resources could be input is the training of police authorities in Europe."
"The police are the first law enforcement agency with which women who have fallen victim to violence come into contact. One practical measure which can be taken is to set up an emergency number for gender-based violence in Member States."
"Women subjected to violence could call this number to obtain immediate assistance."
"in writing. - (IT) Equality between the sexes is one of the fundamental principles of the European Union."
"Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of debate for decades, the international community has not yet managed to put an end to this serious form of criminality."
"Gender-based violence results in serious damage to individuals' physical and mental health, whilst this entails increased costs for society in the form of social problems and costs for the legal and healthcare systems."
"It is estimated that the cost to society of gender-based violence, in the form of spending on healthcare, the legal system and social services, is EUR 2 million per hour in total in all EU Member States."
"In my opinion, an important area in which women's physical and mental integrity requires strong legal protection is in relation to genital mutilation."
"I believe, in fact, that acts which result in serious harm to women's health cannot be legitimised through cultural considerations."
"Furthermore, more knowledge as to the extent of gender-based violence in Europe is essential, so that public awareness of this problem can be enhanced."
"I am therefore in favour of actions taken to encourage Member States to draw up national action plans to combat gender-based violence."
"in writing. - (BG) This report on the priorities and outline of a new EU policy framework to fight violence against women puts forward numerous interesting proposals."
"This is why I supported it."
"However, in my view, it must not be in any way a directive that every Member State should be obliged to transpose into their own legislation."
"The mechanisms facilitating access to legal aid, enabling victims to assert their rights anywhere in the European Union must not and cannot be provided free of charge."
"I am in favour of establishing a legal framework that gives immigrant women the right to hold their own passport and residence permit, and makes it possible to hold a person criminally responsible for taking these documents away."
"in writing. -- (IT) These days, I would expect that a report into violence against women would highlight the absolute emergency represented by the increasing levels of violence against women in the Muslim communities of Europe."
"European women's rights and gender violence organisations report that this phenomenon continues to grow."
"This is something that takes place right under our noses, but it seems there is a certain reluctance to talk about the problem using the correct terms."
"The report mentions, for example, forced marriages and female genital mutilation, but these phenomena, which are growing exponentially in our cities, are tackled as if they are issues related to cultural background."
"The truth is that they are linked to the massive presence of immigrants who bring to Europe a fundamentalist conception of religion, Islam, and while today it is women in these communities who are paying the price, tomorrow it could affect our women and the very core of western society."
"The EU should immediately put in place adequate and targeted policies on this subject, and not on violence related to 'cultural' backgrounds, which means nothing, so that we can fight this strongly spreading phenomenon today, which at this pace will become impossible to manage tomorrow."
"I voted in favour of this report, because it is necessary to stop violence against women as a matter of urgency."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that one in ten women in Europe has experienced violence and it is one of the most frequent causes of violent death among women."
"Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of debate for several decades, it pains me to see that we are still unable to protect women from violence."
"It is therefore very important for the European Commission to draw up a single directive on all forms of violence against women - physical, sexual or psychological - and on combating it."
"Gender-based violence covers sexual abuse, human trafficking, forced marriage, genital mutilation and other forms of violations."
"Such violent crimes have a major impact on and do irreparable damage to a woman's physical and mental health, and therefore the Member States should ensure better healthcare for the victims of violence."
"Furthermore, I would like to urge the Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilią Malmström not to reduce the financial assistance allocated to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) combating violence against women."
"Even more acts of violence are taking place during the economic and financial crisis, therefore under no circumstances can we reduce financing in this area."
"The European Parliament has adopted in the past a resolution on violence against women, which emphasised the need for comprehensive legislation which would combat every form of violence against women."
"The Commission has made some important decisions in principle towards this end, especially by drawing up a new action plan for gender equality, which stresses that gender-based violence is one of the key problems to be addressed."
"The Commission has also announced that it will submit a proposal in 2011 for a strategic plan to combat gender-based violence."
"Gender-based violence results in severe harm to individuals' physical and mental health."
"This entails a heavy cost to society in the form of social problems and costs for the legal and healthcare systems."
"The cost to society of gender-based violence is estimated on the basis of spending on healthcare, the legal system and social services."
"Gender-based violence is also a serious problem in terms of democracy."
"The very fact that women are subjected to violence restricts their opportunities to participate in social and working life."
"As a liberal MEP, I cannot but support this report as Member States need a new strategy for combating violence against women, which has a serious impact on women's physical and mental integrity, regarded as a fundamental right."
"Violence against women has an adverse impact on both the victims and the children who grow up in such an unsuitable environment for their personal development."
"Gender equality is one of the EU's fundamental values which is of particular importance to liberals."
"Modern society, based on equal rights and equality before the law, cannot tolerate such incidents, even when there are cultural or religious reasons to justify them."
"I think that the EU and Member States must use every instrument available to them to combat gender-based violence."
"I support the notion of a directive which will stipulate criminal sanctions for perpetrators of violence against women."
"I think that this must be accompanied by the creation of a sufficient number of victim support centres and by adequate training for those who work with them, such as police officers, judges, doctors and others."
"I am pleased with the concern shown at EU level about violence against women."
"I believe it to be decisive for the success of combating this European and international problem that the Member States take on responsibilities, naturally involving adoption of the necessary legislation."
"I am therefore voting for the new EU policy framework to fight violence against women, as I believe it represents progress in the fight against the violation of fundamental rights and freedoms, such as the right to security and human dignity."
"in writing. - I voted for this report as the situation in Ireland mirrors the problem experienced across Europe."
"The National Crime Council in 2005 found that one in seven women in Ireland experienced severe abusive behaviour of a physical, sexual or emotional nature from a partner at some times in their lives."
"The impact of domestic and physical and/or sexual violence should not be underestimated, as it results in severe damage to individuals' physical and mental health giving rise to severe depression and even suicide."
"However Parliament's report also shows the cost to the exchequer as it is estimated that the cost to society of gender-based violence - in the form of spending on healthcare, the legal system and social services - is EUR 2 million per hour in total in all EU Member States."
"In 2009, I had the privilege in becoming the first ambassador of Rape Crisis North East based in Dundalk."
"This support and counselling service is one of many across Ireland East."
"These NGOs offer vital support for victims of sexual and domestic violence, yet have to cope with a very difficult funding environment."
"I hope this report helps fight domestic violence in Europe."
"I vehemently condemn any form of violence against men, women or children, and I support any initiative enabling this scourge to be anticipated and combated, and its victims to be protected."
"The figures that have come to light in some studies on violence in Europe are unacceptable, with 26% of children and young people having been the target of physical violence, between a fifth and a quarter of the female population having been victim of acts of physical violence at least once during their adult lives, and more than one tenth of them having suffered sexual violence involving the use of force."
"In fact, the number of women who are victims is alarming, and the enormous disparities existing between the policies and legislation of each Member State contribute to that, meaning that women do not enjoy the same level of protection throughout Europe."
"It is crucial that European legislation ensure comprehensive and consistent protection for all women, through the adoption of a comprehensive legal act enabling all forms of violence against women to be combated, supplemented by a series of measures in a number of political, social and legal areas."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Conservatives agree with the report's depiction of the problem."
"In the Stockholm Programme, with regard to which we have been a strong driving force, the fight to combat violence against women is a priority."
"In the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme, the Commission made a commitment to propose a strategy to be presented in 2011-2012 to combat violence against women, domestic violence and female genital mutilation."
"Furthermore, Article 8 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union stipulates that the EU shall make efforts to combat all kinds of domestic violence, and the Member States should take all necessary measures to punish these criminal acts and to protect the victims."
"Since criminal law is the responsibility of the individual Member States, we voted against the paragraph concerning the introduction of a directive at EU level."
"We voted in favour of the report, as we believe that the Member States must take measures to ensure the safety of women."
"in writing. - (RO) I think that, at European level, Member States ought to make additional efforts to compile more comprehensive national statistics which will cover violence against women to a larger extent, regardless of the form in which it occurs - rape, sex trafficking, forced marriages, death, forced prostitution, not to mention violence within the family or from former partners."
"However, the aim is also to improve the collection of data on this problem so that the most appropriate solutions can be found for punishing the culprits."
"I voted in favour of this report as I believe it is important for a society seeking to be more balanced and fairer."
"This phenomenon is present in all societies, in multifaceted form, occurring in the private, public or semi-public spheres, and the related figures and the forms it takes are often unknown."
"I therefore believe, as set out in this report, that thorough analysis is needed, along with the creation of better investigative processes for this phenomenon, in order to combat it better internationally."
"This report suggests a new approach to gender violence, and the strengthening of measures between the Member States with regard to prevention and criminal penalties, together with assistance measures for victims."
"It also asks pertinent questions about the impact of physical, psychological and sexual violence against women in society's various spheres."
"I believe that an active role for the Commission, Parliament and Member States is crucial for the creation of measures to combat this phenomenon, which has implications for a number of people and generations."
"in writing. - Men's violence against women is a violation of women's human rights which both reflects and reinforces inequalities between men and women."
"Studies on gender-based violence estimate that 20-25% of all women in Europe have experienced physical acts of violence at least once during their adult lives."
"Violence against women knows no geographical boundaries, no age limit, no class or race or cultural distinctions, but it is still invisible and the victims are silenced."
"I support this report which proposes a new comprehensive policy approach against gender-based violence including: establishing a criminal-law instrument in the form of a directive against gender-based violence; training for officials likely to come into contact with cases of violence against women; requirements for Member States to demonstrate due diligence and to record and investigate all forms of gender-based crimes of violence; asks for financial support to NGOs working to support victims of violence."
"It also seeks plans to develop methodological guidelines and undertake new data collection efforts to obtain comparable statistical data on gender-based violence in order to identify the extent of the problem and to provide a basis for a change in action towards the problem."
"In Europe, one in four women will experience physical acts of violence within her lifetime and more than one in ten will be a victim of sexual violence involving the use of force."
"Faced with such figures, there is an urgent need to take action."
"The Commission must therefore establish a new European policy framework to fight violence against women."
"All forms of violence against women - rape, prostitution, sexual violence, and so on - must be subject to criminal proceedings in all European Union countries."
"Every Member State has the duty to provide these women victims with access to free legal aid and shelter facilities which will allow them to build a new and better life for themselves and their children."
"This recognition at European level of violence against women as a criminal offence is absolutely crucial."
"The European Parliament adopted a report, this Tuesday 5 April 2011, on fighting violence against women."
"This text emphasises the specific nature of violence against women and girls by men: it is indeed one of the most common and harmful obstacles to gender equality."
"Today's report will make it possible to implement a criminal-law instrument in the form of a European Union directive to combat gender-based violence."
"Indeed, it establishes a European charter, which will ensure a minimum level of assistance, including the right to free legal aid and urgent psychological aid services."
"Furthermore, MEPs are calling on the Commission to establish a European observatory on violence against women."
"Thanks to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, an adopted amendment also calls for Member States to recognise rape and sexual violence within marriage or any other intimate relationship, as a crime."
"Violence against women is both a global and European issue."
"Domestic violence, prostitution, human trafficking, it is a disgrace that we are still not in a position to protect women from violence in our societies."
"Such gender-based violence is a violation of fundamental rights and freedoms, as well as of rights to safety and to human dignity."
"The issue here involves both preserving the integrity of victims and looking after the core collective interests of society, such as liberty and democracy."
"The European Union must shoulder its responsibilities and introduce legislation to put an end to this violence."
"I therefore voted for the introduction of measures such as a mechanism to facilitate access to free legal aid, financial aid arrangements aimed at promoting victims' independence and facilitating their return to normal life and the world of work."
"Respect for human rights is a fundamental value enshrined in the Treaty on European Union."
"So let us respect women's rights, too."
"in writing. - (SV) The European Parliament has voted in favour of an EU policy framework to combat violence against women."
"We welcome the decision and we voted in favour of the proposal as a whole."
"The decision was particularly important as it calls on the Commission to fulfil its previous promises to table a specific legislative proposal with a view to combating violence against women."
"However, the proposal contains certain wordings regarding surrogacy that we think were far too simplistic in their general negative attitude to this phenomenon and to international adoptions."
"We are not naive with regard to the problems surrounding surrogacy, but we do not want to attack something on account of these problems that in certain cases can be a positive experience for the parties involved."
"That is why we voted against those particular wordings concerning surrogacy - a position that our group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, also adopted in the original vote in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"Violence against women includes a number of serious violations of fundamental rights, such as sexual abuse, attacks on physical integrity and domestic violence, psychological violence, harassment or coercion, and the trafficking of women and their exploitation for prostitution, amongst many other examples of aggression that need to be combated determinedly by the Member States."
"I condemn all violence, but especially that used against those in a more vulnerable position - physically, socially, economically or emotionally - such as children and also women."
"That is exactly why the Member States must seek to eliminate all forms of violence against women, in particular trafficking for sexual exploitation, violation of their sexual self-determination, and attacks on their physical integrity."
"Respect for human life and dignity cannot exist side-by-side with the crimes of which many European women are victims, making firm policies on the prevention of violence and the punishment of its perpetrators necessary."
"The international community has been debating situations involving violence against women for a number of years."
"However, it is clear that they continue to be victims of violence: one fifth of European women have suffered acts of violence at least once."
"It is therefore important that the European Union adopt legislation to bring this tragedy to an end."
"Although the European Commission has come up with several initiatives to put an end to this scourge affecting millions of women throughout the world, not least by drawing up a new action plan on gender equality (2010-2015), the truth is that the EU cannot stand idly by while violations of women's fundamental rights are going unpunished, particularly in the following areas: sexual abuse, female genital mutilation and forced marriage, human trafficking and prostitution, lack of legal protection, etc."
"We cannot remain inactive, however."
"I therefore welcome the rapporteur's proposals, in particular the establishment of refuges for victims, an emergency number, and the institution of the European Year of Combating Violence against Women."
"Violence against women in its numerous forms - domestic violence, sexual violence, prostitution, the trafficking of women, sexual and psychological harassment, and violence against women in their places of work - represents a serious violation of human rights and freedoms, both individually and collectively, with profoundly negative social consequences."
"The prevention and eradication of violence against women need to constitute essential strategic objectives, the pursuit of which cannot de dissociated from the progress for which our civilisation is striving."
"Some studies on gender-based violence estimate that between a fifth and a quarter of Europe's female population have been victims of acts of physical violence at least once during their adult lives, and around one tenth of them have suffered sexual violence."
"It is also estimated that around 26% of children and young people report cases of physical violence during childhood and adolescence, which is particularly worrying if we take into account premises based on social learning, which hold that today's victim could potentially be tomorrow's attacker."
"It is important now that the guidance included in this report be implemented."
"We welcome the adoption of this report by the Member from our group, Mrs Svensson, who is also Chair of Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"We know that violence against women represents a serious violation of human rights and freedoms, both individually and collectively, with enormous social consequences, given that violence against women involves a wide range of human rights violations, including domestic violence, sexual violence, prostitution, the trafficking of women, sexual and psychological harassment, and violence against women in their places of work."
"The prevention and eradication of violence against women are essential strategic objectives important to the progress for which our civilisation is striving."
"Some studies on gender-based violence estimate that between a fifth and a quarter of Europe's female population have been victims of acts of physical violence at least once during their adult lives, and around one tenth of them have suffered sexual violence."
"It is also believed that around 26% of children and young people report cases of physical violence during childhood and adolescence, which is particularly worrying if we take into account premises based on social learning..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. - (IT) Violence against women is an evil in our society that we must fight at all costs."
"However, I cannot support this note given what is in my opinion the excessive attention it pays to female immigrants."
"Particularly at this time, such attention on the part of the EU and its governments should be highly visible, , and should not be confined to fine words in support of European projects."
"My group is divided on the matter."
"I voted in favour of Amendment 19 and recital J on the word 'prostitution' because I am of the opinion that prostitution is indeed an act of violence against women."
"Violence against women is a reality all too often overlooked: it is thought that between 20 and 25% of European women will have already been subjected to physical violence at least once in their adult life."
"Last week, the European Parliament adopted a report on this issue and on the need to establish a political framework in this area and I, for one, welcome it."
"Our report seeks to encourage all EU Member States to consider violence against women a crime and hence to establish an instrument under criminal law to combat this violence."
"Moreover, and importantly, I voted for the introduction of a mechanism to facilitate access to free legal aid, and for urgent psychological aid services to be provided free of charge for victims."
"I also supported the amendments recognising the 'serious problem of prostitution' and which consider that 'violence against women' encompasses prostitution."
"Lastly, I voted in favour of rape and sexual violence being considered a crime, even within marriage or any other type of intimate relationship."
"in writing. -- (IT) A European regulatory framework in the fight against violence against women represents one crucial step forward within a comprehensive strategy."
"Only a combination of legal, social, economic and preventive actions will manage to resolve this problem which is rather close to home, given that over a quarter of women in the European Union have experienced violence during their lifetime."
"Violence against women makes no distinction by age or ethnic or cultural background, and it remains an invisible problem that has nonetheless very high human, social and economic costs."
"The European Union must affirm its active role in fighting discrimination against women and that is why the Svensson report supports the European Commission in its attempts to create a clear and homogenous regulatory framework in the context of the Stockholm Programme."
"I am therefore in favour of the request for an instrument of criminal law which would define violence against women as a crime in itself, through the development of a directive against gender-based violence, to be brought in line with the multiple training, prevention and awareness-raising initiatives in order to fight all forms of abuse against women."
"I gave this report my vote, because in the 21st century it is vital that we ensure that rape is considered a crime everywhere in Europe and that the perpetrators of these crimes face criminal prosecution and punishment."
"It is not acceptable that at present, depending on which country they live in, not all victims of these hateful crimes enjoy the same opportunities to obtain justice and reparation for the violence done to them."
"The ball is now in the court of the Council and Commission, who surely will not prevent this crucial step towards helping women who are victims of this violence to obtain reparation for their suffering."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report, because we must stop all violations of women's rights and violence against women."
"I believe that according to the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme adopted last year, the Commission should draw up a strategy on combating violence against women as a matter of urgency."
"At the same time the Member States must ensure that healthcare providers, social workers, the police, courts and other institutions carry out improvements to enable them to respond to all cases of violence against women in a timely and professional manner."
"in writing. - (PL) It goes without saying that human dignity and the right to safety are fundamental values of life which must be protected."
"The very word 'violence' is so strongly charged with negative emotion that many people try to change the subject when gender-based violence is mentioned."
"However, it is our job to face up to difficult issues and to intervene in cases where society needs pointing in the right direction on political and legal questions."
"Let us not forget that violence against women, which includes the violation of dignity, sexual abuse, forced marriages and mutilation, is not only a problem for members of the female sex."
"It is a problem for the whole of society, and one which contributes to its widespread disintegration."
"The total costs are underestimated in this respect."
"Is it not the case that we all incur the expenditure resulting from such violence - the costs of medical care, psychological treatment, court proceedings and social care?"
"The victims are frequently not capable of holding down a job."
"The Member States should consider drafting a plan to combat gender-based violence."
"in writing. - (IT) The European Parliament has approved the proposal for a resolution on the establishment of a new EU policy framework in relation to the fight against violence against women."
"I strongly and ardently supported the resolution because I believe that the answer to this social plague must be provided on a single Union-wide basis by the European Union, through the instigation of coherent and efficient political action."
"Violence against women, whether physical, psychological or sexual is an expression of incivility which Europe must repudiate."
"It is a plague which leads to traumas which have repercussions of inestimable influence on the lives of women in society."
"Statistics currently available portray a sad and distressing reality."
"One European woman in four has been a victim of violence at least once in her lifetime."
"I believe therefore that the priorities for EU action should be the identification of Union-wide legal instruments, the possibility to make use of free support, the creation of refuges capable of providing psychological and moral assistance and the creation of a single emergency number throughout Europe."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"Gender-based violence is always primarily a criminal matter."
"Society must therefore respond with punishment which is proportional to the seriousness of the crime."
"In setting priorities for the allocation of society's resources, it is important to have a clear victim's perspective, since it is this group which currently needs special protective measures."
"This does not exclude devoting resources to individual offenders by, for example, offering conversation therapy and other methods to counteract violent behaviour."
"This form of alternative treatment for men who have committed serious assaults on women, however, should never replace the penalty imposed by criminal law."
"Conversation therapy and other such forms of treatment can only supplement other forms of punishment, such as prison."
"Violence is in large measure a consequence of unequal power relations between men and women, and is an expression of a domination/subordination relationship between the perpetrator and victim for these crimes, therefore, conversation therapy in which both victim and perpetrator take part must be regarded as out of the question since the crime is of such a nature that the two can never be equivalent and equal negotiating parties."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because violence against women continues to be a scourge in Europe and the world, despite the campaigns that the international community has been carrying out for several decades."
"It affects the direct victims in the first instance, but it also affects freedom and democracy themselves."
"I also voted for the report because it sets out a series of immediate measures that are needed to guarantee women a decent life, and it is clear that long-term political, social and legal measures are required to eliminate gender-based violence."
"Violence in general is to be condemned, but violence affecting those less able to defend themselves, namely children, the elderly and women, even more so."
"In this specific case, it is a concern of Parliament to put together a series of infrastructural, legal, judicial, enforcement, educational, health, and other actions that can significantly reduce violence against women and its consequences."
"I voted for the Svensson report on the new EU policy framework to combat violence against women because I am deeply concerned by that type of violence."
"It is reckoned that between 20% and 25% of European women have suffered physical violence at least once during their adult lives, and more than 10% have suffered sexual abuse."
"I therefore believe that the time has come to put a stop to male violence, and this will only be possible by building true equality between men and women."
"Furthermore, I am convinced that rape should be recognised as an offence throughout the European Union and its perpetrators brought to trial."
"This report also proposes a new prospect for combating this blight on society, not just through criminal proceedings, but also through protection from and prevention of the insecure jobs, unemployment and poverty that mean women often find themselves in situations of dependence, and make it impossible for them to choose their future freely."
"A European directive against gender violence is therefore becoming essential."
"The Member States must adopt measures to this end at the first opportunity."
"in writing. - Men's violence against women is a structural violation of women's human rights."
"Counting all forms of male violence against women, 45% of all women in Europe have been subject to and suffered from men's violence."
"It is estimated that the total cost of domestic violence within the 27 Member States could be as high as EUR 16 billion."
"However men's violence against women knows no geographical boundaries, no age limit, no class or race or cultural distinctions, it is still invisible and the victims are silenced."
"In 2008, I drafted amendments to the Latvian Republic's Criminal Law regarding domestic violence."
"Unfortunately, these amendments were rejected by the Latvian Parliament."
"I voted 'for'."
"in writing. - (DE) Despite the fact that there has been progress in recent decades and years in combating violence against women and children, there is still more work to be done."
"The apathy and pseudo-morality found in society should give us pause for thought."
"The early stages of actual violence, such as intrusiveness, obscene remarks and harassment meted out by many migrants to western women on a daily basis are increasingly regarded as normal."
"The disregard for women has reached peak levels when a German judge refers to the husband's right to use corporal punishment anchored in the Koran as a decisive factor in her judgment on a Muslim divorce case."
"By permitting migration, the EU has imported problems from every conceivable quarter, including honour killings, forced marriages and domestic violence in patriarchal family structures."
"Culture, religion and tradition should not be used to justify acts of violence."
"The proposed initiative includes a number of good ideas, but remains quite superficial overall, which is why I chose to abstain."
"in writing. - (DE) The report draws attention to a number of serious cases of violence against women."
"I am referring to sexual abuse, physical violence within the family, enforced prostitution, forced marriage and female circumcision."
"Unfortunately, all of these terrible things can also take place in our society here in the EU."
"The report picks up on this fact, but fails to get to the root of the problem, which often lies in parallel societies, archaic Islamic structures or organised gangs of traffickers."
"We need to work on this area."
"Therefore, I have abstained from voting."
"I voted in favour of the report on violence against women, an initiative which will help women in Europe to live a dignified life."
"According to the statistics, approximately one-fifth of women living in Europe have been the victim of violence and 20% have experienced violence from persons close to them."
"The provisions in this report for combating violence against women are important, because: it calls on the Member States to punish perpetrators in accordance with the gravity of the crime committed (sexual abuse, human trafficking, forced marriages, female circumcision); it provides the resources needed to help the victims of violence, such as legal assistance, and to create refuges for victims; it provides legal assistance to victims and requires all forms of gender-based violence to be subject to public prosecution; it makes provision for more information for young women through proper education in the risks which they run."
"However, I voted against the proposal to increase the number of courts with jurisdiction to hear cases of gender-based violence, because any such proposal introduces unacceptable discrimination and conflicts with the principle of gender equality."
"It is essential to break the silence surrounding all forms of crime, and in this case that based on gender."
"Offences that take the form of violence in the home, sexual abuse, human trafficking, genital mutilation and other forms of violations of integrity that affect women and girls in particular should be made public in order that they may be combated more effectively."
"In fact, greater knowledge of gender-based violence would make it possible to increase society's sensitivity to this problem."
"This own-initiative report on of the European Parliament seeks to put together a series of the measures required to ensure that European women have a decent life."
"Despite violence against women having been a topic of debate for several decades, the international community has not succeeded in bringing this extremely destructive form of crime to an end."
"In summary, I believe the European Union needs to adopt the necessary legislation to put an end to this violence, and the Member States need to draw up national action plans for combating gender-based violence."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - (IT) Violence against women is an international as well as a European problem."
"Gender-based violence covers offences in the form of violence in close relationships, sexual abuse, human trafficking and prostitution, forced marriages, genital mutilation and other forms of violations against personal integrity which particularly affect women and young girls."
"To this end, it is necessary that we adopt a series of political, social and juridical policies so that we are able to guarantee a decent standard of life to European women."
"In the initiative report, the European Parliament stresses that it is possible to eliminate this kind of violence by first of all instituting comprehensive and coherent legislative protection of women's integrity."
"It is also necessary to record the extent of this type of criminality, to make courts aware of what a sexual assault implies, to detect this kind of violence at an early stage through proactive and preventive measures, to ensure legal clarity during investigations and trials, to establish new refuges and an emergency phone number for victims, and to fund research in this area."
"On the basis of observations made previously, I am voting in favour of concretely enacting all measures necessary to fight this type of violence and to draw up effective action plans to combat its occurrence."
"in writing. - Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of debate over several decades, the international community has not managed to put an end to this extremely destructive form of criminality."
"It is a complex problem which involves protecting the integrity of individual victims of crime but also protecting important common social interests, such as freedom and democracy."
"Shelters for women must be provided at national level in order to enable women and children to live a self-determined life free of violence and poverty."
"Such shelters should offer specialised services, medical treatment, legal aid, psychosocial and therapeutic counselling, legal support during court procedure, support for children affected by violence, and so on. The Member States should ensure appropriate funding means in order that women's shelters can fulfil international standards in working with women survivors of violence and their children."
"The Member States should provide the required means for women's organisation and NGOs in order to protect and prevent women and their children from violence and poverty, should guarantee social and economic rights of women so that they do not depend on a partner/husband financially and should promote and develop an integration of women on the labour market."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because violence against women continues to be a scourge in Europe and the world, despite the campaigns that the international community has been carrying out for several decades."
"It affects the direct victims in the first instance, but it also affects freedom and democracy themselves."
"I also voted for the report because it sets out a series of immediate measures that are needed to guarantee women a decent life, and it is clear that long-term political, social and legal measures are required to eliminate gender-based violence."
"One in four women in Europe have experienced physical acts of violence during their adult lives and one in ten have been victims of sexual violence involving the use of force."
"In the face of figures like these, it is urgent that we act to combat this violence against women in the European Union."
"I am therefore supporting the report by Mrs Svensson."
"Rape, which at present is still not considered a criminal offence in several Member States, and other forms of sexual violence against women, must be recognised as crimes in all countries in the Union and the perpetrators must be automatically prosecuted."
"In order to protect women migrants and asylum seekers, I also call for a legal framework to be established that gives immigrant women the right to hold their own passport and residence permit and makes it possible to hold a person 'criminally responsible' for taking these documents away."
"Furthermore, I call for easier access to legal aid, in order to allow victims to assert their rights."
"I believe it is essential for this aid to be free and would have liked this point to have appeared clearly in the report."
", in writing - (CS) It is always important to combat violence against women, which takes many shapes and forms, leaving its marks both on the body and on the mind, and leading the victims of violence even to commit suicide in some cases."
"I am pleased that we are creating a new framework for the EU's fight against this unacceptable phenomenon, and I was therefore happy to vote in favour of the report."
"However, I was unable to vote for the parts of the report leading towards support for the artificial termination of pregnancy, as I disagree with this, because the as yet unborn human being has a right to life."
"in writing. - Violence against women is an international as well as a European problem."
"Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of debate over several decades, the international community has not managed to put an end to this extremely destructive form of criminality."
"It is distressing to see how we still fail to protect women against violence."
"It is a complex problem which involves protecting the integrity of individual victims of crime but also protecting important common social interests, such as freedom and democracy."
"The European Union must therefore shoulder its responsibility and introduce the legislation required to put an end to the violence."
"I recognise the compilation made by the rapporteur of a number of measures in this strategic report which are absolutely necessary in order to guarantee women in Europe a decent life."
"However, due to the fact that recital J establishes that prostitution as such is a violation of human rights, and given the effort we are making to regulate such practices, some members of our group had to abstain in the end."
"in writing. - (IT) I would have liked to have voted in favour of the report into the fight against violence against women because its aim was to establish comprehensive measures to protect women who have been the victims of violence."
"It tackles in a clear way sexual abuse, prostitution, female genital mutilation, stalking, human trafficking and domestic violence: in short, a series of violations of women's rights."
"As often occurs at the European Parliament, the problem is that every text exceeds itself by inserting matters that would be better handled in unrelated documents."
"In this case, the report deals with the rights of migrant and refugee women, who are treated as a select category of women compared to other female European citizens."
"For this simple reason I am abstaining, since despite agreeing with the aims of the document, I cannot tolerate the manipulation of policy."
"I voted in favour of this particular resolution, because it introduces a framework for a new European policy to fight violence against women."
"It proposes a series of clear-cut political measures to fight gender-based violence, including measures to combat human trafficking, which I consider to be particularly important, given the worrying increase in human trafficking to and within the EU, especially of women and children."
